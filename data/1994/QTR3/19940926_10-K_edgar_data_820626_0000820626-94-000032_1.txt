       PART I.



       Item 1.  Business.

       INTRODUCTION
       ------------


       Company Profile
       ---------------

           IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc. is the parent corporation of several
       subsidiaries and joint venture operations which together comprise one
       of the world's leading producers of crop nutrients for the
       international community.  The Company mines and processes potash in the
       United States and Canada, and is a joint venture partner in IMC-Agrico
       Company, the nation's largest producer, marketer and distributor of
       phosphate crop nutrients.  The Company believes that it is one of the
       lower cost North American producers of phosphate rock, potash and
       concentrated phosphates.  The Company also manufactures high-value crop
       nutrients which are marketed principally in the southeastern United
       States under the Rainbow (Registered Trademark) brand name.  In
       addition, it produces sulphur and oil at other joint venture businesses
       and operates a railcar repair facility in Georgia.

           On July 1, 1993, IMC Fertilizer, Inc. (IMCF), a wholly-owned
       subsidiary of the Company, entered into a joint venture partnership
       with Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, Limited Partnership (FRP)
       pursuant to which IMCF and FRP contributed their respective phosphate
       businesses to create IMC-Agrico Company (IMC-Agrico or the
       Partnership).  The activities of IMC-Agrico, which is operated by IMCF,
       include the mining and sale of phosphate rock and the production,
       distribution and sale of concentrated phosphates, uranium oxide and
       related products.

           The Company's business strategy focuses on maintaining its
       worldwide position as a leading crop nutrient producer and supplier
       through extensive customer service, efficient distribution and
       transportation, and to supply crop nutrient products worldwide at
       competitive prices by taking advantage of economies of scale and
       state-of-the-art technology to reduce costs.

           The corporate headquarters of the Company is located at 2100
       Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois 60062-6198, and the telephone number
       is (708) 272-9200.

           Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the "Company" or
       "IMC" includes IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc. and its consolidated
       subsidiaries, including, subsequent to June 30, 1993, IMC-Agrico.
       Unless otherwise specified, references herein to years are fiscal years
       ended June 30.


       Seasonal and Other Factors Affecting the Company's Business
       -----------------------------------------------------------

           In general, the Company's product lines are not materially affected
       by seasonal factors except in the case of its high-value crop nutrients
       product line.
<PAGE>


           The Company's revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the
       domestic agriculture industry, and can be affected by crop failure,
       changes in agricultural productivity and agricultural policies, and
       weather, all of which are beyond the Company's control.

           In addition, the Company's results of operations can also be
       affected by other factors beyond its control such as the relative value
       of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon costs to the importers of crop
       nutrients; the status of domestic and foreign political subsidies of
       agriculture, and other factors.


       Methods of Competition
       ----------------------

           The Company's products are commodities that are available from
       other sources, and the marketplaces in which these products are sold,
       both domestic and foreign, are highly competitive.  Apart from
       competitive pricing, the Company's principal method of competition is
       in service to customers.  Such service includes the maintenance of an
       extensive North American transportation system made up of approximately
       2,500 railroad cars, both leased and owned, the maintenance of in-
       market warehouse networks to meet changing needs within the domestic
       marketplace, and the operation of ocean terminals for the storage and
       shipment of product to international markets.



       PRODUCT LINE INFORMATION
       ------------------------

           The Company's most significant investments in plants and properties
       in the United States are in its phosphate operations in Florida and
       Louisiana and its potash operations in New Mexico.  The Company also
       has 25 percent participation interests in joint ventures to mine
       sulphur and oil & natural gas deposits offshore Louisiana.  The most
       significant investment outside the United States is in its potash
       operations in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada.  In February 1992,
       the Company sold its two anhydrous ammonia plants located in
       Sterlington, Louisiana.

           The amounts and relative proportion of net sales and operating
       earnings contributed by various product lines of the Company have
       varied from year to year and may continue to do so in the future as a
       result of changing business, economic and competitive conditions, and
       technical developments.

           The table below shows the Company's sales by product line in
       millions of dollars for each of the past five years:

           The Company is not dependent upon any single customer or group of
       related or affiliated customers whose loss would have a material effect
       on its sales or operating results.

       IMC-Agrico Company
       -------------------

           On July 1, 1993, IMCF and FRP entered into a joint venture
       partnership pursuant to which IMCF and FRP contributed their respective
       phosphate businesses, including the mining and sale of phosphate rock
       and the production, distribution and sale of concentrated phosphates,
       uranium oxide and related products (the Business) to IMC-Agrico, a
       Delaware general partnership.  IMCF has a 56.5 percent interest in the
       Partnership over the term of the Partnership.  The Partnership is
       governed by a Policy Committee which has equal representation from each
       company and is being operated by IMCF.  The Partnership Agreement
       governing the Partnership contains a cash sharing arrangement under
       which distributable cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) was
       shared in 1994 at a ratio of 41.4 percent and 58.6 percent to IMCF and
       FRP, respectively, and will be adjusted thereafter until 1998 when the
       sharing ratio will be fixed at 59.4 percent and 40.6 percent to IMCF
       and FRP, respectively.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, the
       assets contributed to the Partnership by IMCF and FRP accounted for
       sales of approximately $1.2 billion and at June 30, 1993, such assets
       had an aggregate net book value of approximately $1.6 billion.

           The formation of the Partnership continues the Company's strategy
       of pursuing competitive cost positions in its markets.  As a result of
       this transaction, IMC-Agrico has realized transportation and
       distribution cost savings by reducing unit costs to transport product
       between various IMC-Agrico locations, by taking advantage of multiple
       shipping locations to reduce the cost to transport product to
       customers, and by reducing per unit warehousing costs through
       opportunities created by the size of the Partnership as compared to the
       two partners. IMC-Agrico has reduced production costs by eliminating
       duplicative plant administrative functions, by applying operational
       technologies that have proven successful at each of the Partner's
       respective plant locations to the other Partner's contributed plants
       and by more efficiently utilizing in-process product at plants that
       have previously had underutilized upgrading capacity.  IMC's and FRP's
       selling, general and administrative expenses have been reduced through
       reduced headcount which was achieved by eliminating duplicative
       headquarters functions and consolidating the Partners' sales forces.

           The following discussion describes the Company's operations,
       including those of IMC-Agrico.  Subsequent to June 30, 1993, all of
       IMC's phosphate rock and concentrated phosphate operations are
       conducted through IMC-Agrico.


       Phosphate Rock
       --------------

           IMC-Agrico's phosphate mining operations and production plants,
       located in Polk, Hillsborough, Hardee and Manatee counties in central
       Florida, produce phosphate rock, with production principally going into
<PAGE>

       the manufacture of concentrated phosphates.  The Partnership sells
       phosphate rock to crop nutrient manufacturers in the United States, to
       foreign distributors and manufacturers, to animal feed manufacturers
       for the production of feed phosphates, and uses it internally in the
       production of concentrated phosphates at its New Wales, Nichols and
       South Pierce production facilities located in central Florida and its
       Faustina and Uncle Sam production facilities located in Louisiana.
       Phosphate rock is generally mixed with sulfuric acid to produce
       phosphoric acid from which various concentrated phosphates can be
       produced.  About 83 percent of U.S. phosphate rock is produced in
       Florida and North Carolina.  The Florida/North Carolina production rate
       was at 64 percent of capacity for 1994, including idle and unused
       facilities.


       Production and Reserves

           Phosphate deposits were formed 15 million years ago by mineral
       precipitation from seawater.  Varying in thickness from five to 25
       feet, these deposits are covered by a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy
       overburden.  The ore is extracted through surface mining after removal
       of the overburden and is then processed at one of IMC-Agrico's 10
       plants (three of which were temporary idled at June 30, 1994) where it
       goes through washing, screening, sizing and flotation procedures
       designed to separate it from sands, clays and other foreign materials.

           IMC-Agrico's production capacity is approximately 31.5 million tons
       of product per year.  However, production has been at less than
       capacity because of reduced demand and actions to control inventory.

           IMC-Agrico's Kingsford mine, which was idled beginning May 1, 1993
       due to weak market conditions, was reopened March 1, 1994.  On October
       1, 1993, IMC-Agrico resumed operations at its Clear Springs mine which
       had been closed since September 1, 1991.  On August 1, 1994, IMC-Agrico
       resumed operations at its Payne Creek mine, idled since October 1,
       1993.

           The phosphate rock mines contributed by FRP to the Partnership
       produced 8.8 million tons of phosphate rock in 1993.

           IMC-Agrico has estimated reserves of 358 million tons of phosphate
       rock in central Florida as of June 30, 1994 that are mineable from
       existing operations.  Certain mining setback restrictions imposed by
       Hillsborough County, Florida authorities have impaired IMC-Agrico's
       ability to mine approximately 13 million tons of phosphate rock
       reserves at IMC-Agrico's Four Corners mine, which restrictions are
       being challenged by IMC-Agrico.  Central Florida reserves are contained
       in 44,764 mineable acres owned by IMC-Agrico or controlled by it
       through long-term lease or royalty agreements.  Reserve grades range
       from 58 percent to 78 percent bone phosphate of lime (BPL), with an
       average grade of 68 percent BPL.  (Bone phosphate of lime is the
<PAGE>

       standard industry term used to grade phosphate rock.)  The phosphate
       rock mined by the Company in the last three years averaged 69 percent
       BPL, which is typical for phosphate rock mined in Florida during this
       period.

          In March 1994, IMC-Agrico and U.S. Agri-Chemicals (USAC) entered
       into an agreement in which IMC-Agrico agreed to mine certain phosphate
       rock reserves owned by USAC and process such reserves for its own use.
       In return, IMC-Agrico agreed to supply all of USAC's internal phosphate
       rock requirements (1.3 to 2.0 million tons per year) at its Fort Meade,
       Florida, concentrated phosphate facility beginning October 1, 1994 at a
       price based on IMC-Agrico's cost of production.  This agreement will
       end on September 30, 2004, at which time it may be renewed, if agreed
       to by both parties, for an additional five years.

          In July 1994, IMC-Agrico entered into an option agreement with
       Mississippi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to purchase 9,472 acres of land
       in Florida (the Property).  The Property, along with 2,508 acres of
       land previously purchased from MCC (the Adjacent Property), contains
       approximately 87.5 million tons of phosphate rock reserves.  The option
       period began July 16, 1994 and will end January 15, 1998.  During this
       time, IMC-Agrico may exercise its option to purchase the Property or it
       may continue to make annual payments ranging from $1.0 to $3.0 million
       to keep the option in effect.  If by the end of the option period
       IMC-Agrico exercises its option to purchase the Property, the purchase
       price will be financed by MCC over a six-year term at interest rates
       approximating IMC-Agrico's borrowing rate.  If at any time during the
       option period IMC-Agrico fails to make an option payment or fails to
       exercise its option by January 15, 1998, MCC has the right to sell the
       Property to IMC-Agrico for a specified amount.  If the option to
       purchase the Property is not exercised by IMC-Agrico and MCC does not
       exercise its right to sell the Property to IMC-Agrico, MCC has the
       right to purchase the Adjacent Property from IMC-Agrico at an agreed
       upon price.

           In June 1994, the Company purchased two phosphate rock processing
       plants which previously had been leased under a long-term contract with
       Brewster Phosphates.  The annual capacity of these two plants is
       approximately five million tons.  Currently, both plants are closed
       indefinitely subject to improved market conditions.

           In October 1989, the Company purchased phosphate rock reserves and
       rock processing facilities from Hopewell Land Corporation.  The mine is
       located in eastern Hillsborough County and has an annual capacity of
       approximately 500,000 tons.  At June 30, 1994, the land tract contained
       an estimated 8.3 million tons of reserves with an average product grade
       of 72 BPL.

           IMC-Agrico also owns or controls phosphate rock deposits in
       Manatee, DeSoto and Hardee counties, Florida, about 40 miles south of
       current mining operations, which are called the South Florida deposits.
       (Reserves are ore bodies which are believed to be economically
       recoverable at current costs and prices.  Deposits are ore bodies which
       require additional economic and mining feasibility studies before they
       can be classified as reserves.)  These deposits differ in physical and
       chemical characteristics from the reserves now being mined in Polk,
       Hillsborough and Manatee counties, Florida.  The South Florida deposits
       contain estimated recoverable phosphate rock of approximately 533
       million tons (289 million tons of which are available under option
       arrangements) with an average grade of approximately 65 percent BPL.
       Some of these deposits are located in what may be classified as
<PAGE>

       unmineable wetland areas under standards set forth in current state and
       federal dredge and fill regulations.


       The Market

           IMC-Agrico sells its phosphate rock under long-term contracts and
       in the spot market.  IMC-Agrico also consumes a significant portion of
       its phosphate rock in the production of concentrated phosphates at its
       New Wales, Nichols, South Pierce, Faustina and Uncle Sam facilities.

           Most of IMC-Agrico's export sales of phosphate rock are made
       through the Phosphate Rock Export Association, formed under the Webb-
       Pomerene Act by IMC and certain other Florida phosphate rock producers.
       Under that Act, members of an industry may form associations to
       negotiate prices and other terms for the export sales of their products
       in order to compete more effectively in foreign markets.  Export
       markets for phosphate rock are highly competitive, with the
       nationally-controlled mines of Morocco and other countries being
       significant factors in terms of supply and price.

           IMC-Agrico's phosphate rock shipments in millions of tons for 1994
       and 1993 were as follows:

                                            1994               1993

           The phosphate rock business contributed by FRP to the Partnership
       shipped 7.9 million tons of phosphate rock in 1993, 900,000 tons of
       which were exported and 7.0 million tons of which were used in FRP's
       concentrated phosphate operations.

           Overall, phosphate rock prices averaged $21.16 per ton in 1994 vs.
       $22.72 per ton in 1993 .



       Concentrated Phosphates

       -----------------------

           Once phosphate rock is mined, it can then be processed into
       concentrated phosphates.  Concentrated phosphate production facilities
       are located in Florida and Louisiana.  The Florida concentrated
       phosphate facilities consist of three plants:  New Wales, Nichols and
       South Pierce. New Wales primarily manufactures four forms of
       concentrated phosphates:  diammonium (DAP) and monoammonium (MAP)
       phosphates, granular triple superphosphate (GTSP), and merchant grade
       phosphoric acid.  The New Wales concentrated phosphate complex, located
       near Mulberry, Florida, is the largest concentrated phosphate plant in
<PAGE>

       the world with an estimated annual capacity of 1.76 million tons of
       phosphoric acid (P2O5 equivalent).  P2O5 is an industry term indicating
       a product's phosphate content measured chemically in units of
       phosphorous pentoxide.

           In December 1992, the Company acquired a DAP plant near Nichols,
       Florida, formerly owned by Conserv, Inc.  In May 1993, the Company
       idled the Nichols plant, which represented approximately 20 percent of
       the Company's DAP production capacity, in response to severe price
       erosion.  Operations were resumed in May 1994 in response to lower
       finished goods inventories and to meet anticipated international
       demand.  The Nichols plant has an estimated annual capacity of 600,000
       tons of DAP.

           The South Pierce plant, located at Bartow, Florida, produces
       sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, GTSP, and technical grade DAP and MAP
       for industrial uses.  South Pierce has an estimated annual capacity of
       520,000 tons of phosphoric acid or 760,000 tons GTSP.

           The Louisiana concentrated phosphate facilities consist of three
       plants:  Faustina, Uncle Sam and Taft.  Faustina has facilities for the
       production of anhydrous ammonia, urea, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,
       DAP and MAP. Uncle Sam has facilities for the production of sulfuric
       acid, and phosphoric acid.  These plants have an estimated annual
       capacity to produce 530,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia, 260,000 tons of
       urea, approximately 3.85 million tons of sulfuric acid and
       approximately 1.47 million tons of phosphoric acid.  Taft has
       facilities with the annual estimated capacity to upgrade phosphoric
       acid into 1.0 million tons of DAP and MAP.

           IMC-Agrico's annual concentrated phosphate production capacity is
       approximately four million tons of phosphoric acid (P2O5 equivalent),
       or approximately 32 percent of total U.S. concentrated phosphate
       production capacity, or 11 percent of world capacity.

           As a result of the then current oversupply of, and reduced demand
       for, DAP, IMC-Agrico reduced temporarily its DAP output by
       approximately 40 percent of capacity in July 1993 by, among other
       things, idling its Taft plant and reducing operations at New Wales.
       Subsequently, IMC-Agrico gradually increased production at New Wales
       and, in December 1993, the Taft plant resumed operations to meet the
       demand of the U.S. spring planting season until May 1994, when it again
       was idled.

           Phosphate rock, sulphur and ammonia are the three principal raw
       materials used in the production of concentrated phosphates.  Phosphate
       rock is supplied by IMC-Agrico's Florida mines.  Sulphur, until
       recently, was purchased exclusively from domestic suppliers.  The
       Company and FRP both have interests in a joint venture which began
       mining sulphur reserves at Main Pass 299 (Main Pass) offshore Louisiana
       in April 1992.  Sulphur production achieved design operating rates of
       5,500 long tons per day or approximately two million long tons per year
       in December 1993 and has since sustained production at or above that
       level.  The Company and FRP have entered into an agreement to supply
       IMC-Agrico's sulphur requirements.  FRP  supplies its share of the
       requirements through its Sulphur Division and the Company supplies its
       share of the requirements through its share of Main Pass production and
       purchases from third parties.  Nearly all of the Company's ammonia
       needs were supplied by the Company's Louisiana production facilities
       until February 1992, when the operations were sold.  Since then,
       IMC-Agrico's needs primarily have been fulfilled by its Faustina
<PAGE>

       ammonia production facility and by domestic suppliers under long-term
       contracts.


       The Market

           IMC-Agrico sells its concentrated phosphates in the spot market and
       under long-term contracts.  Virtually all of IMC-Agrico's export sales
       are marketed through the Phosphate Chemicals Export Association, a
       Webb-Pomerene Act organization.  The table below shows the Company's
       1994 and 1993 shipments in thousands of tons of P2O5 equivalent:

           In 1993, the concentrated phosphate business contributed by FRP to
       the Partnership sold 1.2 million tons of concentrated phosphates (P2O5
       equivalent) domestically and 1.0 million tons of concentrated
       phosphates (P2O5 equivalent) for export.

           IMC-Agrico has contractual commitments from customers for the
       shipment of concentrated phosphates amounting to approximately 500,000
       tons (P2O5 equivalent) in fiscal 1995.


       Animal Feed Ingredients Agreements

           The Company has a management agreement with Mallinckrodt
       Veterinary, Inc. (Mallinckrodt), formerly Pitman-Moore, Inc., a wholly-
       owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt Group Inc., formerly IMCERA Group
       Inc., under which the Company operates certain Mallinckrodt facilities
       at the New Wales concentrated phosphate complex, which manufacture
       animal feed-grade phosphate products, and supplies utilities for the
       operation of such facilities until at least June 30, 1997.  There is
       also a similar management agreement under which the Company operates a
       limestone mine for Mallinckrodt Group Inc. to obtain limestone for use
       in the animal feed plant.  Under the management agreement, charges for
       the conversion of raw materials, described below, into finished
       products, as well as for supplying utilities to the plant, are based on
       the Company's actual cost.

           In addition, IMC-Agrico has supply agreements with Mallinckrodt
       under which IMC-Agrico will supply Mallinckrodt's requirements of raw
       materials for its animal feed plant.  Under these agreements,
       IMC-Agrico will supply phosphoric acid through at least June 30, 1997
       and anhydrous ammonia on a year-to-year basis unless terminated by
       either party.  In addition, IMC-Agrico has an agreement to supply
<PAGE>

       Mallinckrodt 85,000 to 105,000 tons of phosphate rock annually until
       June 30, 1998.  The Company has also entered into an agreement to
       supply Mallinckrodt with its requirements of animal feed-grade
       potassium products from the Company's Carlsbad, New Mexico, potash
       operations.  These supply contracts extend year-to-year unless
       terminated by either party.  The Company also supplies Mallinckrodt
       with railcars for transporting its product.



       Potash
       ------

           The Company mines potash, the second primary crop nutrient, at
       three underground mines and modern refineries in the United States and
       Canada.  Two of the mines and refineries are located near the town of
       Esterhazy in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.  The remaining mine
       and refinery is located near Carlsbad, New Mexico.  With a combined
       capacity of over five million tons per year, the Company is one of the
       largest private enterprise potash producers in the world.  In 1994,
       these operations accounted for approximately 8 percent of world output.

           The term potash applies generally to the common salts of potassium.
       Since the amount of potassium in these salts varies, the industry has
       established a common standard of measurement by defining a product's
       potassium content in terms of equivalent percentages of potassium oxide
       (K20).  A K20 equivalent of 60 percent is the customary minimum
       standard for muriate of potash products.

           The North American potash industry's production rate was at 75
       percent of capacity for 1994, including idle and unused facilities.
       Most of the potash produced by the Company was sold as crop nutrient
       materials, while small portions were sold as animal feed ingredients
       and to non-agricultural markets.


       Saskatchewan Potash Operations

           The Company's two interconnected potash mines in Saskatchewan are
       owned and operated by a wholly-owned subsidiary, International Minerals
       & Chemical Corporation (Canada) Limited (IMC-Canada).  The total annual
       production capacity of IMC-Canada's refinery facilities is estimated to
       be 4.2 million tons of finished product.

           Potash mining takes place under ground at depths of over 3,000 feet
       where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and move jagged
       chunks of salt to conveyor belts.  The ore is then crushed and moved to
       storage bins where it awaits hoisting to refineries above ground.  IMC-
       Canada produces six different potash products, some through patented
       processes.  Product grades produced are Standard, Special Standard,
       Coarse, Granular and White Muriate, and Refined KCL.

           Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PCS) controls several
       potash-producing properties in the province.  The mining operations
       associated with these properties give PCS control of approximately 55
       percent of Saskatchewan's potash production capacity.

           One of PCS's properties consists of reserves located in the
       vicinity of IMC-Canada's potash operations.  Under a long-term contract
       with PCS, IMC-Canada is obligated to mine and refine these reserves for
       a fee plus a pro rata share of production costs.  The specified
<PAGE>

       quantities of potash to be produced for PCS may, at the option of PCS,
       amount to an annual maximum of approximately one-fourth of the tons
       produced by IMC-Canada, but no more than 1,050,000 tons.  The current
       contract can be continued in effect until June 30, 1996, and, at the
       option of PCS, can be renewed on the same terms for six additional
       five-year periods.

           Since December 1985, the Company has experienced an inflow of water
       into one of its two interconnected potash mines.  As a result, the
       Company has suffered losses and has been forced to take substantial
       remedial efforts to stop the flooding.  Remedial efforts are ongoing,
       with $25 million (Canadian) having been expended in 1994 and $29
       million (Canadian) expected to be spent in 1995.

           The Company has significantly reduced the water inflow since the
       initial discovery and has been able to meet all sales obligations and
       requirements from production at the mines.  Despite the relative
       success of such measures, there can be no assurance that the amounts
       required for remedial efforts in the future will not increase or that
       inflows will not increase to a level which would cause the Company to
       abandon the mine.  There can be no assurance that such action would not
       have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The long-term trend of
       the water inflow has caused the Company to consider alternatives to its
       current mining operations and studies are under way in this regard.
       Any solution to the water inflow situation at the mines could result in
       substantial capital expenditures.  The Company does not presently have
       in place, nor can it reasonably obtain, any insurance to cover damage
       to its underground potash operations.

           In 1987, legislation was adopted in the province of Saskatchewan
       that authorized the provincial government to control production at
       potash mines located in the province.  The provincial government stated
       that the purpose of such legislation was to deal with an oversupply of
       potash in world markets.  The legislation was not self-implementing.
       It permitted the Lieutenant Governor in Council of Saskatchewan to
       create a Potash Resources Board to prescribe rates of potash production
       in the province and to allocate production among the individual mines.
       Increases in production capacity would be subject to provincial
       approval.  The Company understands that such regulations are in place
<PAGE>

       but that they have never been implemented.  The Company cannot predict
       if or when the legislation will be implemented or the effects of this
       legislation on the profitability of its potash operations.


       Saskatchewan Potash Reserves

           IMC-Canada presently controls the rights to mine 204,446 acres of
       potash-bearing land in southeastern Saskatchewan.  This land, of which
       50,284 acres have already been mined or abandoned, contains over 1.4
       billion tons of recoverable ore at an average grade of 24.5 percent K2O
       -- enough to support current operations for more than a century.  This
       ore will yield approximately 500 million tons of finished product with
       a K2O content of approximately 61 percent.

           IMC-Canada's mineral rights consist of 113,068 acres owned in fee,
       70,613 acres leased from the province of Saskatchewan, and 20,765 acres
       leased from other parties.  All leases are renewable by IMC-Canada for
       successive terms of 21 years.  Royalties, established by regulation of
       the province of Saskatchewan, amounted to $3.7 million (Canadian) in
       1994 and $3.6 million (Canadian) 1993.


       Agreement Suspending Potash Dumping Investigation

           In January 1988, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) signed
       an agreement with all of the potash producers in Canada, suspending an
       investigation by Commerce to determine whether Canadian potash was, or
       was likely to be, sold in the United States at less than "fair value."
       The agreement stipulated that each such producer's minimum price for
       potash sold in the United States, compared with its potash prices in
       Canada, would be based upon a formula related to preliminary dumping
       margins determined by Commerce for each producer, to assure that there
       would be no dumping by that producer in the future.  Compliance with
       the agreement is being monitored by Commerce.  Originally, this
       agreement was to remain in effect until 1993 unless it was terminated
       by Commerce or by the withdrawal from the agreement by producers having
       15 percent or more of the total Canadian capacity, or unless there was
       a violation of the terms of the agreement, in any of which events the
       investigation could be renewed.  In January 1993, this agreement was
       extended by Commerce for an indefinite period.  The intent of the
       agreement is to prevent the sale of Canadian potash into the United
       States at less than "fair value."


       Saskatchewan Potash Production Costs

           In addition to royalties, mining payments to the province of
       Saskatchewan amounted to $5 million in 1994 and $8 million in 1993.
       These payments are not deductible in determining Canadian federal
       income taxes.


       Carlsbad Potash Operations

           The Company's Carlsbad mine, located in New Mexico with workings at
       levels 700 to 900 feet under ground, has an annual production capacity
       of over one million tons of finished product.  The ore mined is of
       three types:  (1) sylvinite, a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium
       chloride, the same as the ore mined in Saskatchewan; (2) langbeinite, a
<PAGE>

       double sulphate of potassium and magnesium; and (3) a mixed ore,
       containing both potassium chloride and langbeinite.

           Conventional mining methods are utilized for ore extraction.  A
       wide ore face is undercut and holes drilled to accept explosive
       charges.  After detonation, the loose ore is loaded and transported to
       storage areas where it is hoisted above ground for further processing
       at the refinery.

           Three types of potash are produced at the refinery:  muriate of
       potash, which is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient
       industry; a double sulphate of potash magnesia, marketed under the
       brand name Sul-Po-Mag (Registered Trademark), containing significant
       amounts of sulphur, potassium and magnesium, with low levels of
       chlorine; and sulphate of potash, supplying sulphur and a high
       concentration of potassium with low levels of chlorine.  The Company
       believes it is the larger of the two U.S. producers of double sulphate
       of potash magnesia and the largest of several U.S. producers of
       sulphate of potash.


       Carlsbad Potash Production

           The five-year table below shows Carlsbad production figures in
       thousands of tons:

       Carlsbad Potash Reserves

           The Company mines and refines potash from 43,239 acres of reserves
       which the Company controls under long-term leases.  These reserves
       contain an estimated total of 169 million tons of recoverable ore in
       four mining beds at thicknesses ranging from 5.5 to 12.0 feet.  At
       average refinery rates, these ore reserves are estimated to be
       sufficient to yield 12.5 million tons of concentrate from sylvinite
       with an average grade of 60 percent K2O and 29.3 million tons of
       langbeinite concentrate with an average grade of approximately 22
       percent K2O.

           At current elevated rates of production, the Company's reserves of
       sylvinite and langbeinite are estimated to be sufficient to support
       operations for more than 24 years.


       Total IMC Potash Production

           In addition to the Company, there are 12 North American potash
       producers -- seven in the United States and five in Canada.  The
       following five-year table compares the Company's combined U.S. and
       Canadian production with total North American production, in thousands
       of tons of K2O equivalent, as reported by the Potash and Phosphate
       Institute:

       The Market

           Potash is sold throughout the world, with the Company's largest
       markets being in the United States, People's Republic of China, Japan,
       Malaysia, Korea and Latin America.  Potash is also used internally in
       the manufacture of high-value crop nutrients.  The Company's exports
       from Canada, except to the United States, are made through Canpotex
       Limited, an export association of Saskatchewan potash producers.

           The following table summarizes the Company's shipments of potash in
       thousands of tons in 1994 and 1993:
                                             1994             1993

           The average selling price for all Company potash products was $64
       per ton in 1994, compared with $68 per ton in 1993.



       Rainbow Division
       ----------------

           The Company's Rainbow Division produces high-value crop nutrients
       through granulation and bulk-blending.  Granulation is a process in
       which various dry and liquid raw materials are chemically combined and
       then pelletized.  Bulk-blending is a simple physical mixing or blending
       of suitable crop nutrient materials.

           The Rainbow Division operates four large granulation plants which
       are located in Americus, Georgia, Florence, Alabama, Hartsville, South
       Carolina and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  It also operates 15
       smaller facilities, primarily in the southeastern United States, for
       bulk-blending and/or warehousing.  Most of the potash and phosphate raw
<PAGE>

       materials used by these operations are supplied by the Company's mines
       and plants.


       The Products

           Shipments of Rainbow (Registered Trademark) and Super Rainbow
       (Registered Trademark) (premium high-value crop nutrients) accounted
       for about 46 percent of the Company's total 1994 high-value crop
       nutrient sales.  These crop nutrients are formulated for specific kinds
       of crops, soils, and soil conditions, and, in addition to the three
       major plant nutrients, may contain as many as seven secondary elements
       and micronutrients.

           The Rainbow Division also sells phosphate rock, concentrated
       phosphates, potash and nitrogen products for direct application to the
       soil.


       The Market

           High-value crop nutrients are marketed in the United States and
       sold principally to independent dealers, distributors and farmers, with
       some sales made directly to other crop nutrient manufacturers.  Sales
       are largely concentrated in the spring planting season.  Weather has
       some impact on the timing and length of the planting season and can
       have a significant effect on high-value crop nutrient prices.
       High-value crop nutrient shipments in 1994 approximated 725,000 tons
       vs. 727,000 tons in 1993.

           The Company believes its share of the southeastern U.S. market, the
       market in which it operates, was about 15 percent in 1994.  The
       competition consists of many relatively small enterprises and other
       large high-value crop nutrient companies.



       Uranium Oxide
       -------------

           Phosphate rock is the source of uranium oxide, with the uranium
       content varying from deposit to deposit.  When central Florida
       phosphate rock is converted into phosphoric acid, there is about a
       pound of uranium oxide in each ton of the acid (P2O5 equivalent).

           Uranium oxide production facilities are located in Florida and
       Louisiana.  IMC-Agrico owns three plants in central Florida (all of
       which are temporarily idle) for the extraction and processing of
       uranium oxide as a by-product of phosphoric acid.  Two of these plants
       are primary recovery units and the third is a final processing
       refinery.

           One of the primary recovery units and the final processing refinery
       adjoin IMC-Agrico's New Wales concentrated phosphate plant.  The
       primary recovery unit produced no uranium oxide in 1994 and a minimum
       amount of uranium oxide in 1993.  When operational, uranium oxide is
       extracted from phosphoric acid manufactured at the New Wales plant.

           Another primary recovery unit is located adjacent to a concentrated
       phosphate plant owned and operated by a subsidiary of CF Industries
       (CF), located in Plant City, Florida.  This facility extracts uranium
<PAGE>

       oxide from CF's phosphoric acid production at that plant.  The Company
       had previously extracted and purchased CF's uranium oxide under a
       contract that ran through December 31, 1992.  However, due to the
       expiration of its long-term sales contracts at June 30, 1992 and the
       depressed market price of uranium oxide at that time, the Company
       reached an agreement with CF to suspend production six months early.

           Prior to June 30, 1992, uranium oxide was sold under seven
       contracts which supplied uranium oxide to nuclear power plants.
       Shipments under these contracts were delivered at prices which were
       substantially above market price.  Since the expiration of these
       contracts, the Company has been unable to secure contracts with pricing
       terms favorable enough, in relationship to production cost, to warrant
       continued operation of the uranium oxide plants.  Therefore, in
       addition to the agreement with CF to suspend production at Plant City,
       uranium oxide production at New Wales was suspended late in calendar
       1992 after raw material inventories were depleted and work-in-process
       was finished.  The suspension of production at New Wales and Plant City
       is expected to be temporary, and production will resume when future
       uranium oxide prices warrant renewed operation.

           In addition, the Company had previously owned a primary recovery
       unit located adjacent to a concentrated phosphate facility owned and
       operated by a subsidiary of CF in Bartow, Florida.  In 1989, a
       permanent shutdown of the facility was negotiated for economic reasons
       (it had not operated since July 1985) at which time title to part of
       this facility was transferred to CF.  In 1994, the Bartow recovery unit
       was dismantled.

           IMC-Agrico also owns and operates uranium oxide recovery and
       processing facilities which are located adjacent to its Uncle Sam and
       Faustina concentrated phosphate plants in Louisiana.  In 1994, these
       production facilities recovered 974,359 pounds of uranium oxide from
       phosphoric acid produced at these facilities.

           Under a joint venture agreement with Denison Mines Ltd. (Denison),
       IMC-Agrico is responsible for the production of uranium oxide at Uncle
       Sam and Faustina, and Denison is responsible for marketing the uranium
       oxide produced under long-term contracts through calendar 1995.  These
       contracts currently yield prices significantly above spot market
       prices.



       Ammonia
       -------

           IMC-Agrico produces ammonia at its Faustina plant located at
       Donaldsonville, Louisiana.  Production from the Faustina plant, which
       has an estimated annual capacity of 530,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia,
       is primarily used internally to produce urea, DAP and MAP.

           Until early 1992, the Company produced anhydrous ammonia at two
       plants located in Sterlington, Louisiana.  This ammonia facility was
       sold to Koch Industries, Inc. in February 1992.  In connection with the
       sale of this facility, the Company entered into contracts to meet its
       ammonia requirements.



       Sulphur and Oil & Natural Gas
<PAGE>

       -----------------------------

           See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
       Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of the status of
       the Company's sulphur and oil & natural gas ventures.



       INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
       ------------------------

           Foreign operations and investments are subject to risks customarily
       encountered in such foreign operations and investments, including
       fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls,
       expropriation and other economic, political and regulatory policies of
       local governments, and laws and policies of the United States affecting
       foreign trade and investment.

           Internationally, the Company's products are sold primarily through
       one Canadian and three U.S. export associations.  Due to economic and
       political factors, customers can change dramatically from year to year.
       In 1994, principal customer countries included the People's Republic of
       China, India, Japan, Korea, Australia and several Latin American and
       European countries.  The Company maintains an international marketing
       sales force which works with and provides a variety of agronomic and
       technical services to foreign customers including government agencies
       to help improve economic yields and agricultural technology.  For
       further information concerning the Company's foreign operations and
       business, see the following captions in Item 1:

       WORKING CAPITAL
       ---------------

           The working capital requirements for inventory and receivables of
       the Company are not materially affected by seasonal or other factors
       except for its high-value crop nutrient business.  Sales of that
       product are largely concentrated in the spring season, requiring a
       higher than average level of inventory to meet anticipated customer
       demand for the product.

           The Company does not extend long-term credit to customers.  The
       Company believes this non-extension of credit as well as its working
       capital requirements are not materially different from the credit
       policies and working capital requirements of its competitors.



       RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND MALLINCKRODT GROUP INC.
       ------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>



           The Company was at one time a wholly-owned subsidiary of
       Mallinckrodt Group Inc.  As a result of a public offering of the
       Company's common stock by Mallinckrodt Group Inc. and stock purchases
       by the Company, Mallinckrodt Group Inc.'s ownership interest in the
       Company was reduced to approximately 4,000,000 shares at the end of
       fiscal year 1991, which shares were substantially all purchased by the
       Company in July 1991.

           Two Mallinckrodt Group Inc. officers were on the Company's Board of
       Directors at the beginning of fiscal year 1992, but they were replaced
       on July 2, 1991, when the aforementioned stock purchase took place.

           On April 22, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors elected a new
       board member who, at June 30, 1994, was also a member of the Board of
       Directors for Mallinckrodt Group Inc.

           The Company continues to have contractual relationships with
       Mallinckrodt Group Inc., which originated at the time the Company was a
       subsidiary of Mallinckrodt Group Inc.  These include arrangements under
       which the Company operates an animal feed-grade phosphate facility,
       that is located at IMC-Agrico's New Wales concentrated phosphate
       complex, for Mallinckrodt and supplies utilities and the requirements
       of anhydrous ammonia and phosphate rock for the facility.  The Company
       also operates for Mallinckrodt Group Inc. a mine to obtain limestone
       for use in Mallinckrodt's animal feed plant.  Each company has agreed
       to indemnify the other against certain liabilities.

           See "Product Line Information - Concentrated Phosphates - Animal
       Feed Ingredients Agreements" for discussion of various supply
       agreements with Mallinckrodt Group Inc.

           Other agreements between Mallinckrodt Group Inc. and the Company
       provide for a tax sharing arrangement relating in part to the period
       from July 1, 1987 to February 2, 1988 when the Company was included in
       Mallinckrodt Group Inc.'s consolidated income tax returns.  Also, if a
       subsequent adjustment by any taxing authority were to result in an
       increase in the tax liability of Mallinckrodt Group Inc. or the Company
       or any of their domestic or foreign subsidiaries and result in a
       corresponding reduction in the tax liability of the other party, then
       an equitable reimbursement by the benefited party will be paid to the
       other party.



       OTHER ACTIVITIES
       ----------------

       Environmental Matters
       ---------------------

           The Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal and
       local governments in the United States and Canada.  Although
       significant capital expenditures, as noted below, as well as operating
       costs, have been incurred and will continue to be incurred on account
       of these laws and regulations, the Company does not believe they have
       had or will have a material adverse effect on its business.  However,
       the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or
       regulations.
<PAGE>

           Most of the Company's environmental capital expenditures are in
       response to provisions of the United States Clean Air Act, the United
       States Water Pollution Control Act, the United States Resource
       Conservation and Recovery Act, and the land use, air, and water
       protection statutes and regulations of the various localities, states,
       and Canadian provinces in which the Company operates.

           Environmental capital expenditures were primarily related to air
       emission control, wastewater purification, and solid waste disposal.
       These expenditures totaled approximately $22 million in 1994.  The
       Company expects that environmental capital expenditures will average
       between $15 million and $25 million per year over the next two years.

           Land reclamation expenditures to remediate previously mined-out
       areas totaled $10 million in 1994.  IMC-Agrico estimates such
       expenditures will total approximately $14 million in 1995.

           The Company is the subject from time to time of investigations
       relating to enforcement of various federal, state and provincial laws
       and regulations by environmental authorities relating to properties the
       Company owns or has owned and the disposal of wastes.  Although there
       can be no assurance in this regard, the Company believes that none of
       the current investigations, other than those described below,
       individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on
       the Company.

           In connection with the development order received from Polk County,
       Florida, authorities in July 1990 for the New Wales gypsum stack
       expansion at the Company's New Wales concentrated phosphate facility,
       the Company agreed to sample groundwater through monitoring wells on a
       quarterly basis.  Under the terms of the development order, if the
       samples indicated groundwater contamination in excess of specified
       levels, the Company would have two years to take the cooling pond
       relating to the gypsum stack out of service.

          Beginning in July 1992, groundwater samples taken at New Wales
       indicated substantially elevated levels of sulphate concentrations, a
       non-toxic contaminant, above permitted levels.  The Company immediately
       began an investigation and believed, based on available information and
       the advice of outside experts, that the likely sources of contamination
       were one or more of the 12 former recharge wells located within the
       cooling pond.  By the end of September 1993, all of the recharge wells
       had been located and plugged.  The aggregate cost of locating and
       plugging the 12 recharge wells was approximately $2.3 million.
       Pursuant to an amended development order and related action plan, which
       was approved by the Central Florida Regional Planning Council (the
       CFRPC) and by Polk County authorities, (i) the Company had until April
       30, 1994 to locate and plug the 12 recharge wells and has until October
       30, 1994 for levels of contamination to return to permitted levels, and
       (ii) if the October 30, 1994 deadline is not met, the Company will have
       until September 1997 to obtain permits for and to accomplish the lining
       or relocation of the cooling pond.  The cost of such lining or
       relocation, if necessary, is currently estimated to be between $35
       million and $68 million, with the bulk of any such expenditures
       expected to take place in 1996 and 1997.  Test results show that the
       levels of contamination slowly declined through June 1994 but did not
       reach permitted levels.  If the permitted levels are not reached by
       October 30, 1994 but the trend has continued downward, the Company
       would likely seek from the CFRPC and the Polk County authorities an
       extension of the deadline, although there can be no assurance that such
       extension would be granted.

          On June 27, 1994, workers at IMC-Agrico Company's New Wales
       concentrated phosphate production facility discovered a large hole
       while performing a routine inspection of the top of the north
       phosphogypsum storage stack.  This stack has been used mainly for
       process water storage only since the new south expansion area was
       completed in mid-1993.  The hole, more than 100 feet in diameter and
       approximately 185 feet deep, is believed to have been caused by a
       sinkhole that opened beneath the stack.

          Shortly after the discovery, the Florida Department of Environmental
       Protection (DEP) was notified.  The primary concern at the time was
       that the sinkhole may have allowed process water contained in and on
       the phosphogypsum stack to flow down into the underlying aquifers and
       contaminate drinking water supplies.

          Test results from monitoring wells have documented that water in the
       Floridan aquifer directly below the sinkhole has been impacted by the
       sinkhole and elevated levels of phosphate, sodium sulfate, and total
       dissolved solids have been indicated.  At the maximum levels predicted
       that these parameters will reach, there is no concern for health
       effects.  Tests are also being conducted to assure there are no
       elevated levels of any other parameters which would cause a health
       concern.  Furthermore, it has been concluded that the pumping action of
       the New Wales production wells have caused impacts from the sinkhole to
       be contained on the plant site to date.

          Holes have been drilled at an angle into the area surrounding the
       sinkhole to conduct geological testing and obtain core samples to
       determine the size and shape of the subsurface cavity.  Once the
       subsurface cavity is identified, the Partnership plans to pump a
       grouting material, possibly concrete, (subject to DEP approval) into
       the sinkhole to prevent a further collapse and contamination of the
       Floridan aquifer.  The Company has recorded a charge of $1.9 million to
       cover the cost of drilling and grouting but no assurance can be given
       that such expenditures will be adequate to contain the contamination.

          IMCF believes that the cooling pond recharge wells discussed above
       and the phosphogypsum sinkhole activity are distinct problems that have
       resulted in similar groundwater impacts and that successful containment
       of the sinkhole through grout injection will prevent further
       contamination.  The Company expects a resumption of the downward trend
       of contamination levels to occur upon successful completion of the
       grouting, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

          Pursuant to the agreement for the formation of the Partnership
       discussed above, any expenditures relating to the CFRPC development
       order would be a liability retained by IMCF, provided that the first $5
       million aggregate amount of expenditures incurred subsequent to the
       formation of the Partnership that related to this contamination or
       certain other environmental liabilities identified in the agreement for
       the formation of the Partnership would be a liability assumed by the
       Partnership.

           The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) conducted tests
       which indicated there may be herbicide and nitrate contamination of
       soil at a former company-owned farm center at Edmund, Wisconsin, and of
       drinking water wells near the farm center.  No connection between the
       contamination of the wells and the operations at the former
       company-owned farm center has been established.  The Company cleaned
       the soil at the site to the satisfaction of the DNR.  The Company is
<PAGE>

       currently conducting discussions with the DNR to determine the extent
       to which groundwater remediation may be required.  The magnitude of any
       liability the Company may have has not been determined, but it is not
       expected to be material to the Company.

           The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has investigated the
       Company's operations in Florida concerning possible exceedences of
       waste water discharge levels and applicable permits.  The Company and
       EPA have tentatively agreed to a settlement under which the Company
       will pay $835,000 and undertake supplementary environmental projects of
       approximately $265,000.  Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution
       Agreement, all liabilities incurred in connection with this matter were
       retained by the Company and not transferred to the Partnership.

           The Company was recently notified by the EPA that it is alleged to
       be a potentially responsible party for pollution of a site in
       Woodstock, Illinois, designated to be on the U.S. Superfund list.  The
       Company has not had the opportunity to investigate the basis, if any,
       for this allegation.


       Employees
       ---------

           The Company had approximately 6,300 employees at June 30, 1994.
       The work force was comprised of 1,850 salaried, 4,400 hourly, and 50
       temporary or part-time employees.


       Labor Relations
       ---------------

           The Company has 11 collective bargaining agreements with three
       international unions or their affiliated local chapters.  Four
       agreements covering 35 percent of the hourly work force were negotiated
       during calendar 1993.  Resulting wage and benefit increases were
       consistent with competitive industry and community patterns.  Three
       agreements covering 43 percent of the hourly workers will expire or are
       subject to renegotiation in calendar 1994.  The Company has not
       experienced a significant work stoppage in recent years and considers
       its employee relations to be good.

           In connection with the Partnership, contract negotiations took
       place between the Company, IMC-Agrico and the International Chemical
       Workers Union.  As a result, on June 2, 1994, IMC-Agrico employees at
       the phosphate rock mineral operations reached their first labor
       agreement.



       Item 2.   Properties.

           Information regarding the plant and properties of the Company is
       included in Item 1, ``
                            Business.''



       Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.

           Pursuant to certain agreements between the Company and Mallinckrodt
       Group Inc., the Company has agreed to indemnify Mallinckrodt Group Inc.
<PAGE>

       against any liability or costs attributable to, among other things,
       litigation involving the crop nutrient business, whether or not the
       events which give rise to the litigation predated July 1, 1987.

           In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is and will
       from time to time be involved in routine litigation.  Except for the
       matters discussed below, none of the litigation pending or known to be
       threatened at this time is regarded by the Company as potentially
       material.


       Sterlington Litigation
       ----------------------

           In May 1991, an explosion occurred at a nitroparaffins plant (the
       NP Plant) in Sterlington, Louisiana, owned by Angus Chemical Company
       (Angus) and operated by IMCF pursuant to a management agreement with
       Angus.  Approximately 240 personal injury lawsuits arising out of this
       explosion remain unresolved in Louisiana courts.  A Louisiana state
       appellate court reversed the trial judges previous ruling which had
       denied certification of a class or classes regarding these lawsuits.
       The Company has established a reserve to cover the estimated cost of
       resolving the remaining Louisiana litigation.  Such reserve was
       calculated based upon the advice of the Company's risk management
       department, its broker's claims department and outside counsel.  Such
       advice was based upon Angus' experience settling over 1,600 Louisiana
       bodily injury and/or property damage claims, the nature of the injuries
       alleged by non-IMCF employees, the advice that, under Louisiana law,
       workers compensation should be the exclusive remedy available to
       injured IMCF employees and the experience of Louisiana counsel and of
       Louisiana claims adjusters in settling claims in the judicial district
       in which the claims are pending.

           The Company is pursuing additional recoveries from its insurance
       carriers relating to lawsuits arising out of the explosion.  The
       Company has received funds from three of its excess general liability
       insurers and has reached a complete settlement with one of them and a
       partial settlement with another.  The third of these insurers has paid
       its policy limits, but the Company has filed a lawsuit in Texas
       attempting to recover additional amounts.  The Company to date has
       received $85.7 million from these three insurers and, under the terms
       of the partial settlement, is seeking to recover additional amounts in
       arbitration from one excess insurer.  In that arbitration, the insurer
       has filed a counterclaim which seeks the return of the $15 million paid
       to the Company by that insurer.

           In 1993, Angus filed, but has not yet served, a lawsuit in
       Louisiana against the Company and two of its excess liability insurers
       seeking damages in addition to those paid in the Sterlington litigation
       discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
       Company has been informed by counsel to Angus that the suit seeks
       damages allegedly related to (i) direct action claims against two of
       the Company's insurers, with one of which there is an agreement which
       that insurer might assert requires the Company to indemnify such
       insurer, (ii) third party claims against Angus, and (iii) sums already
       paid by Angus to third parties.  The Company believes that there are
       substantial defenses to the direct action claims against its insurers
       and the claims for sums already paid by Angus to third parties, and
       that, in any event, the Company's exposure, if any, for such direct
       action claims is approximately $30 million.
<PAGE>

           Later in 1993 the Company filed a lawsuit in Texas against Angus
       seeking a court determination that the settlement and final judgment
       (discussed in Note 4) entered in April of 1993 between and among the
       Company, Angus and its property insurer disposed of the Angus claims
       described in items (i) and (iii) above.  Angus filed a counterclaim
       seeking reimbursement for sums already paid by Angus to third parties.
       This lawsuit is still in the discovery phase, with trial of a portion
       of the case scheduled for October of 1994 and the remaining portion, if
       necessary, scheduled for February of 1995.  The trial judge has ruled
       that the terms of the April 1, 1993 settlement agreement with Angus do
       not bar Angus from bringing direct action claims in Louisiana against
       the Company's insurers, but did not rule as to whether such claims have
       any merit under Louisiana law.  The judge also ruled that the terms of
       the same settlement agreement do not bar Angus from making claims
       against the Company for sums already paid to third parties by Angus.
       Angus' responses to discovery requests indicate that the Company's
       exposure for sums already paid to third parties is approximately $10
       million.  Neither of the rulings addressed the question of whether the
       final judgment acts as a bar to direct action claims by Angus or claims
       by Angus for sums paid to third parties.  The Company intends to
       vigorously litigate these matters; however, given that the Texas
       lawsuit is in its early stages and discovery is not complete, the
       Louisiana lawsuit has not been served, and the uncertainties inherent
       in litigation, no assurances can be given that the Company will prevail
       in these matters.


       Potash Antitrust Litigation
       ---------------------------

           The Company has been named as a defendant, along with other
       Canadian and U.S. potash producers, in lawsuits filed in federal court
       in Minnesota and state court in California and Illinois.  The
       plaintiffs are purchasers of potash who allege a price fixing
       conspiracy among North American potash producers beginning in 1987 and
       continuing until the filing of the lawsuits.  Discovery is being
       conducted with respect to the limited question of whether the court
       should certify a class of potash purchasers in the Minnesota
       litigation.  Cases filed in California and Illinois are still at an
       early stage pending further proceedings concerning coordination of the
       cases and other preliminary issues.  While the Company believes that
       the allegations in the complaints are without merit, until discovery
       has been completed it is unable to evaluate possible defenses or to
       make a reliable determination as to potential liability exposure, if
       any.

           The Company has also received a U.S. grand jury subpoena seeking
       information related to the sale of potash in the United States from
       1986 to the present.  The Company is cooperating with the government
       and is assembling the information needed to comply with the subpoena.
       As in the civil litigation described above, while the Company does not
       believe that violations of the antitrust laws have occurred, the
       Company is unable to predict the outcome of the government
       investigation or make a reliable determination as to potential
       exposure, if any.


       Environmental Proceedings

           Information regarding environmental proceedings is included in Item
       1, "Business - Other Activities."



       Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

           There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders,
       through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three
       months ended June 30, 1994.



       EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

       James D. Speir
       --------------
       Age 54.  Executive Vice President, Operations; Senior Vice President of
       the Company from 1987 until 1992.

           On August 2, 1994, the Company announced the following senior
       management changes which were effective immediately:
<PAGE>

           Wendell F. Bueche was elected Chairman of the Board and remains
       Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Bueche assumed the
       chairmanship from Billie B. Turner, who was named Chairman Emeritus and

           The Company's common stock is traded on the New York and Chicago
       Stock Exchanges under the symbol IFL.  As of August 31, 1994, the
       Company had 29,471,036 shares of common stock outstanding, excluding
       2,770,259 treasury shares.  Common stock prices are from the composite
       tape for New York Stock Exchange issues as reported in The Wall Street
       Journal.
<PAGE>

           Pursuant to a Shareholders Rights Plan adopted by the Company in
       June 1989, a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right)
       for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company was issued on
       July 12, 1989, to shareholders of record on that date.  Under certain
       conditions, each Right may be exercised to purchase one one-hundredth
       of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, Series C, par value $1.00 per
       share, at a price of $150.  This preferred stock is designed to
       participate in dividends and vote on essentially equivalent terms with
       a whole share of common stock.  The Rights become exercisable apart
       from the common stock only if a person or group acquires 20 percent or
       more of the common stock or makes a tender offer for 20 percent or more
       of the outstanding common stock.  However, the Rights do not become
       exercisable if a person or group becomes the owner of 20 percent or
       more of the common stock as a result of the purchase of common stock by
       the Company to reduce the number of shares outstanding and increase the
       proportionate number of shares owned by such person or group to 20
       percent or more, unless such person or group subsequently becomes the
       owner of any additional shares of the common stock.  In addition, upon
       the acquisition by a person or group of 20 percent or more of the
       common stock, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the
       then-current exercise price of the Right, a number of shares of common
       stock having a market value at that time of twice the exercise price.
       The Rights may be redeemed at a price of $.01 per Right under certain
       circumstances prior to their expiration on June 21, 1999.  No event
       during 1994 made the Rights exercisable.

           As of August 31, 1994, the number of registered holders of common
       stock as reported by the Company's registrar was 272.  However, an
       indeterminable number of shareholders beneficially own shares of the
       Company's common stock through investment funds and brokers.

           In April 1993, the Company's Board of Directors voted to suspend
       cash dividend payments on its common stock.  This action was taken in
       light of certain financial demands resulting from a then recent
       litigation settlement and a continued weakness in crop nutrient prices.

           The Company's debt instruments contain provisions which limit the
       Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock.  The most
       restrictive of these provisions limit the amount of dividends payable
       by the Company to 25 percent of the cumulative net income of the
       Company earned subsequent to June 30, 1993.  As a result, for the year
       ended June 30, 1994, the Company was precluded from paying cash
       dividends.  At such time as the Company is no longer precluded from
       paying cash dividends, the payment of such dividends will depend on the
       Company's capital requirements, earnings, financial condition and such
       other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant at that time.
       See Note 10 - Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of
       Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and
       Liquidity for information on dividend restrictions.

       Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
              Results of Operations.


                                RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

       1994 vs. 1993
       -------------

          IMC Fertilizer's results of operations for the year ended June 30,
       1994 showed significant improvement over the previous year.  In fiscal
       1994, the Company incurred a net loss of $28.8 million, or $1.14 per
       share.  This compared to a net loss of $167.1 million. or $7.57 per
       share, a year ago.

          In 1994, the loss included an extraordinary charge of $25.2 million,
       or $1.00 per share, related to the early extinguishment of debt, a
       charge of $12.4 million, or $.49 per share, for the write-down of an
       oil and gas investment, and a charge of $4.1 million, or $.16 per
       share, for an adjustment to the Company's deferred tax liability for
       the effect of changes in U.S. corporate tax rates.  Partially
       offsetting these charges was a gain of $1.9 million, or $.07 per share,
       resulting from the sale by IMC-Agrico Company of its Florida cattle
       ranch (while still retaining the rights to phosphate rock reserves
       located on the property).  See Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements for further discussion of these non-recurring items.

          In 1993, the loss included a one-time charge of $47.1 million, or
       $2.13 per share, for the cumulative effect on prior years of a change
       in accounting for postretirement benefits as a result of the adoption
       of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, as of
       July 1, 1992, a charge of $109.1 million, or $4.94 per share, from the
       settlement of litigation resulting from an explosion at a Sterlington,
       Louisiana, nitroparaffins plant managed by the Company, and a charge of
       $11.4 million, or $.52 per share, related to the settlement of an
       insurance claim receivable resulting from a water inflow at the
       Company's potash mines in Canada.  See Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements for further discussion of these non-recurring items.
<PAGE>

          Excluding the non-recurring items described above, the Company had
       net earnings in 1994 of $11.0 million, or $.44 per share, compared to
       1993 earnings of $.5 million, or $.02 per share.

          IMC-Agrico, a joint venture partnership between the Company and FRP,
       began operations July 1, 1993 and is consolidated for financial
       reporting purposes.  Comparisons between the years ended June 30, 1994
       and 1993 have been made, where applicable, on a pro forma basis
       assuming the Partnership had begun operations on July 1, 1992.

          Net sales for 1994 were $1,441.5 million, compared to $897.1 million
       in 1993.  On a pro forma basis, 1993 sales would have been $1,470.3
       million.  The sales decline in 1994 as compared to 1993 on a pro forma
       basis reflected the Company's decision to reduce production at its
       concentrated phosphate production facilities consistent with its policy
       to better match production with demand.  Product line sales information
       may be found on page 2 of this annual report.

           Gross margins increased $82.7 million from 1993.  On a pro forma
       basis, gross margins would have increased $90.1 million, or 77 percent,
       primarily due to higher margins for concentrated phosphates.

          Concentrated phosphate margins increased primarily due to higher
       prices throughout the year. DAP sales realizations were, at year end,
       50 percent higher than last year as DAP prices rose from a 20-year low
       of $100 per ton.  Other related concentrated phosphate products showed
       similar price improvements.  Several factors contributed to this rise
       in prices.  Domestic crop nutrient consumption increased 4 percent as
       farmers sought to recover from 1993's generally poor harvest due
       primarily to flooding in the Midwest.  Internationally, China, a major
       concentrated phosphate customer, increased crop nutrient imports after
       a reduction in exchange rate subsidies resulted in a 50 percent drop in
       U.S. DAP imports in 1993.  The Former Soviet Union reduced its exports
       of crop nutrient products dramatically over 1993 when, in an attempt to
       increase foreign exchange and hard currency reserves, it sold
       concentrated phosphates at below market price levels.  Unit production
       costs were lower when compared to last year, in spite of sharply higher
       ammonia prices, primarily due to lower raw material costs for sulphur.

          Potash margins remain largely unchanged as favorable production
       costs ($11 million), primarily from lower water inflow control
       spending, were almost totally offset by a 9 percent decrease in prices
       ($9 million) and lower sales volume ($1 million).  Sulphur production
       at Main Pass continued to exceed design capacity (5,500 tons per day)
       and is now averaging 6,250 tons per day.

          Selling, general and administrative costs increased $5.6 million
       primarily resulting from higher legal expenses and increased sales
       commissions.

          Interest charges were $36.2 million higher than last year as a
       result of higher average debt balances and lower capitalized interest
       as the Company's Main Pass sulphur mine became operational in 1994.

          The Company's effective tax rate of 146.2 percent for 1994 reflected
       the impact of foreign earnings (at higher foreign tax rates) and the
       inclusion of non-recurring items which impacted domestic operating
       results for 1994.  If such non-recurring items (described above) were
       excluded, the effective tax rate would have been 53.9 percent.  See
       Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
       discussion of income taxes.
<PAGE>



       1993 vs. 1992
       -------------

           IMC Fertilizer incurred a net loss of $167.1 million, or $7.57 per
       share, in 1993.  This compares to a 1992 net loss of $74.6 million, or
       $3.38 per share.  Included in 1993 results was a one-time charge of
       $47.1 million, or $2.13 per share, for the cumulative effect on prior
       years of a change in accounting for postretirement benefits as a result
       of the adoption of SFAS No. 106, as of July 1, 1992.  1992 results
       included a one-time charge of $165.5 million, or $7.50 per share, for
       the cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting for
       income taxes as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 109, as of July 1,
       1991.

           Net sales in 1993 were $897.1 million, a 15 percent decrease from
       1992 when net sales were $1.059 billion.  The Company continued to
       experience severe price declines and decreased demand for its products
       throughout the year, particularly concentrated phosphates where prices
       fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due primarily to economic and
       political uncertainties in key foreign markets, especially China and
       India.

           Fiscal 1993 results also included a pre-tax charge of $169.1
       million related to the settlement of litigation resulting from the May
       1991 explosion at a Sterlington, Louisiana, nitroparaffins plant owned
       by Angus but operated by the Company.  See Note 4 of Notes to
       Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this
       matter.

           Included in 1993 results was a pre-tax charge of $32.4 million
       related to the settlement of a dispute over an insurance claim
       receivable resulting from a water inflow at the Company's potash mines
       in Canada and a gain of $8.1 million from the resolution of a contract
       dispute with a major uranium oxide customer.  In 1992, operating
       results included a pre-tax gain of $34.2 million from the sale of the
       Company's ammonia production facility at Sterlington, Louisiana, and a
       charge of $5.3 million from the temporary shutdown and mothballing of
       the Company's uranium production facilities.  These items are included
       in the Consolidated Statement of Operations under "Other operating
       income and expense, net."

           Gross margins decreased $105 million from a year ago, primarily due
       to lower margins for concentrated phosphates ($53 million), phosphate
       rock ($19 million), and potash ($4 million).  Also affecting margins
       was the impact of the Company's decision to sell its ammonia business
       and, after the sales contracts which supported the facilities expired,
       to temporarily shut down its uranium oxide production facilities.  This
       resulted in lost margins for ammonia and uranium of $7 million and $21
       million, respectively.

           Concentrated phosphate margins were lower as a result of a decrease
       in prices ($75 million) as prices plummeted during the year.  Partially
       offsetting this decrease were lower production costs ($17 million) and
       increased shipping volume ($5 million).  Phosphate rock margins
       decreased primarily due to lower shipping volume ($12 million) and
       higher production costs ($7 million).  Potash margins were lower as a
       result of a decrease in prices ($6 million), partially offset by lower
       production costs ($2 million).
<PAGE>

           Administrative costs decreased $8 million principally as a result
       of reduced management compensation awards in 1993 ($4 million) and
       lower rent expense due to equipment leases which were cancelled and
       bought out in 1992 ($3 million).

           See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
       information on income taxes.

       Supply Contracts
       ----------------

          The Company and the Partnership purchase sulphur and ammonia
       (beginning in 1992 after the sale of the Company's ammonia production
       facility) from third parties and sell phosphate rock and concentrated
       phosphates to third parties under contracts extending in some cases for
       multiple years.  Purchases and sales under these contracts are
       generally at prevailing market prices, except for certain phosphate
       rock sales which are at prices based on the Partnership's cost of
       production.

          In March 1994, the Partnership and U.S. Agri-Chemicals (USAC)
       entered into an agreement in which the Partnership agreed to mine
       certain phosphate rock reserves owned by USAC and process such reserves
       for its own use.  In return, the Partnership agreed to supply all of
       USAC's internal phosphate rock requirements (1.3 to 2.0 million tons
       per year) at its Fort Meade, Florida, concentrated phosphate facility
       beginning October 1, 1994 at a price based on the Partnership's cost of
       production.  This agreement will end on September 30, 2004, at which
       time it may be renewed for an additional five years.


                           CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

          The Company's primary sources of liquidity are provided by operating
       activities and financing activities.  Information on the Company's
       consolidated cash flows for the past three years may be found on the
       Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 37 of this annual report.

          There were no significant foreign exchange contracts, interest rate
       contracts or any other derivative type contracts entered into by the
       Company in 1994.

          Working capital at June 30, 1994 was $325 million compared with $195
       million at June 30, 1993.  The increase was due primarily to higher
       levels of cash and inventory resulting from the formation of a joint
       venture partnership described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
       Financial statements, partially offset by lower current debt maturities
       and the payment of a dividend owed to Mallinckrodt Group Inc.  The
       working capital ratio at June 30, 1994 was 2.6 to 1, up from 1.8 to 1 a
       year ago.

          The Company made great strides in reducing its leverage ratio as two
       public stock offerings (described below) were successfully completed,
       the proceeds of which were used to reduce outstanding debt.
       Consolidated indebtedness decreased to $689.2 million from $926.7
       million at June 30, 1993.  Correspondingly, the Company's ratio of
       indebtedness to total capitalization declined to 51.3 percent at June
       30, 1994, down significantly from 68.3 percent at June 30, 1993.

          In October 1993, the Company completed its purchase of $220 million
       principal amount of its 11.25 percent Notes which were originally
<PAGE>

       scheduled to be due in annual installments beginning in 1995.  These
       Notes were redeemed with the proceeds from the sale of $160 million of
       9.25 percent Senior Notes due 2000 and 3,450,000 shares of common stock
       previously held in treasury.

          In May 1994, the Company completed a public offering of 4,000,000
       shares of common stock previously held in treasury.  Net proceeds of
       this offering were used to purchase the Company's 8 percent Note and
       portions of its 9.25 percent Senior Notes due 2000, 10.125 percent
       Senior Notes due 2001, and 10.75 percent Senior Notes due 2003.

          The Company has an agreement with a group of banks to provide the
       Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Working
       Capital Facility) under which the Company may borrow up to $100 million
       until June 30, 1996.  At June 30, 1994, $29.6 million was drawn down in
       the form of letters of credit principally to support industrial revenue
       bonds and other debt and credit risk guarantees.  There were no other
       borrowings under the agreement at June 30, 1994.

          In February 1994, the Partnership entered into an agreement with a
       group of banks to provide it with a $75 million unsecured revolving
       credit facility (the Partnership Working Capital Facility).  At June
       30, 1994, $4.9 million was drawn down in the form of letters of credit.
       There were no other borrowings under this agreement at June 30, 1994.

          The Senior Notes and the Working Capital Facility contain provisions
       which restrict the Company's ability to make capital expenditures and
       dispose of assets, limit the payment of dividends or other
       distributions to stockholders, and limit the incurrence of additional
       indebtedness.  The Working Capital Facility also contains financial
       ratios and tests which must be met with respect to interest and fixed
       charge coverage, tangible net worth, working capital and debt to total
       capitalization.  In addition, the Partnership Working Capital Facility
       contains financial ratios and tests with respect to fixed charge,
       current ratio and minimum net Partners' capital requirements, and
       places limitations on indebtedness of the Partnership and restricts the
       ability of the Partnership to make cash distributions in excess of
       Distributable Cash (as defined).  The Company and the Partnership are
       currently in compliance with all of the covenants in the indentures and
       other agreements governing their indebtedness.

          In July 1994, IMC-Agrico entered into an option agreement with MCC
       to purchase 9,472 acres of land in Florida.  The Property, along with
       2,508 acres of land previously purchased from MCC (the Adjacent
       Property), contains approximately 87.5 million tons of phosphate rock
       reserves.  The option period began July 16, 1994 and will end January
       15, 1998.  During this time, IMC-Agrico may exercise its option to
       purchase the Property or it may continue to make annual payments
       ranging from $1.0 to $3.0 million to keep the option in effect.  If by
       the end of the option period IMC-Agrico exercises its option to
       purchase the Property, the purchase price will be financed by MCC over
       a six-year term at interest rates approximating IMC-Agrico's borrowing
       rate.  If at any time during the option period IMC-Agrico fails to make
       an option payment or fails to exercise its option by January 15, 1998,
       MCC has the right to sell the Property to IMC-Agrico for a specified
       amount.  If the option to purchase the Property is not exercised by
       IMC-Agrico and MCC does not exercise its right to sell the Property to
       IMC-Agrico, MCC has the right to purchase the Adjacent Property from

          The Company estimates that its capital expenditures for 1995 will
       total approximately $63 million (including $45 million by the
       Partnership).  The Company expects to finance these expenditures
       (including its portion of the Partnership's capital expenditures) from
       operations.  See "Other Matters" for a discussion of environmental
       capital expenditures.

          Since December 1985, the Company has experienced an inflow of water
       into one of its two interconnected potash mines in Saskatchewan,
       Canada.  As a result, the Company has suffered losses and has been
       forced to undertake substantial remedial efforts to stop the flooding.
       Remedial efforts are ongoing, with $25 million (Canadian) having been
       expended in 1994 and $29 million (Canadian) expected to be spent in
       1995.

          The Company has significantly reduced the water inflow since the
       initial discovery and has been able to meet all sales obligations and
       requirements from production at the mines.  Despite the relative
       success of such measures, there can be no assurance that the amounts
       required for remedial efforts in future years will not increase or that
       inflows will not increase to a level which would cause the Company to
       abandon the mine.  There can be no assurance that such action would not
       have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The long-term trend of
       the water inflow has caused the Company to consider alternatives to its
       current mining operations and studies are under way in this regard.
       Any solution to the water inflow situation at the mines could result in
       substantial capital expenditures.  The Company does not presently have
       in place, nor can it reasonably obtain, any insurance to cover damage
       to its underground potash operations.

          The Company does not consider the impact of inflation to be
       significant in the business in which it operates.

          In April 1993, the Company's Board of Directors voted to suspend
       cash dividend payments on its common stock.  This action was taken in
       light of certain financial demands resulting from a litigation
       settlement and a continued weakness in crop nutrient prices.

          The Company's debt instruments contain provisions which limit the
       Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock.  The most
       restrictive of these provisions limit the amount of dividends payable
       by the Company to 25 percent of cumulative net income of the Company
       earned subsequent to June 30, 1993.  As a result, for the year ended
       June 30, 1994, the Company was precluded from paying cash dividends.


                              JOINT VENTURE PARTNERSHIP

           On July 1, 1993, IMCF, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
       and FRP contributed their respective phosphate businesses, including
       the mining and sale of phosphate rock and the production, distribution
       and sale of concentrated phosphates, uranium oxide and related
       products, to a joint venture partnership in return for a 56.5 percent
       and 43.5 percent economic interest, respectively, in the Partnership,
       over the term of the Partnership.  The Partnership is governed by a
       Policy Committee which has equal representation from each company and
       is being operated by an affiliate of IMC.  The Partnership agreement
       contained a cash sharing arrangement under which distributable cash, as
       defined in the agreement, was shared at a ratio of 41.4 percent and
       58.6 percent in 1994 to IMCF and FRP, respectively, and will be
<PAGE>

       adjusted thereafter until 1998 when the sharing ratio will be fixed at
       59.4 percent and 40.6 percent to IMCF and FRP, respectively.


                       SULPHUR AND OIL & NATURAL GAS VENTURES

          The Company has a 25 percent interest in the Main Pass 299 sulphur
       mine located in the Gulf of Mexico.  At June 30, 1994, the underwater
       sulphur deposit contained an estimated 65.3 million long tons of
       recoverable sulphur, or 16.3 million long tons net to the Company,
       before royalties.  During the year, production gradually increased.  In
       December 1993, Main Pass achieved full design operating rates (5,500
       long tons per day or approximately two million long tons per year) and
       FRP, the joint venture operator, has since sustained production at or
       above that level.  The Company's share of sulphur produced is used to
       satisfy a portion of the Company's obligations to supply sulphur to the
       Partnership for the production of concentrated phosphates.

          Oil and gas reserves which are located in the same immediate area
       are also being developed.  At June 30, 1994, the field contained proved
       and probable reserves of 17.2 million barrels of oil and 1.9 billion
       cubic feet of natural gas.  All gas production is consumed internally
       in heating water for extraction of sulphur.


                                    OTHER MATTERS

           The Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal and
       local governments in the United States and Canada.  Although
       significant capital expenditures, as well as operating costs, have been
       incurred and will continue to be incurred on account of these laws and
       regulations, the Company does not believe they have had or will have a
       material adverse effect on its business.  However, the Company cannot
       predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations.

          In connection with the development order received from Polk County,
       Florida, authorities in July 1990 for the New Wales gypsum stack
       expansion at its New Wales concentrated phosphate facility, the Company
       agreed to sample groundwater through monitoring wells on a quarterly
       basis.  Under the terms of the development order, if the samples
       indicated groundwater contamination in excess of specified levels, the
       Company would have two years to take the cooling pond associated with
       the phosphogypsum stack out of service.

          Beginning in July 1992, groundwater samples taken at New Wales
       indicated substantially elevated levels of sulphate concentrations, a
       non-toxic contaminant, above permitted levels.  The Company immediately
       began an investigation and believed, based on available information and
       the advice of outside experts, that the likely sources of contamination
       were one or more of the 12 former recharge wells located within the
       cooling pond.  By the end of September 1993, all of the recharge wells
       had been located and plugged.  The aggregate cost of locating and
       plugging the 12 recharge wells was approximately $2.3 million.
       Pursuant to an amended development order and related action plan, which
       was approved by the CFRPC and by Polk County authorities, (i) the
       Company had until April 30, 1994 to locate and plug the 12 recharge
       wells and has until October 30, 1994 for levels of contamination to
       return to permitted levels, and (ii) if the October 30, 1994 deadline
       is not met, the Company will have until September 1997 to obtain
       permits for and to accomplish the lining or relocation of the cooling
       pond.  The cost of such lining or relocation, if necessary, is
<PAGE>

       currently estimated to be between $35 million and $68 million, with the
       bulk of any such expenditures expected to take place in 1996 and 1997.
       Test results show that the levels of contamination slowly declined
       through June 1994 but did not reach permitted levels.  If the permitted
       levels are not reached by October 30, 1994 but the trend has continued
       downward, the Company would likely seek from the CFRPC and the Polk
       County authorities an extension of the deadline, although there can be
       no assurance that such extension would be granted.

          On June 27, 1994, workers at IMC-Agrico Company's New Wales
       concentrated phosphate production facility discovered a large hole
       while performing a routine inspection of the top of the north
       phosphogypsum storage stack.  This stack has been used mainly for
       process water storage only since the new south expansion area was
       completed in mid-1993.  The hole, more than 100 feet in diameter and
       approximately 185 feet deep, is believed to have been caused by a
       sinkhole that opened beneath the stack.

          Shortly after the discovery, the Florida DEP was notified.  The
       primary concern at the time was that the sinkhole may have allowed
       process water contained in and on the phosphogypsum stack to flow down
       into the underlying aquifers and contaminate drinking water supplies.

          Test results from monitoring wells have documented that water in the
       Floridan aquifer directly below the sinkhole has been impacted by the
       sinkhole and elevated levels of phosphate, sodium sulfate, and total
       dissolved solids have been indicated.  At the maximum levels predicted
       that these parameters will reach, there is no concern for health
       effects.  Tests are also being conducted to assure there are no
       elevated levels of any other parameters which would cause a health
       concern.  Furthermore, it has been concluded that the pumping action of
       the New Wales production wells have caused impacts from the sinkhole to
       be contained on the plant site to date.

          Holes have been drilled at an angle into the area surrounding the
       sinkhole to conduct geological testing and obtain core samples to
       determine the size and shape of the subsurface cavity.  Once the
       subsurface cavity is identified, the Partnership plans to pump a
       grouting material, possibly concrete, (subject to DEP approval) into
       the sinkhole to prevent a further collapse and contamination of the
       Floridan aquifer.  The Company has recorded a charge of $1.9 million to
       cover the cost of drilling and grouting but no assurance can be given
       that such expenditures will be adequate to contain the contamination.

          IMCF believes that the cooling pond recharge wells discussed above
       and the phosphogypsum sinkhole activity are distinct problems that have
       resulted in similar groundwater impacts and that successful containment
       of the sinkhole through grout injection will prevent further
       contamination.  The Company expects a resumption of the downward trend
       of contamination levels to occur upon successful completion of the
       grouting, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

          Pursuant to the agreement for the formation of the Partnership
       discussed above, any expenditures relating to the CFRPC development
       order would be a liability retained by IMCF, provided that the first $5
       million aggregate amount of expenditures incurred subsequent to the
       formation of the Partnership that related to this contamination or
       certain other environmental liabilities identified in the agreement for
       the formation of the Partnership would be a liability assumed by the
       Partnership.

           Environmental capital expenditures were primarily related to air
       emission control, wastewater purification and solid waste disposal.
       These expenditures totaled approximately $22 million in 1994.  The
       Company expects that environmental capital expenditures will average
       between $15 million and $25 million per year over the next two years.

          Land reclamation expenditures to remediate previously mined-out
       areas totaled $10 million in 1994.  The Partnership estimates such
       expenditures to total approximately $14 million in 1995.

       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


       To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
       of IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc.

           We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IMC
       Fertilizer Group, Inc. as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related
       consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in
       stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended
       June 30, 1994.  Our audits also included the financial statement
       schedules listed in the index at Item 14(a).  These financial
       statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's
       management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
       financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

           We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
       auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
       the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
       statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
       examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
       disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
       assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
       by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
       presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
       for our opinion.

           In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
       above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
       financial position of IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc. at June 30, 1994 and
       1993, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows
       for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in
       conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our
       opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in
       relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present
       fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

           As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
       Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
       other than pensions in 1993.

       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
       (Dollars in millions except as otherwise indicated)


       1.  Business of the Company
           -----------------------
           IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc. (the Company), which operates in a
       single industry segment, is engaged in the mining, processing,
       production and sale of phosphate rock and potash, two basic crop
       nutrient materials, and in the production and sale of concentrated
       phosphates.  The Company also produces crop nutrient products for
       retail distribution and, through interests in two joint ventures,
       produces sulphur and oil & natural gas.


       2.  Accounting Policies
           -------------------

       Basis of Presentation
       ---------------------
           The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IMC
       Fertilizer Group, Inc. and all subsidiaries which are more than 50
       percent owned and controlled.  The consolidated financial statements
       also include the accounts of IMC-Agrico Company, a joint venture
       partnership with FRP formed on July 1, 1993.  The Company also
       consolidates its proportionate share of the assets and liabilities of
       the Company's sulphur venture, while its 25 percent investment in its
       oil and natural gas venture is accounted for using the equity method.
       All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated
       in consolidation.  Certain amounts in the consolidated financial
       statements for periods prior to June 30, 1994 have been reclassified to
       conform to the current presentation.  The Company's fiscal year ends
       June 30.

       Cash Equivalents
       ----------------
           The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity
       date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents
       which are reflected at their approximate fair value.  The effect of
       foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the total cash and cash
       equivalents balance was not significant.

       Inventories
       -----------
           Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (net
       realizable value).  Cost for substantially all inventories is
       determined on a cumulative annual average basis.

       Property, Plant and Equipment
       -----------------------------
           Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost.  Cost of
       significant assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the
       construction and development period.  Expenditures for replacements and
       improvements are capitalized; maintenance and repair expenditures are
       charged to operations when incurred.

           Depreciation and depletion expenses for mining and production
       operations, including mineral interests, are determined using the unit-
       of-production method based on estimates of recoverable reserves.  Other
       asset classes or groups are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line
<PAGE>

       basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:  buildings, 17 to
       50 years; machinery and equipment, five to 25 years.

       Accrued Reclamation Costs
       -------------------------
           The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which
       require the reclamation of certain mineral and related properties. The
       cost of restoring lands disturbed by mining and concentrated phosphate
       production activities includes earthmoving, dewatering and revegetation
       activities.  The Company accrues for reclamation costs in accordance
       with approved reclamation plans using estimates of future expenditures
       based on an inflation rate of 3 percent and discount rates
       approximating 7 percent at June 30, 1994.  As reclamation laws and
       regulations change, revisions to current estimates are made.

       Earnings Per Share
       ------------------
           Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of
       shares and equivalent shares outstanding.  Shares used in the
       calculations were 25,256,999, 22,082,053 and 22,068,090 shares for the
       years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Fully diluted
       earnings per share are not significantly different from primary
       earnings per share and, accordingly, are not presented.


       3.  Joint Venture Partnership
           -------------------------
           On July 1, 1993, IMCF and FRP entered into a joint venture
       partnership in which both companies contributed their respective
       phosphate businesses to create IMC-Agrico Company, a Delaware general
       partnership, in return for a 56.5 percent and a 43.5 percent economic
       interest, respectively, in the Partnership.  The estimated fair value
       of the assets contributed by the Company was $1.2 billion.  The
       activities of the Partnership, which is operated by the Company,
       include the mining and sale of phosphate rock, and the production,
       distribution and sale of concentrated phosphates, uranium oxide and
       related products.

           For financial reporting purposes, the acquisition of 56.5 percent
       of FRP's phosphate business net assets is being accounted for using the
       purchase method.  This transaction resulted in a deferred gain of $62.7
       million which is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
       as the related FRP assets are being used in operations, generally over
       20 years.  Other operating income and expense, net included $16.0
       million of such gain (including $12.7 million related to finished goods
       inventory) for the year ended June 30, 1994.  FRP's 43.5 percent
       interest in the Partnership has been reported as minority interest in
       consolidated joint venture on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet;
       and the earnings therefrom have been reported as minority interest in
       earnings of consolidated joint venture on the Company's Consolidated
       Statement of Operations.

           The Partnership makes cash distributions to each partner based on
       formulas and sharing ratios as defined in the Partnership agreement.
       For the year ended June 30, 1994, distributable cash generated by the
       Partnership totaled $257.9 million, of which $149.1 million was
       distributed to FRP, including $19.5 million to be distributed in August
       1994.
<PAGE>

           The following summary of the Company's Consolidated Statement of
       Operations for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 is presented for
       comparative purposes.  For the year ended June 30, 1993, unaudited pro
       forma Consolidated Statement of Operations data give effect to
       formation of the joint venture partnership as if the formation occurred
       on July 1, 1992.

       4.  Sterlington Litigation
           ----------------------
           Operating earnings for the year ended June 30, 1993 included a
       charge of $169.1 million, net of insurance recoveries and legal fees,
       which reflected settlement of a lawsuit with Angus for damages arising
       out of an explosion at a nitroparaffins plant in Sterlington,
       Louisiana.  The Company is defending other lawsuits for property damage
       and personal injury arising out of this explosion and has established a
       reserve to cover the estimated cost of resolving the remaining
       lawsuits.  See Note 19 for further discussion of this litigation.


       5.  Other Non-Recurring Operating Items
           -----------------------------------
           In addition to the amortization of the deferred gain discussed in
       Note 3, other operating income and expense, net, in 1994, included a
       gain of $5.5 million from the Partnership's sale of its Florida cattle
<PAGE>

       ranch.  In 1993, other operating income and expense, net included
       charges of $32.4 million from the settlement of a claim relating to
       losses arising out of a water inflow at one of the Company's potash
       mines in Canada and $3.0 million from the settlement of an
       environmental issue.  1993 also included a gain of $8.1 million from
       the resolution of a contract dispute with a major uranium oxide
       customer.  In 1992, other operating income and expense, net included a
       gain of $34.2 million from the Company's sale of its Sterlington,
       Louisiana, ammonia production facility and a charge of $5.3 million
       from the temporary shutdown and mothballing of the Company's uranium
       production facilities.


       6.  Write-Down of Investment in Oil and Gas Joint Venture
           -----------------------------------------------------
           The Company's investment in its oil and gas joint venture is
       subject to a quarterly ceiling limitation test based on a computed
       value of the Company's share of future net revenues from proved
       reserves using current prices.  Due to the low price of crude oil at
       December 31, 1993, the Company was required to reduce the carrying
       value of its investment in its oil and gas joint venture.  As a result,
       the Company recorded a charge of $20.3 million to reflect this
       reduction.

       10. Long-Term Debt
           --------------
           Long-term debt at June 30 consisted of the following:

                                                       1994         1993

           10.125% Senior notes, due 2001           $116.5       $135.0

           9.25% Senior notes, due 2000              111.2
           6.25% Convertible subordinated notes,
            due 2001                                 115.0        115.0
           9.45% Senior debentures, due 2011         100.0        100.0
           7.525% Industrial revenue bonds,

           8% Note, due in quarterly installments                  80.0

                                                    ------       ------
                                                    $688.1       $893.4
                                                    ======       ======

          On June 30,1994, the estimated fair value of long-term debt
       described above was approximately the same as the carrying amount of
       such debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The fair value was
       calculated in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 107,
       ``
        Disclosures About the Fair Value of Financial Instruments,'' and was
       estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently
       available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms and
       remaining maturities.

          In June 1993, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of
       banks to provide the Company with an unsecured revolving credit
       facility (the Working Capital Facility) under which the Company may
<PAGE>

       borrow up to $100 million for general corporate purposes until June 30,
       1996.  Borrowings under the Working Capital Facility are limited to $25
       million during a specified period in any year and bear interest at
       rates based on a base rate, a three-month certificate of deposit rate
       or a Federal Funds rate.  There is a 1/2 percent commitment fee on the
       unused portion of the credit line.  At June 30, 1994, $29.6 million was
       drawn down in the form of standby letters of credit principally to
       support the industrial revenue bonds and other debt and credit risk
       guarantees.  There were no other borrowings under the Working Capital
       Facility at June 30, 1994.

          In February 1994, the Partnership entered into an agreement with a
       group of banks to provide the Partnership with a $75 million credit
       facility (the Partnership Working Capital Facility).  The Partnership
       Working Capital Facility, which has a letter of credit subfacility for
       up to $25 million, provides for a three year maturity.  Borrowings
       under the Partnership Working Capital Facility are unsecured with a
       negative pledge on substantially all of the Partnership's assets.
       Borrowings under the Partnership Working Capital Facility bear interest
       at rates based on a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate.  The
       Partnership Working Capital Facility has minimum net Partners' capital,
       fixed charge and current ratio requirements, and places limitations on
       indebtedness of the Partnership and restricts the ability of the
       Partnership to make cash distributions in excess of Distributable Cash
       (as defined).  At June 30, 1994, the Partnership was in compliance with
       all of the covenants governing this agreement.  There is a 1/4 percent
       commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit line.  At June 30,
       1994, the Partnership had drawn down $4.9 million under the letter of
       credit subfacility and had no borrowings under the remainder of the
       Partnership Working Capital Facility.

          In October 1993, the Company completed its purchase of $220 million
       principal amount of its 11.25 percent Notes for $248.1 million which
       were originally scheduled to be due in annual installments from 1995 to
       2004.  The Notes were redeemed with the proceeds from the sale, on the
       same date, of $160 million of 9.25 percent Senior Notes due 2000 and
       3,450,000 shares of common stock.  In connection with this purchase,
       the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $23.8 million, net of
       income taxes, for the redemption premium incurred and write-off of
       previously deferred finance charges.

          In May 1994, the Company completed a public offering of 4,000,000
       shares of common stock.   Net proceeds of this offering were used to
       purchase the Company's 8 percent Note and portions of its 9.25 percent
       Senior Notes due 2000, 10.125 percent Senior Notes due 2001, and 10.75
       percent Senior Notes due 2003.  In connection with these purchases, the
       Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $1.4 million, net of income
       taxes, for the write-off of previously deferred finance charges
       associated with the Senior Notes, partially offset by a discount
       realized on the purchase of such Notes.

          Assuming the debt purchase and common stock offerings in the
       preceding two paragraphs had occurred on July 1, 1993, the pro forma
       net loss for the year ended June 30, 1994 would have been $17.5
       million, or $.59 per share, reflecting the increased number of shares
       outstanding, interest savings on lower debt balances, and the
       extraordinary charge.

           The Senior Notes and the Working Capital Facility contain
       provisions which (i) restrict the Company's ability to make capital
<PAGE>

       expenditures and dispose of assets, (ii) limit the payment of dividends
       or other distributions to stockholders, and (iii) limit the incurrence
       of additional indebtedness.  The Working Capital Facility also contains
       financial ratios and tests which must be met with respect to interest
       and fixed charge coverage, tangible net worth, working capital and
       total debt to capitalization.  The Company is currently in compliance
       with all of the covenants in the indentures and other agreements
       governing its indebtedness.

           The Convertible Subordinated Notes are exchangeable for
       approximately 1.8 million shares of the Company's common stock at
       $63.50 per share.

           Scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are
       as follows:

                   1995                         $1.1
                   1996                          8.8

           ----------------

       major projects under development.  All other interest is expensed as
       incurred.

       13. Pension Plans
           -------------
<PAGE>

           The Company has non-contributory pension plans that cover
       substantially all of its employees.  Benefits are based on a
       combination of years of service and compensation levels, depending on
       the plan.  Generally, contributions to the U.S. plans are made to meet
       minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security
       Act of 1974 (ERISA), while contributions to Canadian plans are made in
       accordance with Pension Benefits Acts, instituted by the provinces of
       Saskatchewan and Ontario.

           Employees in the United States whose pension benefits exceed ERISA
       limitations are covered by a supplementary non-qualified, unfunded
       pension plan which is provided for by charges to earnings sufficient to
       meet the projected benefit obligation.

           The components of net pension expense, computed actuarially, were
       as follows:

                              ======  ====== ====== ====== ====== ======

           Net pension expense for U.S. plans, in 1993, included $1.6 million
       related to the settlement of certain pension obligations.

           The plans' assets consist mainly of corporate equity and U.S.
       government and corporate debt securities, and units of participation in
       a collective short-term investment fund.

           In a number of these plans, the plan assets exceed the accumulated
       benefit obligations (overfunded plans) and in the remainder of the
       plans, the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the plan assets
       (underfunded plans).

           The funding status of the Company's pension plans, including
       Canadian plans and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance
       Sheet, was as follows:

       14. Other Postretirement Plans
           --------------------------
           The Company provides certain health care benefit plans for retired
       employees.  The plans may be either contributory or non-contributory
       and contain certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and
       coinsurance.  The plans are unfunded.  Employees are not vested and
       such benefits are subject to change.  Health care benefits of those
       employees who retired prior to February 1, 1988 are paid by
       Mallinckrodt Group Inc.; the Company is charged for one-half of such
       costs, not exceeding $.8 million in any fiscal year.

           The Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
       Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" effective July 1, 1992.
       This statement required that the cost of providing other postretirement
       benefits (OPEBS) be accrued during the active service period of the
       employees.  The Company recognized a $75.9 million liability for OPEBS
       as of July 1, 1992 and recorded an after-tax charge of $47.1 million
       for the cumulative effect of this accounting change.  This change
       increased the 1993 loss before accounting changes by $6.9 million, $4.3
       million after taxes, or $.19 per share.

           The components of OPEBS expense for years ending June 30 were as
       follows:

           Net amortization and deferral         (1.6)
                                                 ----      ----
                                                 $5.1      $8.6
                                                 ====      ====

           Prior to 1993, the Company recognized expense in the year health
       claims were paid.  The total cost to the Company of all postretirement
       health care costs was $1.7 million for the year ended June 30, 1992.

           On July 1, 1993, the Company amended its postretirement plans in an
       effort to control cash outlays while protecting the interests of those
       employees who have retired or will retire in the near future.  This
       plan amendment had the effect of reducing the accumulated
       postretirement benefit liability on July 1, 1993 by $15.9 million.  As
       a result, OPEBS expense was reduced by $1.1 million to reflect the
       amortization of this plan change over 13.8 years.

           The significant assumptions used in determining postretirement
       benefit costs were as follows:

                                                 1994      1993
                                                 ----      ----
           Discount rate                         8.4%      8.5%
           Health care trend rate:
            Under age 65                        10.4%     15.0%
            Over age 65                          7.0% (1)  8.2% (1)

           (1)  Decreasing gradually to 5.5% in 2003 and thereafter.

           If the health care trend rate assumptions were increased by 1.0
       percent, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would
       increase by 5.9 percent and 10.0 percent as of June 30, 1994 and 1993,
       respectively.  This would have the effect of an 8.2 percent and 11.0
       percent increase on OPEBS expense in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

           The components of the Company's postretirement benefit liability at
       June 30 were as follows:
                                                  1994         1993

       15. Income Taxes
           ------------
           The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
       effective July 1, 1991.  The cumulative effect of this accounting
       change decreased 1992 earnings by $165.5 million.

           Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
       differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
       reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

           Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities
       and assets at June 30 were as follows:

           At June 30, 1994, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
       for U.S. federal tax purposes of $264.5 million.  If not utilized
       against taxable income, $83.2 million of the federal tax loss
       carryforwards will expire in 2008 and $181.3 million will expire in
       2009.  The tax benefit of these loss carryforwards has been provided in
       the 1994 and 1993 Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred tax assets.

           The provision (credit) for income taxes consisted of the following:

           The effective tax rate for 1994 reflected the write-down of an
       investment in an oil and gas venture (see Note 6) and a deferred tax
       adjustment resulting from an increase in U.S. corporate income tax
       rates.  If these items were excluded, the Company's effective tax rate
       would have been 53.9 percent.

           U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes are provided on the
       earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be remitted to
       the extent that taxes on the distribution of such earnings would not be
       offset by foreign tax credits.  The Company has no present intention of
       remitting undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating
       $105.0 million at June 30, 1994, and accordingly, no deferred tax
       liability has been established relative to these earnings.

                                   ==========   ==========  ==========

           On October 5, 1993 and May 5, 1994, the Company completed public
       offerings of 3,450,000 shares and 4,000,000 shares of common stock at
       $34.50 and $37.00 per share, respectively.  Net proceeds of these
       offerings, net of issuance costs and expenses, were used to reduce
       long-term indebtedness.

           Pursuant to a Shareholders Rights Plan adopted by the Company in
       June 1989, a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right)
       for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company was issued on
       July 12, 1989 to shareholders of record on that date.  Under certain
       conditions, each Right may be exercised to purchase one one-hundredth
       of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, Series C, par value $1.00 per
       share, at a price of $150.  This preferred stock is designed to
       participate in dividends and vote on essentially equivalent terms with
       a whole share of common stock.  The Rights become exercisable apart
       from the common stock only if a person or group acquires 20 percent or
       more of the common stock or makes a tender offer for 20 percent or more
       of the outstanding common stock.  However, the Rights do not become
       exercisable if a person or group becomes the owner of 20 percent or
       more of the common stock as a result of the purchase of common stock by
       the Company to reduce the number of shares outstanding and increase the
       proportionate number of shares owned by such person or group to 20
       percent or more, unless such person or group subsequently becomes the
       owner of any additional shares of the common stock.  In addition, upon
       the acquisition by a person or group of 20 percent or more of the
       common stock, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the
       then-current exercise price of the Right, a number of shares of common
       stock having a market value at that time of twice the exercise price.
       The Rights may be redeemed at a price of $.01 per Right under certain
       circumstances prior to their expiration on June 21, 1999.  No event
       during 1994 made the Rights exercisable.

       17. Stock Plans
           -----------
           A non-qualified stock option plan adopted in 1988, as amended,
       provides for the granting of options to purchase up to two million
       shares of common stock at prices not less than 100 percent of market
       price at the date of the grant.  Options are exercisable over 10 years
       beginning one year after the date of the grant and are limited to 50
       percent during the second year.  A total of 1,630,974 shares was
       granted under this plan through June 30, 1994.

           Information on options follows:
                                      1994        1993         1992

           The average purchase price of outstanding stock options at June 30,
       1994 was $39.76 per share, based on an aggregate purchase price of
       $34.1 million.  Outstanding stock options will expire over a period
       ending no later than December 16, 2003.

           The Company also adopted a long-term incentive plan in 1991 under
       which officers and key managers were awarded shares of restricted
       common stock of the Company and contingent stock units.  Under the
       plan, these shares and units vested in whole or in part during and at
       the end of a three-year performance period which ended June 30, 1994.
       Out of a total of 207,615 shares of restricted common stock which was
       awarded under this plan, 122,451 shares did not vest and were
       cancelled, due to the non-attainment of objectives during the
       performance period.

           In fiscal 1994, the Company adopted a new long-term performance
       incentive plan beginning January 1, 1994.  A total of 70,380 shares of
       restricted common stock was awarded under this plan.  In accordance
       with these awards, shares of restricted common stock and contingent
       stock units will vest in whole or in part during and at the end of the
       three-year performance period ending June 30, 1997.


       18. Commitments
           -----------
           The Company leases various types of properties, including
       buildings, railcars, data processing equipment, and machinery and
       equipment through operating leases.  Included in selling, general and
       administrative expenses in 1992 is a charge of $3.2 million relating to
       the cancellation and buy out of equipment leases.
<PAGE>


           Summarized below is a schedule of future minimum lease payments
       under non-cancellable operating leases as of June 30, 1994:

           1995                               $16.7
           1996                                15.6

                                             =====

           Rental expense charged to earnings for 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted
       to $21.9 million, $18.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively.

           The Company participated in a consortium that won bids in 1988 on
       11 federal off-shore sulphur leases in the Gulf of Mexico.  Sulphur was
       subsequently discovered in one of these leases and is being extracted
       under a joint venture agreement with FRP and Felmont Oil Corporation.
       In connection with these leases, three of which still remain
       unexplored, the Company has committed to contribute its share of costs
       incurred in exploration and development of the remaining unexplored
       leases.  The Company has issued collateral mortgage notes totaling
       $145.8 million which will become effective only if the Company fails to
       meet its obligations under the Joint Operating Agreement covering each
       remaining lease.

           The Company's Canadian subsidiary is committed under a service
       agreement with PCS to produce annually from mineral reserves specified
       quantities of potash for a fixed fee plus a pro rata share of
       production and capital costs.  The agreement extends through June 30,
       1996 and is renewable at the option of PCS for six additional five-year
       periods.  Potash produced for PCS may, at PCS's option, amount to an
       annual maximum of approximately one-fourth of the Canadian subsidiary's
       production capacity.  During 1994, production of potash for PCS
       amounted to 500,000 tons, or 17 percent of tons produced.


       19. Contingencies
           -------------
           Since December 1985, the Company has experienced an inflow of water
       into one of its two interconnected potash mines in Saskatchewan,
       Canada.  The long-term trend of the water inflow has caused the Company
       to consider alternatives to its current mining operations and studies
       are under way in this regard.  Any solution to the water inflow
       situation at the mines could result in substantial capital
       expenditures.

           In 1993, Angus filed, but has not yet served, a lawsuit in
       Louisiana against the Company and two of its excess liability insurers
       seeking damages in addition to those paid in the Sterlington litigation
       discussed in Note 4.  The Company has been informed by counsel to Angus
       that the suit seeks damages allegedly related to (i) direct action
       claims against two of the Company's insurers, with one of which there
       is an agreement which that insurer might assert requires the Company to
       indemnify such insurer, (ii) third party claims against Angus, and
       (iii) sums already paid by Angus to third parties.  The Company
       believes that there are substantial defenses to the direct action
<PAGE>

       claims against its insurers and the claims for sums already paid by
       Angus to third parties, and that, in any event, the Company's exposure,
       if any, for such direct action claims is approximately $30 million.

           Later in 1993 the Company filed a lawsuit in Texas against Angus
       seeking a court determination that the settlement and final judgment
       (discussed in Note 4) entered in April of 1993 between and among the
       Company, Angus and its property insurer disposed of the Angus claims
       described in items (i) and (iii) above.  Angus filed a counterclaim
       seeking reimbursement for sums already paid by Angus to third parties.
       This lawsuit is still in the discovery phase, with trial of a portion
       of the case scheduled for October of 1994 and the remaining portion, if
       necessary, scheduled for February of 1995.  The trial judge has ruled
       that the terms of the April 1, 1993 settlement agreement with Angus do
       not bar Angus from bringing direct action claims in Louisiana against
       the Company's insurers, but did not rule as to whether such claims have
       any merit under Louisiana law.  The judge also ruled that the terms of
       the same settlement agreement do not bar Angus from making claims
       against the Company for sums already paid to third parties by Angus.
       Angus' responses to discovery requests indicate that the Company's
       exposure for sums already paid to third parties is approximately $10
       million.  Neither of the rulings addressed the question of whether the
       final judgment acts as a bar to direct action claims by Angus or claims
       by Angus for sums paid to third parties.  The Company intends to
       vigorously litigate these matters; however, given that the Texas
       lawsuit is in its early stages and discovery is not complete, the
       Louisiana lawsuit has not been served, and the uncertainties inherent
       in litigation, no assurances can be given that the Company will prevail
       in these matters.

           The Company has been named as a defendant, along with other
       Canadian and U.S. potash producers, in lawsuits filed in federal court
       in Minnesota and state court in California.  The plaintiffs are
       purchasers of potash who allege a price fixing conspiracy among North
       American potash producers beginning in 1987 and continuing until the
       filing of the lawsuits.  Discovery is being conducted with respect to
       the limited question of whether the court should certify a class or
       classes of potash purchasers in the Minnesota litigation.  The parties
       in the cases filed in California are awaiting judicial determination as
       to whether the cases should proceed in federal court in Minnesota or
       state court in California.  While the Company believes that the
       allegations in the complaints are without merit, until discovery has
       been completed it is unable to evaluate possible defenses or to make a
       reliable determination as to potential liability exposure, if any.

           The Company has also received a U.S. grand jury subpoena seeking
       information related to the sale of potash in the United States from
       1986 to the present.  The Company is cooperating with the government
       and is assembling the information needed to comply with the subpoena.
       As in the civil antitrust matters described above, while the Company
       does not believe that violations of the antitrust laws have occurred,
       the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the government
       investigation or make a reliable determination as to potential
       exposure, if any.

           The Company also has certain other contingent liabilities with
       respect to litigation, claims and guarantees of debt obligations to
       third parties arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company
       does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will have a
       material adverse impact on the Company's financial position.

                                                                  Draft Dated
                                                            December 14, 1993

                                PROPOSED PURCHASE OF
                $5 MILLION OF SENIOR SUBORDINATED PREFERRED STOCK OF
                                ASHTA CHEMICALS, INC.

                 Ashta Chemicals, Inc. (``Ashta'') is a major potash  customer
       of IMC  Fertilizer,  Inc.  (``IMC''
                                         ).   Ashta  was  the  subject  of  a
       leveraged buyout  in  1989  and  has  been  in  and  out  of  financial
       difficulty since that  time.   Ashta is  currently in  default under  a
       $65,000,000 secured  credit  facility  from  General  Electric  Capital
       Corporation (``
                     GECC'') and has been negotiating w ith GECC in an effort
       to restructure its debt.

                 To help keep Ashta's potash business, IMC would like to grant
       Ashta a $7.50 per ton price  concession for potash purchased from  IMC,
       such price concession to be made in the form of an investment in  Ashta
       senior subordinated preferred stock.

                 The preferred stock  investment would  be made  by a  special
       purpose subsidiary of IMC and would  be an integral part of a  proposed
       debt restructuring  for  Ashta  the basic  structure  of  which  is  as
       follows:

                 $22 million of  secured credit from  GECC provided through  a
                 lending partnership;

                 $15 million of  senior preferred  stock issued  to a  lending
                 partnership and held for the benefit of GECC;

                 $5 million of senior subordinated preferred stock issued to a
                 special purpose subsidiary of IMC;

                 $5 million of junior subordinated preferred stock issued to a
                 lending partnership and held for the benefit of GECC.



                 The purchase of Ashta's  senior subordinated preferred  stock
       by the special purpose subsidiary of IMC would be made as follows:

                 For each ton of potash purchased by Ashta from IMC during the
                 period commencing  November 1,  1992 and  ending October  31,
                 1997 IMC's subsidiary (using funds contributed by IMC)  would
                 purchase $7.50 of Ashta  senior subordinated preferred  stock
                 up  to  a  maximum  of  $5,000,000  of  senior   subordinated
                 preferred stock.   IMC's  subsidiary  would make  an  initial
                 purchase of up to $1,500,000 of senior subordinated preferred
                 stock in  December  1993  - approximately  $750,000  of  that
                 initial purchase  would recognize  potash purchases  made  by
                 Ashta through December 1993 and would be paid in the form  of
                 cash.  The remaining amount of that initial purchase would be
                 in anticipation of potash  purchases Ashta would be  required
                 to make  from January  1994 through  February 1995  (and  for
                 which Ashta would make a cash downpayment) and would be  paid
                 in the form of cash.
<PAGE>

                 The senior  subordinated preferred  stock  would have  a  par
       value of  $1,000  per share  and  would yield  a  cumulative  quarterly
       dividend at  the  rate  of  6% per  annum.    The  senior  subordinated
       preferred stock would  be redeemed  in 8  equal quarterly  installments
       commencing June 30,  2000 and ending  March 31, 2003  subject to  Ashta
       having funds legally available for such redemption.

                                       * * * *

                 The proposed purchase of Ashta senior subordinated  preferred
       stock is, essentially, a $7.50 per ton price concession in a form  that
       makes it  possible for  IMC to  recapture  the price  concession  (with
       interest) at  a later  date.   Additionally, the  proposed purchase  of
       Ashta  senior   subordinated  preferred   stock  will   aid  Ashta   in
       restructuring its debt and  thereby help ensure  Ashta's vitality as  a
       major consumer of potash into the future.

       This calculation is submitted in accordance with Regulation S-K item
       601(b)(11).  However, under APB Opinion No. 15, calculation of fully
       diluted earnings (loss) per share would exclude the conversion of
       convertible securities which would have an antidilutive effect on
       earnings (loss) per share for each period.
