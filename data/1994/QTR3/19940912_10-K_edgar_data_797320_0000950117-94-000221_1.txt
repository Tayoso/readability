ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS
 
     First  Brands  Corporation ('First  Brands' or  'the Company'),  a Delaware
corporation, was organized  in March,  1986 to  acquire the  worldwide home  and
automotive  products  business  (the 'Predecessor  Business')  of  Union Carbide
Corporation ('Union Carbide') in  a leveraged buyout which  was effective as  of
July  1, 1986. The Company is primarily engaged in the development, manufacture,
marketing and  sale of  branded  and private  label  consumer products  for  the
household  and automotive markets. The Company's  products can be found in large
merchandise and  chain  supermarkets  and  other  retail  outlets.  The  Company
believes  that the  significant market  positions occupied  by its  products are
attributable  to  brand  name  recognition,  comprehensive  product   offerings,
continued  product innovation, strong emphasis  on vendor support and aggressive
advertising and promotion.
 
     Home products include the most complete line of branded plastic wrap,  bags
and  drinking straws in  the United States  and Canada, which  is sold under the
GLAD (and related GLAD-LOCK) brands. Plastic bags are also sold in Canada  under
the SURTEC brand. Clumping cat litter products are sold under the SCOOP AWAY and
EVER  CLEAN brands.  Automotive products  include PRESTONE,  the leading branded
antifreeze/coolant  in  the  United  States,  automotive  specialty  performance
products  sold under  the STP  and PRESTONE  brands, and  cleaners, polishes and
waxes sold  under the  SIMONIZ brand.  Consumers have  been purchasing  products
under  the SIMONIZ, PRESTONE, STP, GLAD and  SCOOP AWAY brand names for over 83,
67, 40, 31 and 5 years, respectively.
 
     On August 26, 1994,  the Company sold  its PRESTONE antifreeze/coolant  and
car  care business ('the Prestone Business') to Prestone Products Corporation, a
newly formed  corporation organized  and controlled  by Vestar  Equity  Partners
L.P.,  a private  investment firm,  for $142,000,000  in cash  and a $13,000,000
7 1/2% subordinated debenture  maturing in 2003,  which for financial  statement
purposes has been valued at $9,000,000.
 
     Through  its subsidiary, Himolene Incorporated ('Himolene'), the Company is
the leading producer in the United States of high molecular weight high  density
polyethylene  plastic  trash can  liners  for the  institutional  and industrial
markets.
 
     A&M Products, Inc.  ('A&M'), a  wholly owned  subsidiary, manufactures  and
markets  SCOOP AWAY and EVER CLEAN, the leading brands of clumping cat litter in
the United States. On July 13, 1994,  A&M acquired the cat litter and  absorbent
mineral assets of Excel Mineral Inc. and Excel International Inc. ('Excel'). The
Excel business includes the JONNY CAT brand of cat care products.
 
     The  Company  has  engaged in  the  automotive service  market  through the
operation of its service center facilities  which feature the STP, PRESTONE  AND
SIMONIZ  brand  products and  furnish a  variety of  automotive services  to the
public. The Company operates four such centers in Charlotte, North Carolina  and
Orlando,  Florida. After reviewing the performance  of the existing centers, the
Company decided to phase  out these service centers,  and during August of  1994
has sold its two North Carolina stores.
 
     In  general First Brands does not produce against a backlog of firm orders;
production  is  geared  primarily  to  the  level  of  incoming  orders  and  to
projections  of  future demand.  Significant  inventories of  finished products,
work-in-process and raw materials are  maintained to meet delivery  requirements
of customers and First Brands production schedules.
 
     There  is no  significant seasonal  fluctuation in  sales of  the Company's
home,  cat   litter,   institutional   and   industrial   products.   Sales   of
antifreeze/coolant  have been seasonal with sales concentrated in the first half
of the Company's fiscal year  due to increased consumer  demand in the fall  and
winter  months. Historically, sales of  antifreeze/coolant during the first half
of the  fiscal year  have represented  more  than 70%  of the  Company's  annual
antifreeze/coolant  sales. However, antifreeze/coolant is  the major part of the
Prestone Business which, as noted above, was sold on August 26, 1994, making the
Company's business in general, significantly  less seasonal. With the  exception
of  certain SIMONIZ products,  for which sales  tend to be  higher in the second
half of  the Company's  fiscal year,  sales of  the Company's  other  automotive
products are generally constant throughout the year.
 
     The  Company's products are  sold directly to  retailers and to wholesalers
and can be found in large mass merchandise stores and chain supermarkets as well
as other retail outlets, including automotive supply stores, grocery stores  and
price   clubs.   While   the  Company's   sales   are  not   dependent   upon  a
 
                                       1
 
<PAGE>
single customer, the  top 25 customers  account for approximately  48% of  total
sales, and sales to its largest customer, the Wal-Mart Stores and Sams Wholesale
Club stores, are approximately 14% of total sales.
 
     Sales  to food  outlets, which  account for  approximately 70%  of domestic
sales of plastic  wrap and bags  as well as  cat litter, are  handled through  a
network  of brokers;  sales to mass  merchandisers are handled  by First Brands'
direct sales force. Sales of  automotive products are primarily handled  through
First  Brands'  direct sales  force  and sold  to  mass merchandisers.  Sales by
Himolene to  the  institutional  and  industrial markets  are  handled  by  that
subsidiary's  direct sales force  as well as through  distributors. Sales of the
Company's products  in  Canada are  generally  handled  in the  same  manner  as
domestic   sales.  Other  international  sales  are  handled  primarily  through
distributors.
 
     The Company believes its  manufacturing facilities employ  state-of-the-art
technology.  The  plastic wrap  and bag  manufacturing process  employs advanced
extrusion and conversion technologies. Each of the Company's  antifreeze/coolant
plants is an integrated operation, including blending, bottlemaking, filling and
packaging.  The Company's  strategy is  to update  and expand  its manufacturing
facilities with internally developed technologies  (some of which are  patented)
and  state-of-the-art technology acquired from  third-party sources. The Company
has improved existing process  technologies, acquired additional equipment  used
in  the  production of  existing products  and  added new  product manufacturing
capabilities.
 
     The Company currently purchases a  substantial portion of its raw  material
requirements  pursuant  to long-term  contracts  with Union  Carbide Corporation
which is the Company's largest  single supplier. These contracts are  considered
to  be material to the business of the  Company. The Company believes that it is
also Union  Carbide's largest  customer for  polyethylene resin,  from which  it
produces  plastic wrap  and bags,  and ethylene  glycol, from  which it produces
antifreeze/coolant. The  Company  has a  contract  with Union  Carbide  for  the
purchase of a substantial portion of its polyethylene resin requirements through
December   31,  1994  and  thereafter  for  successive  three-year  terms  until
terminated by either party by  notice one year prior  to expiration of any  such
term.  Presently,  renegotiation  for  a  new  contract  with  Union  Carbide is
underway. The Company also has a contract with Union Carbide for the purchase of
a substantial portion of the  Company's ethylene glycol requirements which  will
be  in effect through December  31, 1996 and thereafter  from year to year until
terminated by either party on 24 months notice. The Company has other  long-term
contracts  with several other  suppliers for substantially  all of its remaining
requirements for  ethylene glycol.  These ethylene  glycol contracts  have  been
assigned  to  the purchasers  of  the Prestone  Business.  The Company  also has
contracts for  the purchase  of certain  raw materials,  including  polyethylene
resin,  from other suppliers, and makes purchases on the open market as well. In
the past,  certain of  the Company's  raw materials  supply contracts  were  not
necessarily  responsive to market conditions  and, therefore, resulted from time
to time in higher or lower prices for the relevant raw materials than the prices
paid by  the Company's  competitors.  The pricing  provisions in  the  Company's
present  supply contracts are designed to  be responsive to market conditions of
the relevant raw materials.
 
     Although the  Company  believes  that,  based  on  industry  estimates  and
projections,  raw  material costs  will, over  the long-term,  remain relatively
level, it is unable  to predict with  any certainty its  costs of raw  materials
which  may, because  of market  conditions, be  materially higher  or lower than
those experienced in past periods. To the extent raw material costs are  higher,
the Company's margins on the relevant products could be adversely affected if it
is  unable to increase prices, effect  offsetting cost savings, or reduce prices
to meet competition. As a consequence, the Company may be adversely affected  by
changes  in raw material  markets. However, the Company  believes that, if there
were an industry wide  shortage of raw materials,  it might enjoy a  competitive
advantage  over certain of its competitors as  a result of its assured source of
supply for a substantial portion of its raw materials.
 
     Most  of  the  raw  materials  used  by  First  Brands  are   petrochemical
derivatives  primarily produced from ethylene which  in turn is largely produced
from natural gas in  the United States  and Canada. Historically,  petrochemical
derivatives  have been  subject to  price fluctuations  due to  various factors.
There can  be  no assurances  that  future  events will  not  precipitate  price
increases.  The  factors which  will affect  the  cost of  raw materials  to the
Company will generally affect competitors' raw material costs as well.  However,
because  several  of the  Company's major  competitors  are units  of vertically
integrated
 
                                       2
 
<PAGE>
enterprises, they may be able to vary internal pricing arrangements in order  to
mitigate,  in  their end-product  markets,  adverse movements  in  raw materials
prices and thereby enjoy a competitive advantage.
 
     Most other raw  materials are  generally available in  the marketplace  and
First  Brands  believes that  it  has contracts  and  commitments, or  a readily
available source of supply, to meet  its anticipated needs in all major  product
areas.
 
     First  Brands currently  employs approximately 3,700  persons worldwide, of
which about 3,200  are in  the United States.  The Company's  employees are  not
unionized  with the exception of approximately 600 hourly workers at one plastic
wrap and bag plant who are represented by the United Paperworkers  International
Union.  The contract with the  union has been extended  to run through February,
1995.  The  Company  has  not  experienced  any  significant  interruptions   or
curtailments  of  operations  due to  labor  disputes, and  considers  its labor
relations to be satisfactory.
 
     First Brands  operates  in  highly competitive  markets  where  success  is
dependent upon brand recognition, product innovation and performance, and price.
In several instances, the competitors are larger, more integrated companies with
greater financial resources than First Brands.

     Certain of the Company's operations are subject to federal, state and local
environmental  laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of
pollutants into the  air and water  and establish standards  for the  treatment,
storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that it
is  in  substantial  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and
regulations.
 
     During fiscal  1994,  1993 and  1992,  First Brands  made  expenditures  of
approximately   $3,259,000,   $2,110,000  and   $2,018,000,   respectively,  for
environmental compliance at its facilities, and currently estimates that it will
make expenditures for  environmental compliance of  approximately $3,000,000  in
fiscal 1995.
 
     The   Company's   Paulsboro,  New   Jersey  facility   is  subject   to  an
administrative consent order  with the  New Jersey  Department of  Environmental
Protection  and Energy which was entered into in connection with the purchase of
such facility from Union Carbide pursuant to the requirements of the New  Jersey
Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act. This order provides for soil and water
testing,  a cleanup plan and certain site  cleanup; and a financial guarantee of
compliance.  The  Company   assumed  these  obligations   from  Union   Carbide.
Preliminary  testing  has  been completed  and  a  site clean-up  plan  has been
submitted with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy.
This  plan  has  been  conditionally  accepted  and  is  subject  to  continuing
discussions. If this plan is accepted, it is projected that the compliance costs
will  be within the Company's estimates. However, there can be no assurance that
the final costs will not exceed these estimated costs.

     As a result of the assumption  of liabilities described below, the  Company
has a potential liability under Superfund or similar state law for investigation
and  cleanup costs at four sites, in  addition to Paulsboro described above. The
United States  Environmental Protection  Agency ('EPA')  has notified  over  100
companies,  including  First Brands,  at two  sites that  the EPA  considers the
companies to be potentially responsible parties under Superfund. The third  site
is voluntarily being cleaned up by a group of companies, including First Brands,
with  no EPA involvement.  The Company, along  with 31 other  companies has been
made party to a suit by a  landowner for contribution for ground water clean  up
costs  at a fourth site. Currently,  the Company cannot determine accurately its
ultimate liability, if  any, for investigation  or cleanup costs  at these  four
sites,  although the  Company believes that,  based on  the numerous potentially
responsible parties at each site and  the relatively small volume of waste  sent
to  these sites  by the  Predecessor Business, its  liability, if  any, would be
small and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. Environmental
expenditure estimates discussed above do  not include costs resulting from  such
liabilities.
 
     Although  the  Company  has assumed  most  environmental  liabilities which
relate  to  conditions  existing  or  actions  taken  in  connection  with   the
Predecessor  Business  prior to  April  21, 1986,  the  date of  the acquisition
agreement  with  Union  Carbide  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  the
Predecessor  Business, to the extent that the Company incurs such liabilities or
liabilities which relate to compliance with any requirement of an  environmental
law or regulation which existed as of the date of the acquisition agreement, the
Company  will be entitled to indemnification from  Union Carbide for 85% of such
liabilities in excess  of $10,000,000 (providing  such liabilities are  asserted
and  written notice  of such  assertion has been  given to  Union Carbide within
three years of  the effective closing  date of  July 1, 1986),  up to  aggregate
expenditures   by  Union  Carbide  for   such  liabilities  (and  certain  other
liabilities specified in the acquisition agreement) of $75,000,000. Accordingly,
the Company will  bear the first  $10,000,000 of such  liabilities, 15% of  such
liabilities   in  excess  of  $10,000,000   until  Union  Carbide  has  expended
$75,000,000 for such environmental liabilities and 100% thereafter. The  Company
has  provided  Union Carbide  with  written notice  asserting  certain potential
liabilities within  the  three-year  period.  The Company  will  bear  any  such
liabilities asserted following the three-year indemnification period. Management
of the Company is not aware of any such liabilities which are significant.
 
     Through  research and  development, management  is committed  to developing
process technologies  and  new products  which  are critical  to  the  Company's
objective of providing high quality, innovative consumer products at costs which
the  Company believes are  equal to or  less than those  of its competitors. The
Company spent $6,287,000, $8,049,000 and $9,292,000 during fiscal 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively, on research and development. In addition to state-of-the-art
equipment and facilities, each  of the home  products and automotive  businesses
has its own Research and Development Director and research staff to focus on its
business opportunities.
 
     Through  the use  of its  high molecular  weight high  density polyethylene
technology, Himolene  produces stronger  plastic bags  with less  raw  material,
resulting  in  a conservation  of resources  and a  reduction of  materials that
eventually go into landfills.
 
     Product  innovation  and   improvement  are  important   elements  in   the
maintenance  and expansion of  the Company's market share.  In the home products
business, the Company  has emphasized  improved product  value, convenience  and
performance.  Product enhancements  during the  year have  included the expanded
selection of GLAD-LOCK  bulk packs,  an expanded  product line  of TIE-TITE  and
TIE-TIE  waste disposer bags, and the new GLAD LUNCH 'N MORE reusable lunch bag.
The SCOOP AWAY and EVER CLEAN  product lines continue to expand with  convenient
new packaging and improved clumping technology.
 
     In  the automotive  business, the Company  continues to  expand its product
selection in the branded performance and maintenance category with STP  SYNBLEND
motor oil, a blend of synthic and mineral based oils, and STP FUEL STABILIZER.
 
     Prestone  Technology Systems Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is engaged in
proprietary antifreeze recycling and  reinhibiting technology. Targeted  towards
the  service sector, and  the heavy duty/fleet  area, this subsidiary represents
years of research and development, enabling the Company to further leverage  the
PRESTONE  brand. The  assets of this  business are  included in the  sale of the
Prestone Business.

     The Company presently reprocesses plastic  trimmings and scrap in both  its
GLAD  and PRESTONE manufacturing facilities. The  packages for all GLAD products
are made with reclaimed paperboard.
 
ITEM 2 -- PROPERTIES
 
     First Brands uses  various owned  or leased  plants, technical  facilities,
warehouses,  distribution centers and offices in the United States, Puerto Rico,
Canada, Hong Kong,  England, Mexico,  Spain and the  Philippines. The  Company's
world headquarters is located in Danbury, Connecticut.
 
     First   Brands   believes   current  facilities,   together   with  planned
expenditures for normal  maintenance, capacity  and technological  improvements,
will  provide  adequate  production capacity  to  meet expected  demand  for its
products.
 
     Listed below are the principal  manufacturing facilities operated by  First
Brands and its consolidated subsidiaries worldwide during fiscal 1994:

  * The Company has completed Sale/Leaseback Agreements for substantially all of
    the  production equipment at  its Arkansas and Georgia  plastic wrap and bag
    plants and a majority of the  GLAD-LOCK equipment at its Virginia  facility.
    The Company retained the ownership of the real property and certain personal
    property at each site but has leased such real property or granted easements
    appurtenant  thereto for 10-year terms to  the respective facility lessor at
    the Arkansas and Georgia plants who, in turn, has agreed to have the Company
    operate and maintain  such real  property and equipment  facilities and  has
    sublet  such  real property  back to  the  Company during  the term  of each
    facility lease. These transactions were  undertaken to reduce the  Company's
    financing  costs. Most  plant and  Company-owned equipment  at the Arkansas,
    Georgia and  Virginia  facilities  is  subject  to  liens  pursuant  to  the
    Sale/Leaseback  Agreements. See Notes 8 and  9 to the Company's Consolidated
    Financial Statements.
 
 ** These facilities are included in the sale of the Prestone Business.
 
*** During 1994, the  Company completed  the transfer of  cat litter  production
    from  its Houston,  Texas facility  to it's  newly constructed  Spring Hill,
    Kansas plant. The lease  agreement for the  Houston location expired  during
    fiscal  1994 and has been renewed on  a month to month basis until September
    30, 1994.

     The Illinois facility as well as  the West Chicago, Illinois and the  Bell,
California  facilities are located on leased  land under leases of varying terms
which expire between 1994  and 1996 with average  annual rentals of $160,000  in
the aggregate. The Houston, Texas lease expired during March 1994 and was rented
monthly  until June 1994, resulting  in a total rental  expense of $354,000. The
Hong Kong and  Philippines facilities are  leased from third  parties. The  Hong
Kong  lease expires in  1996 and has  an average annual  rental of approximately
$310,000; the Philippines lease expires in 1997 and has an average annual rental
of approximately $90,000. All other production  plants are owned by the  Company
or its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
     First  Brands maintains  research and  development facilities  for its home
products in Willowbrook, Illinois, and  for its automotive products in  Danbury,
Connecticut;  both facilities  are under long  term leases expiring  in 1998 and
1999, respectively. As part  of the sale of  the Prestone Business, the  Company
will  obtain automotive laboratory services from Prestone  at cost for up to two
years. In addition, First Brands  maintains numerous domestic and  international
administrative  and sales offices and warehouses. The majority of these premises
are either leased under relatively short-term leases or owned.
 
ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The  Company  and  Prestone  Technology   Systems  Inc.,  a  wholly   owned
subsidiary,  have been named  as defendant in  a suit brought  by American Fluid
Technologies ('AFT') and  as a  defendant with AFT  as a  co-defendant in  suits
brought  by  two  AFT  franchisees  in  connection  with  its  mobile  recycling
antifreeze technology.  The suits  are in  the early  stages of  discovery,  and
valuation  of  the claims  is pending  further  discovery, although  the alleged
claims are  not expected  to have  a material  adverse effect  on the  Company's
financial  position or  results of operations.  The Company  has not transferred
liability, if any, for these suits to Prestone Products.
 
     The Company has been named as defendant in various other claims arising  as
a  normal part of  its business, including three  pending lawsuits involving STP
Flat Tire Repair which was recalled in January, 1994 as a result of concerns for
the products safety arising from its  misuse. Based upon the facts available  to
date,  management believes  the Company  has meritorious  defenses to  all these
actions and that their ultimate resolution of these actions and claims will  not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1993
 
     Sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 were $1,086,320,000, 4% above
the prior year's sales of $1,041,857,000. Total sales dollars and quantities  in
the  Company's plastic wrap and  bag business were above  the prior year's level
primarily due to strong sales of  GLAD-LOCK products. This shift in product  mix
also  had a  favorable impact  on the Company's  average selling  price. The pet
products business had significant growth throughout fiscal 1994, with  increases
in  both volume  and dollar  sales. The  average selling  price during  the year
declined slightly due to  the introduction of new  economy pack litter  products
and  the expansion into warehouse clubs with larger sizes. Automotive speciality
and appearance products, primarily STP branded products, also recorded increases
in sales volumes and  dollars. As discussed  in Note 19,  the Company sold  it's
antifreeze/coolant  and other car care business on August 26, 1994. While volume
sales for  this business  were  up during  fiscal  1994, this  segment  reported
slightly  lower sales  due to  reduced selling  prices reflecting  the Company's
lower price marketing program which was instituted in fiscal 1994. Excluding the
negative impact  of the  strong  U.S. dollar  during 1994,  international  sales
revenues  in local currency were ahead of the prior year's results due to volume
increases in all but one of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
     Cost of goods sold in fiscal  1994 was $665,896,000 versus $646,298,000  in
fiscal  1993.  The 3%  increase  in costs  primarily  reflects the  higher sales
volumes during 1994. Gross profit for the year of $420,424,000 (39%) was 106% of
1993's  $395,559,000  (38%   of  sales).  The   higher  gross  profit   reflects
 
                                       9
 
<PAGE>
higher  sales  levels, along  with the  favorable impact  of slightly  lower raw
material costs,  a  favorable product  mix,  lower manufacturing  costs  due  to
increased  efficiencies, and reduced rental  expense resulting from renegotiated
rental agreements.
 
     Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $269,181,000 were 4% above
fiscal 1993's $257,799,000, reflecting higher consumer promotion spending in the
plastic wrap and bag, STP and cat litter businesses. Increased spending in these
areas was  partially  offset by  lower  expenditures in  the  antifreeze/coolant
business due to the aforementioned change to a lower price marketing strategy.
 
     Amortization  and  other depreciation  expense of  $20,768,000 was  109% of
1993's $19,079,000 reflecting the write-down of certain fixed assets which  were
either  sold during fiscal 1994  or are expected to  be sold during early fiscal
1995. Amortization expense largely relates to intangibles recorded in 1986  when
the  Company  acquired its  businesses. The  after-tax amounts  for amortization
expense on  a per  share basis  was $0.55  and $0.59  in fiscal  1994 and  1993,
respectively,  a portion  of which  is not  deductible for  income tax purposes.
During fiscal  1994 interest  expense  of $22,390,000  was  87% of  last  year's
$25,620,000  due to lower  debt levels and reduced  rates. Interest expense also
includes the  amortization  of various  financing  and legal  costs  which  were
incurred  in  the issuance  of  Company debt.  Discount  on sale  of receivables
reflects the costs associated with the sale of a fractional ownership  interest,
without  recourse, in  a defined pool  of the Company's  eligible trade accounts
receivable.
 
     The  provision  for  income  taxes  of  $43,569,000  was  120%  of   1993's
$36,327,000  reflecting this year's higher pre-tax income and an increase in the
federal tax rate from 34% to 35%.
 
     Inflation was not considered  to be a significant  factor in the  Company's
operations during fiscal 1994.
 
     In   November,  1992,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  112,   'Employers'
Accounting  for Postemployment Benefits'.  SFAS No. 112  concerns those benefits
provided by an  employer to former  or inactive employees  after employment  but
before  retirement. SFAS No. 112 requires that the expense associated with these
benefits be  recognized  on  an  accrual basis.  The  Company  will  adopt  this
statement  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1995.  Preliminary  analysis
indicates that the adoption of SFAS No.  112 will not have a material impact  on
the consolidated financial position or operating results of the Company.
 
FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1992
 
     Sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 were $1,041,857,000, 5% above
1992's  sales  of $988,533,000.  Excluding sales  from  A&M Products,  which was
acquired in May, 1992, revenues during fiscal 1993 were approximately even  with
fiscal 1992.
 
     Sales  volumes  in  the  Company's  plastic  wrap  and  bag  business  were
moderately ahead  of the  prior year's  levels, however,  lower average  selling
prices  due to the product mix, resulted  in sales revenues being slightly below
the prior year.  The antifreeze/coolant business  recorded substantially  higher
sales  volumes in  fiscal 1993  due to  a significant  increase in  the level of
private label antifreeze/coolant sales. Although the Company's
antifreeze/coolant unit sales increased, the lower selling price associated with
private label product resulted in fiscal 1993 sales revenues being approximately
even with the  1992 level.  Sales of other  automotive products  were above  the
prior  year's  level  due  to  higher  volumes.  Performances  of  the Company's
international subsidiaries were  adversely affected by  lower exchange rates  in
fiscal  1993, resulting in  sales revenues and  operating profits being slightly
below the 1992 level.
 
     Cost of goods sold in fiscal  1993 was $646,298,000 versus $599,709,000  in
fiscal 1992. The 8% increase in costs reflects the higher sales volumes in 1993,
a  different product mix and  higher resin costs compared  to the prior year, as
well  as   sharply  lower   ethylene  glycol   prices  offset   by  the   higher
antifreeze/coolant  volume. Gross  profit for the  year of  $395,559,000 (38% of
sales) was 102% of 1992's $388,824,000  (39% of sales). The higher gross  profit
reflects  higher sales, while the lower gross profit margin resulted from a less
favorable product mix, and comparatively lower resin costs in fiscal 1992.
 
     Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $257,799,000 were 1% above
fiscal 1992's $255,036,000, reflecting  higher expenditures associated with  A&M
Products, partially offset by lower
 
                                       10
 
<PAGE>
advertising  and promotion costs compared to  last year's higher spending levels
to support the launch of new automotive products and the GLAD-LOCK expansion.
 
     Amortization and  other  depreciation expense  of  $19,079,000 was  85%  of
1992's  $22,360,000 reflecting  lower amortization  as certain  intangibles were
fully amortized or  written off during  fiscal 1992. The  after-tax amounts  for
amortization  expense on  a per share  basis was  $0.59 in both  fiscal 1993 and
1992, respectively,  a  portion  of  which is  not  deductible  for  income  tax
purposes. Interest expense of $25,620,000 was 64% of last year's $39,877,000 due
to  lower debt  levels and  reduced rates.  Interest expenses  also includes the
amortization  of  various  financing  and  legal  costs.  Discount  on  sale  of
receivables  reflects  the  costs  associated  with  the  sale  of  a fractional
ownership interest,  without  recourse,  in  a defined  pool  of  the  Company's
eligible  trade accounts receivable  for a full  year in fiscal  1993 versus one
month in fiscal 1992.
 
     The provision  for  income  taxes  of  $36,327,000  was  33%  above  1992's
$27,217,000 reflecting the higher pre-tax income.
 
     Inflation  was not considered  to be a significant  factor in the Company's
operations during fiscal 1993.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
     Worldwide  credit  facilities  in  place   at  June  30,  1994   aggregated
$195,786,000 of which $190,850,000 was available but unused. The Company expects
to  borrow up to $40,000,000  from these credit facilities  over the next twelve
months, primarily  for  seasonal  working capital  purposes.  The  Company  also
utilizes  a  $100,000,000 extendable  three  year agreement  to  sell fractional
ownership interest, without  recourse, in  a defined pool  of eligible  accounts
receivable (See Note 2).
 
     The   Company's  fiscal   1995  plan   reflects  capital   expenditures  of
approximately $35,000,000 and  fixed payments  (interest, principal,  receivable
financing costs and lease payments) of approximately $45,000,000.
 
     Capital  expenditures,  including  capitalized  interest,  were $39,753,000
during fiscal 1994, and $39,105,000 in fiscal 1993. Expenditures were  primarily
related to GLAD-LOCK zipper plastic storage bag and GLAD HANDLE-TIE disposer bag
capacity,  the Company's GLAD Amherst, Virginia facility, and A&M's Spring Hill,
Kansas facility, as well as cost reductions and technology improvements.  During
fiscal   1993,  the  Company  acquired  previously  leased  equipment  totalling
$3,015,000.  Principal  payments  due  on  long-term  debt  (including   current
maturities)  total $122,123,000 for the five-year period beginning July 1, 1994,
and $27,533,000 for the five-year period thereafter.
 
     As a result of the  public offering of its Common  Stock in March 1991  and
the  total redemption of the  12 1/2% Debentures, the  Company may be obligated,
pursuant to  the  Note  Purchase  Agreement governing  the  13  1/4%  Notes,  to
repurchase the remaining $45,000,000 outstanding of the 13 1/4% Notes at par not
earlier  than 15 months after  receipt of notice from the  holder of the 13 1/4%
Notes of its intention to  require such prepayment. To  date no such notice  has
been  received. If the Company became obligated to repurchase the 13 1/4% Notes,
it would be required to  obtain waivers from the  Banks and to incur  additional
debt.  The Company does not expect  the holder of the 13  1/4% Notes to give any
such notice.
 
     The Company's debt agreements have restrictions on the Company's ability to
incur certain indebtedness; however, based on its working capital  requirements,
the  current  availability  under  its credit  facilities,  and  its  ability to
generate  funds  from  operations,  the  Company  does  not  believe  that  such
limitations  will have a  material effect on  the Company's long-term liquidity.
The Company believes that it  will have the funds necessary  to meet all of  its
above  described financing requirements and  all other fixed obligations. Should
the Company undertake in the  future, strategic acquisitions requiring funds  in
excess  of its  internally generated  cash flow, it  might be  required to incur
additional debt.
 
     Certain of the Company's operations are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge  of
pollutants  into the  air and water  and establish standards  for the treatment,
storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that it
is  in  substantial  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and
regulations. Pursuant to
 
                                       11
 
<PAGE>
the  acquisition  agreement, the  Company assumed  certain liabilities  of Union
Carbide including most  environmental liabilities  connected with  the home  and
automotive  businesses. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
a discussion of indemnifications. The  Company's Paulsboro, New Jersey  facility
is  subject to an administrative consent order with the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection.  The  Company also  has  a potential  liability  under
Superfund  or  similar state  law for  investigation and  cleanup costs  at four
sites. The  Company  believes that  it  has  made adequate  provision  for  such
compliance  costs, but there can  be no assurance that  the final costs will not
exceed the Company's estimated costs of compliance.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
 
     The management of First Brands Corporation is responsible for the financial
and operating information contained in the Annual Report including the financial
statements covered by  the independent  auditors report.  These statements  were
prepared   in  conformity  with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting
principles and include, where necessary, informed estimates and judgements.
 
     The Company maintains systems of  accounting and internal control  designed
to  provide reasonable assurance  that assets are  safeguarded against loss, and
that transactions are executed  and recorded properly so  as to ensure that  the
financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements.
 
     Elements  of these control systems  are the establishment and communication
of accounting  and administrative  policies and  procedures, the  selection  and
training of qualified personnel, and continuous programs of internal audits.
 
     The  Company's financial  statements are  reviewed by  its Audit Committee,
which is  composed  entirely of  non-employee  Directors. This  Committee  meets
periodically  with  the  independent  auditors,  management,  and  the corporate
internal auditor to review  the scope and results  of the annual audit,  interim
reviews,  internal controls, internal auditing, and financial reporting matters.
The independent auditors and the  corporate internal auditor have direct  access
to the Audit Committee.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
The Board of Directors
FIRST BRANDS CORPORATION:
 
     We  have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated balance  sheets  of First
Brands Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993 and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for  each
of  the years in the  three year period ended  June 30, 1994. These consolidated
financial statements are  the responsibility  of the  Company's management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.
 
     We conducted  our audits  in accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial statements  referred to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First Brands
Corporation and subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of  the years in the three year period
ended  June  30,  1994,  in   conformity  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles.
 
     As  discussed in Notes  1 and 12 to  the consolidated financial statements,
First Brands Corporation  changed its  method of  accounting for  postretirement
benefits  other  than pensions  by  adopting Statement  of  Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, 'Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions'.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
     The  accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
First Brands Corporation and subsidiaries ('First Brands' or the 'Company'). All
material intercompany  transactions and  balances  have been  eliminated.  First
Brands  engages in the development, manufacture,  marketing and sale of consumer
products sold  under  branded and  private  labels. Principal  branded  products
include:  GLAD (plastic  wrap/bags); PRESTONE (antifreeze/coolant  and other car
care products);  STP (oil  and  fuel additives  and other  specialty  automotive
products);  SIMONIZ (waxes and polishes) and SCOOP AWAY and EVER CLEAN (clumping
cat litters).
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGES
 
     Effective  July  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards (SFAS)  No. 106 'Employers'  Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other than Pensions'. SFAS No.  106 requires that companies accrue  the
projected  future cost  of providing  postretirement benefits  during the period
that employees render the services necessary  to be eligible for such  benefits.
While  the  adoption of  this  standard does  have  an impact  on  the Company's
reported net income,  it does  not impact First  Brand's cash  flow because  the
Company  intends  to  continue  its  current  practice  of  paying  the  cost of
postretirement benefits as incurred.  The Company has  elected to recognize  the
effect  of the change to SFAS No. 106 by amortizing the transition obligation of
$16,767,000 over 20 years (see Note 12).
 
     As of  July  1, 1992,  the  Company changed  its  basis of  accounting  for
domestic  inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. The Company's non-chemical costs have steadily declined
since its inception and chemical costs have declined for the past several years.
The Company expects that the non-chemical cost trends will continue and industry
forecasters predict  that the  chemicals  which the  Company purchases  will  be
priced  within a narrow range  over the next few  years. Based on these factors,
the Company believes that  the FIFO method of  accounting for these  inventories
provides a better matching of inventory costs with product sales. The change has
been  applied retroactively by  restating financial statements  prior to July 1,
1992. The effect of this restatement was to reduce retained earnings as of  June
30, 1992 by $15,787,000.
 
     During fiscal 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 'Accounting for Income
Taxes'. SFAS No. 109 requires a change from the deferred method to the asset and
liability  method of accounting  for income taxes. The  Company adopted SFAS No.
109 by  retroactively restating  the  financial statements  for years  prior  to
fiscal 1993. The effect of this restatement was to increase retained earnings as
of June 30, 1992 by $14,918,000 (see Note 11).

OPERATIONS RESTRUCTURING
 
     During  fiscal  1992, the  Company announced  that  most of  the production
operations at its East  Hartford, Connecticut wrap and  bag facility were  being
phased  out. A provision of $4,500,000 was made to cover the cost of removal and
transfer of  the machinery  and equipment,  as well  as employee  severance  and
relocation  costs. The Company completed the shutdown of this facility in fiscal
1993.
 
INVENTORIES
 
     Inventories are stated at the lower  of cost or market. Cost is  determined
for financial reporting purposes using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for
substantially all inventories in the United States. In general, the average cost
or FIFO method is used by the international operations.
 
     Inventories were comprised of the following as of June 30, 1994 and 1993:

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
 
     Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  carried  at  cost.  Expenditures for
replacements are  capitalized and  the replaced  assets are  retired. Gains  and
losses  from the sale and/or disposal  of property are included in 'Amortization
and other depreciation'.  Depreciation is  calculated on  a straight-line  basis
over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  respective  assets  for accounting
purposes. The Company capitalizes interest on major fixed asset additions during
construction. Interest capitalized  totalled $1,120,000 in  1994, $1,078,000  in
1993 and $2,846,000 in 1992.

4. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
 
     The  recoverability of carrying values of intangible assets is evaluated on
a recurring  basis. The  primary  indicators of  recoverability are  current  or
forecasted  profitability of the  related acquired business,  measured as profit
before interest, but  after amortization  of the intangible  assets compared  to
their  carrying values. For the three-year period  ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and
1992 there  were no  adjustments to  the carrying  values of  intangible  assets
resulting from these evaluations.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     During  fiscal 1994,  certain of  the Company's  international subsidiaries
entered into foreign  exchange contracts to  limit the impact  of exchange  rate
fluctuations  on their  U.S. dollar purchase  commitments. All  gains and losses
associated with these  transactions are  included in  the basis  of the  related
hedge  transaction. At  June 30,  1994, the  Company had  $10,000,000 in foreign
exchange contracts outstanding, all  of which will mature  during the first  two
quarters of fiscal 1995.
 
     The Company entered into an interest rate swap to transform long term fixed
rate debt into current variable obligations. The notional amount of the contract
is  $50,000,000 and will mature in 1997.  This transaction allows the Company to
better balance its interest rate exposure. At June 30, 1994 fair market value of
this swap agreement approximates book value.
 
     Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
notes receivable, notes payable, accounts payable and long-term debt. Because of
the  short-term  nature  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
receivable,  notes payable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates
fair value. The fair value of fixed  rate debt is estimated using market  rates.
At  June 30, 1994,  the fair value  of the Company's  long-term debt exceeds the
carrying value by approximately $9,000,000.

</TABLE>
 
     (a) On  June  2,  1994,  the Company  amended  it's  credit  facility  (the
'Revolving  Credit Facility') to  extend the agreement  an additional six months
until December  of  1995. The  Revolving  Credit Facility  has  no  compensating
balance  requirements,  however it  does  have restrictive  covenants,  the most
significant of which include the maintenance  of certain minimum levels for  the
ratio  of current assets to current liabilities, interest coverage and the ratio
of total liabilities to equity.
 
     During fiscal  1992, the  Company  purchased certain  equipment  previously
subject  to a sale and leaseback (see Note 9), and financed such purchase with a
$47,589,000 10 year Term Loan. The Term Loan required equal quarterly  principal
and  interest payments beginning on March 1,  1992, subject to any prepayment of
principal. On March 1,  1994 and March 2,  1992 the Company prepaid  $20,000,000
and  $4,759,000, respectively, of the  Term Loan principal, and  on June 1, 1994
the Company prepaid the remaining balance of $10,933,000.
 
     (b)  During  fiscal  1992,  the  Company  repurchased  $15,000,000  of  its
Subordinated  Notes at 103% of the principal  amount, and all of the outstanding
$255,040,000 of its Senior Subordinated Debentures at prices ranging from 105.6%
to 106.1% of the principal amount.  The premium and unamortized issuance  costs,
net of taxes, relating to the repurchased debt are reflected as an extraordinary
loss on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
     The 9 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes (the '9 1/8% Notes') are redeemable at
the  option of the Company  on or after April  1, 1997 at par  and become due in
1999. Proceeds from  the sale of  the 9 1/8%  Notes were used  to redeem a  like
amount of the 12 1/2% Debentures during fiscal 1992.
 
     The  13  1/4%  Subordinated  Note Purchase  Agreement  (the  'Note Purchase
Agreement') requires the  principal amount  to be paid  in annual  installments,
subject to reduction for prior repurchases, of $9,000,000 on July 1, 1997 and on
each  July 1 thereafter through the year 2001. On March 27, 1991, the holders of
the 13 1/4% Notes sold the remainder of the Company's common stock held by them.
As a result,  they may  require the  Company to  prepay at  par the  outstanding
balance  of the 13 1/4% Notes in accordance  with a formula in the Note Purchase
Agreement on a date not earlier than  15 months from the date the holders  elect
to  require  such prepayment,  however, this  is subject  to limitations  in the
Revolving Credit Facility.
 
     The 9 1/8% Notes contain limitations of the Company's right to incur  debt.
Additionally,  both the 9  1/8% Notes Indenture and  the Note Purchase Agreement
have restrictive covenants or limitations on

the payment of dividends, the distribution of capital stock or the redeeming  of
capital  stock,  as  well as  limitations  on  Company and  subsidiary  debt and
limitations on the sale of assets. The amount of unrestricted Retained  Earnings
available  to pay dividends was $134,394,000 at  June 30, 1994. First Brands was
in compliance  with  all the  covenants  of  the senior  and  subordinated  debt
agreements at June 30, 1994.
 
     Principal  payments due  on long-term  debt (including  current maturities)
will require the following future  payments: $48,000 in fiscal 1995,  $3,774,000
in  fiscal 1996, $98,000 in fiscal 1997, $9,100,000 in fiscal 1998, $109,103,000
in fiscal 1999 and $31,355,000 thereafter.
 
9. LEASES
 
     The Company has entered into several agreements for the sale and  leaseback
of  substantially all of the production equipment at two of its domestic plastic
wrap and bag plants and  a majority of the  GLAD-LOCK equipment at its  Amherst,
Virginia  facility.  The  Company  has purchase  and  lease  renewal  options at
projected future  fair  market  values  under the  agreements.  The  leases  are
classified  as  operating  leases  in accordance  with  the  FASB  Statement No.
13 -- Accounting for Leases.
 
     The book values of the  equipment totalling $160,823,000 have been  removed
from  the  balance  sheet,  and  the gains  realized  on  the  sale transactions
totalling $13,515,000 have  been deferred and  are being credited  to income  as
rent  expense adjustments over the lease terms. To obtain more favorable leasing
term, the Company renegotiated certain lease agreements during fiscal 1994.  The
average yearly rental for all equipment leases is $19,447,000.
 
     Restrictive  covenants under the  lease agreements are  similar to the bank
credit facility described in Note 7. The Company was in compliance with all  the
covenants of the lease agreements at June 30, 1994.
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain operating leases for various
warehouses,  office facilities and equipment generally over periods ranging from
one to five years with options to renew.
 
     Lease commitments under  noncancelable operating leases  extending for  one
year  or more will  require the following future  payments: $24,545,000 in 1995,
$23,981,000 in 1996,  $20,621,000 in  1997, $12,293,000 in  1998, $4,665,000  in
1999 and $349,000 thereafter. The total lease and rental expense under operating
leases was $25,895,000, $28,033,000 and $29,128,000, respectively, for the years
ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992.
 
10. CAPITAL STOCK
 
     The  Company  has established  a long-term  incentive plan  (the 'Incentive
Plan') under  which  awards  of  incentive  stock  options,  nonqualified  stock
options,  restricted and  limited stock  appreciation rights  may be  granted to
certain key employees of the Company. Stock options granted under the  Incentive
Plan  will have a term not in excess  of ten years. The exercise price for stock
options will not be less than the fair  market value of the Common Stock on  the
date  of  grant and  such  options will  vest over  a  period determined  by the
Compensation Committee. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which could
be granted under the Incentive Plan at June 30, 1994 was 1,405,000.

     The  current portion  of deferred  tax assets for  fiscal 1994  and 1993 is
$26,239,000  and  $23,413,000,  respectively.  Management  of  the  Company  has
determined,  based on the  Company's history of  prior years' operating earnings
and its expected income for the  future, that operating income will more  likely
than  not  be sufficient  to fully  utilize  these deferred  tax assets  as they
mature.
 
     The Company has not provided for Federal income taxes on the  undistributed
income  of its international subsidiaries because  it is the Company's intention
to reinvest  such undistributed  income. Cumulative  undistributed earnings  for
which no U.S tax has been provided were $34,834,000, $33,599,000 and $31,786,000
for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 respectively.
 
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
SAVINGS PLAN
 
     The  Company currently maintains a savings  plan to which it contributes to
the account of each eligible employee who chooses to participate, 10, 20 or  30%
of  the amount  contributed by  the employee  in the  form of  basic deductions,
depending on length of service. Any regular  employee with one or more years  of
credited  service with  First Brands is  eligible to participate  in the Savings
Plan. Savings plan expense  for the years  ending June 30,  1994, 1993 and  1992
totalled $1,042,000, $1,189,000 and $1,172,000, respectively.
 
PENSION PLAN
 
     The  retirement plan for First Brands  and its subsidiaries provide defined
benefits  that  are  based  on  years  of  credited  service,  highest   average
compensation  (as defined) and the primary social security benefit. Pension plan
assets are primarily comprised  of corporate equities as  well as corporate  and
government  fixed income obligations.  Contributions to the  plan are based upon
the projected  unit credit  actuarial cost  funding method  and are  limited  to
amounts that are currently deductible for tax reporting purposes.
 
     The  operations  restructuring  program which  the  Company  implemented in
fiscal 1992  resulted in  a decrease  in  the number  of participants  in  First
Brands' pension program. As a result of this reduction, the Company recognized a
pension curtailment gain of $1,361,000 during fiscal 1993.

     The weighted average discount rate and the rate of increase in compensation
used in  determining the  actuarial  present value  of the  accumulated  benefit
obligation  was 8.0% in  1994 and 9.0%  in 1993 and  1992; and 4.5%  in 1994 and
4.75% in 1993 and 1992,  respectively, for the U.S.  For the Canadian plan,  the
weighted  average discount rate and the rate of increase for 1994, 1993 and 1992
was 8.5%  and 5%,  respectively. The  related rate  of expected  return on  plan
assets in the U.S. was 8.0% in 1994 and 9.0% in 1993 and 1992; and in Canada was
8.5% in 1994, 1993 and 1992.
 
     For  Federal income tax purposes,  the amount of benefits  that can be paid
from a qualified  plan is restricted.  Effective January 1,  1993, First  Brands
established  a  nonqualified plan  ('Executive Retirement  Plan') the  effect of
which is to award retirement benefits to  all employees on a uniform basis.  The
Executive  Retirement Plan is  unfunded. Prior to January  1, 1993, First Brands
maintained a nonqualified  excess benefit  plan to continue  the calculation  of
benefits   after  retirement  for  employees  who  are  restricted  due  to  IRS
regulations, and a nonqualified retirement plan which provided retirement income
based on amounts earned through the annual incentive plan for certain  corporate
and division officers. During 1994, 1993 and 1992, expense of $225,000, $307,000
and  $440,000, respectively, has been reflected  for these plans. Funding of the
nonqualified excess benefit and retirement plans for 1993 and 1992 were $342,000
and  $855,000,  respectively.  The  funds  in  the  trust  were  distributed  to
participating employees at December 31, 1992.
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     In  addition to  providing pension  benefits, the  Company provides certain
medical and life  insurance benefits for  retirees and their  dependents in  the
United  States.  Employees who  have reached  the age  of 55,  and have  met the
Company's minimum service requirements, become eligible for these benefits.  The
medical  and  life insurance  benefits available  are partially  contributory in
nature, and it is the Company's

practice to fund these benefits as incurred. Retirees outside the United  States
are generally covered by locally sponsored government programs.
 
     Postretirement  benefit costs for 1994  were $2,528,000, which is comprised
of $381,000 for service costs, $1,307,000 for interest cost and $840,000 for the
amortization of  the  transition obligation.  Prior  to adopting  SFAS  No.  106
postretirement  benefits  were expensed  as claims  were  paid, and  amounted to
$646,000 and $394,000 for 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
     The Company's  accumulated postretirement  benefit obligation  at June  30,
1994 is comprised of the following components:

declining 1% per year after fiscal year 1995 to an ultimate rate of 7% in fiscal
year 2001. A 1%  increase in the  assumed health care cost  trend rate for  each

30,  1994 by  $785,000 and increase  the service  and interest cost  for 1994 by
$120,000.
 
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The  Company  and  Prestone  Technology   Systems  Inc.,  a  wholly   owned
subsidiary,  have been named  as defendant in  a suit brought  by American Fluid
Technologies ('AFT') and as a co-defendant with AFT in suits brought by two  AFT
franchisees  in connection with its  mobile recycling antifreeze technology. The
suits are in  the early stages  of discovery,  and valuation of  the claims  are
pending  further discovery, although the alleged claims are not expected to have
a material adverse  effect on  the Company's  financial position  or results  of
operations.  The Company has not transferred  liability, if any, for these suits
to Prestone Products.
 
     The Company has  been named  as defendant in  various claims  arising as  a
normal part of its business, including three pending lawsuits involving STP Flat
Tire  Repair which was recalled in January, 1994 as a result of concerns for the
products safety arising from its misuse. Based upon the facts available to date,
management believes the Company  has meritorious defenses  to all these  actions
and  that the ultimate  resolution of these  actions and claims  will not have a
material adverse  effect  on the  Company's  financial position  or  results  of
operations.
 
OTHER
 
     Pursuant   to  the  acquisition  agreement,  the  Company  assumed  certain
liabilities of Union Carbide, including most environmental liabilities connected
with the acquisition of  the worldwide home and  automotive businesses of  Union
Carbide  at the inception of the Company.  To the extent that the Company incurs
environmental liabilities which relate to  conditions existing or actions  taken
prior  to the closing date or which relate to compliance with any requirement of
an environmental  law  or  regulation  which  existed as  of  the  date  of  the
acquisition agreement, the Company will be entitled to
 
                                       34

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
indemnification  from Union  Carbide for  85% of  such liabilities  in excess of
$10,000,000 (providing such liabilities are asserted and written notice of  such
assertion  is given to Union Carbide within three years of the closing date), up
to aggregate expenditures  by Union  Carbide for such  liabilities (and  certain
other  liabilities specified in the acquisition agreement) of $75,000,000. Based
upon the facts available to  date, while the Company  does not believe that  its
liability  will exceed the liability established at the acquisition date, it has
notified Union Carbide  that the  amount may exceed  the $10,000,000  liability,
thereby triggering Union Carbide's indemnification.
 
     The  Company is a party to a  contract with Union Carbide that provides for
the purchase of  a substantial  portion of  the Company's  primary raw  material
requirements for plastic wrap and bags through December 31, 1994. The Company is
also  a party to a contract with Union Carbide that provides for the purchase of
a substantial portion  of the  Company's primary raw  material requirements  for
antifreeze/coolant  through December 31,  1996. The Company  has other long-term
contracts with several other  suppliers for substantially  all of its  remaining
requirements  of raw materials  for antifreeze/coolant. In  the past, certain of
the Company's raw materials supply contracts were not necessarily responsive  to
market  conditions and, therefore, resulted from time to time in higher or lower
prices for the  relevant raw  materials than the  prices paid  by the  Company's
competitors.  The pricing provisions  in the Company's  present supply contracts
are designed  to  be  responsive  to  market  conditions  of  the  relevant  raw
materials.
 
14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
     Alan  C. Egler, a director of the  Company, was retained as a consultant to
the Company during fiscal 1992, for which he received fees of $99,000.
 
     The Company paid underwriting fees, net  of expenses, of $1,700,000 to  The
First  Boston Corporation, of  which Mr. Maher,  a director of  the Company, was
Vice Chairman, in connection  with the issuance  of the 9  1/8% Notes in  March,
1992.
 
     The  Company believes that each of the related party transactions described
herein were on terms  as fair to  the Company as could  have been obtained  from
unaffiliated third parties.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     U.S.  Export Sales totalled $31,096,000, $34,021,000 and $30,215,000 during
the years ended June  30, 1994, 1993, and  1992, respectively. The Company  does
not  believe that it is dependent on  any single customer, however, sales to its
largest customer in the year ended June 30, 1994, amounted to approximately  14%
of total sales.
 
16. ACQUISITION -- A&M PRODUCTS
 
     On  May 22, 1992, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of A&M Pet
Products, Inc.  ('A&M'), for  approximately  $55,000,000. A&M  manufactures  and
markets  SCOOP AWAY and  EVER CLEAN, the  leading brands of  clumping cat litter
products in the United States.
 
     The acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  by  the  purchase  method,  and
accordingly,  the results  of operations  of A&M  are included  in the Company's
Consolidated Statement of  Income from the  date of acquisition.  The excess  of
cost  over net assets acquired is being amortized  over a forty year period on a
straight line basis. Pro forma information  with respect to this acquisition  is
not  presented,  because the  results of  operations of  A&M are  not considered
material to historical results of operations.
 
17. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
 
     In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS  No.
112, 'Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits', which the Company will
adopt  in the first quarter of fiscal 1995. SFAS No. 112 concerns those benefits
provided by an  employer to former  or inactive employees  after employment  but
before retirement. The Company has generally recognized the cost of benefits for
these former and inactive employees when claims were paid. SFAS No. 112 requires
that  the expense  associated with  these benefits  be recognized  on an accrual
basis. The Company believes that  the adoption of SFAS No.  112 will not have  a
material impact on its consolidated financial position.
 
18. SUBSEQUENT EVENT -- ACQUISITION OF EXCEL
 
     On July 13, 1994, the Company purchased substantially all of the equipment,
inventory,  materials and supplies of Excel-Mineral Inc. and Excel International
Inc., a manufacturer and marketer  of the JONNY CAT  brand of cat care  products
for  approximately $45,000,000.  For the  fiscal year  ended December  31, 1993,
Excel reported net  sales of  approximately $39,000,000.  Pro forma  information
with  respect  to this  acquisition  is not  presented,  because the  results of
operations of  Excel  are  not  considered material  to  historical  results  of
operations.
 
19. SUBSEQUENT EVENT -- SALE OF PRESTONE
 
     On  August 26, 1994, First Brands  sold the PRESTONE antifreeze/coolant and
car care  business to  Prestone Products  Corporation, a  company organized  and
controlled   by  Vestar  Capital  Partners,   a  private  investment  firm,  for
$142,000,000 in cash and $13,000,000  7 1/2% subordinated debenture maturing  in
2003,  which for financial statement purposes  has been valued at $9,000,000. In
consideration for this  purchase price, Vestar/Freeze  Holdings acquired  assets
and   assumed  liabilities   of  approximately   $124,000,000  and  $31,000,000,
respectively. The Company is in the process of finalizing its calculation of the
gain on the sale.
 
     The following table presents certain financial information of the  Prestone
business:

                   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON SCHEDULES
 
The Board of Directors
FIRST BRANDS CORPORATION:
 
     The  audits referred to  in our report  dated August 9,  1994 (except as to

basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.
 
     Our  report refers to the Company's change in its method for accounting for
postretirement benefits other than  pensions as described in  Notes 1 and 12  to

                                       51
 
<PAGE>
     This  Agreement,  dated  as  of  December  1,  1993,  amending  the Leasing
Agreement, dated as of November 16, 1993 (the 'Lease'), by and between  Citicorp
North  America, Inc.  (formerly known as  Citicorp Industrial  Credit, Inc.), as
lessor (hereinafter called  'Lessor'), and First  Brands Corporation, as  lessee
(hereinafter called 'Lessee').
 
     In  consideration of the  mutual covenants hereinafter  contained and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is  hereby
acknowledged, Lessor and Lessee hereby agree as follows:
 
          1.  The  second sentence  of Subsection  9(a) of  the Lease  is hereby
     deleted and the following sentence is hereby inserted therefor:
 
             'All Partial Lease Terminations,  subject to the Maximum  Aggregate
        Termination Amount, shall be treated as an event of loss pursuant to the
        provisions of Section 10 hereof.'
 
          2.  Subsection 9(c) of the Lease is hereby deleted in its entirety and
     the following Subsection (c) is hereby inserted therefor:
 
             '(c) Termination Pursuant  to a  Sale. In arranging  a Total  Lease
        Termination  by sale  pursuant to this  Section 9, Lessee  shall use its
        best efforts to obtain sale proceeds not less than the Fair Market Value
        of all of the Items.  If Lessor and Lessee  cannot agree upon such  Fair
        Market Value they shall utilize the Appraisal Procedure to determine the
        Fair  Market Value. If  the proposed sale price  specified in the notice
        referred to  in  Section  9(b)  hereof is  less  than  the  Unguaranteed
        Residual  with respect to all of the  Items, Lessee shall not proceed to
        sell such  Items until  it has  received the  consent of  Lessor,  which
        consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
             In  connection  with a  Total  Lease Termination  pursuant  to this
        Section 9(c), Lessee shall  make a payment to  Lessor on the  applicable
        Termination  Date in a sum equal to  (i) the Proceeds of Sale, plus (ii)
        Additional Rent, if any,  plus (iii) the Economic  Payment, if any.  The
        lease  of all of the Items and Lessee's obligation to pay Rent hereunder
        shall continue until  such payment  is received by  Lessor, or  Lessor's
        assignee,  and shall thereupon terminate. If the Proceeds of Sale of all
        of the Items are less  than the Unamortized Value  of such Items at  the
        time  of the termination of the lease hereunder, but equal to or greater
        than the Unguaranteed Residual, Lessee shall forthwith pay as Additional
        Rent an  amount  equal to  the  difference  between the  amount  of  the
        Proceeds  of Sale and such Unamortized Value. If the Proceeds of Sale of
        all of the Items are less  than the Unguaranteed Residual, Lessee  shall
        at  the  same time  pay Lessor  as Additional  Rent a  sum equal  to the
        Unamortized Value of such Items less the Unguaranteed Residual, plus any
        Contingent Rent due for the Items; provided, however, that the amount of
        any Contingent Rent due will not be greater than the amount by which the
        Unguaranteed Residual exceeds such Proceeds of Sale. If the Proceeds  of
        Sale  of all of the Items are greater than the Unamortized Value of such
        Items at the time of the termination of the lease hereunder, Lessor,  in
        consideration  of Lessee's  agreement hereunder to  repair, maintain and
        insure the Equipment, shall  as an adjustment of  Rent forthwith pay  to
        Lessee or, at the option of Lessee, credit Lessee's account in an amount
        equal  to  the  difference  between  said  Proceeds  of  Sale  and  said
        Unamortized Value,  subject, however,  to satisfaction  of the  Economic
        Payment.  If for any quarter funds are payable by Lessor to Lessee under
        this Section 9(c), the amount so payable may be deducted by Lessee  from
        funds  payable  during  the  same  quarter by  Lessee  for  Rent  of the
        Equipment.'
 
          3. The portion of the third sentence of Subsection 10(a) of the  Lease
     preceding  Subsection  (k)  thereof  is hereby  deleted  and  the following
     language is hereby inserted therefor:
 
             'In the  event of  total destruction  of any  of the  Equipment  or
        damage beyond repair or the commandeering, conversion or other such loss
        of  any of the Equipment, or if the use thereof by Lessee in its regular
        course of  business is  prevented by  the  act of  any third  person  or
        persons,  or any Governmental  Authority, for a  period exceeding ninety
        (90) days, or if any of the Equipment is attached (other than on a claim
        against  Lessor  but  not  Lessee)  or  is  seriously  damaged  and  the
        attachment is not removed or the Equipment not repaired, as the case may
        be,  in a period of ninety (90) days or if the Equipment is subject to a
        Partial Lease
 
                                       52

        Termination pursuant to Section 9(a) (an  `event of loss'), then in  any
        such event and subject to the provisions of Section 10(be) hereof:'
 
          4. This Agreement shall be effective as of December 1, 1993.
 
          5. Except as hereinabove set forth, all of the terms and conditions of
     the Lease shall remain in full force and effect.
 
     IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and  Lessee, through their authorized officers,
have duly executed this Rider No. 1 as of the day and year first above written.

     This  Agreement, dated as of May  11, 1994, amending the Leasing Agreement,
dated as  of November  16, 1993  and as  amended by  Rider No.  1, dated  as  of
December  1, 1993  (the 'Lease'),  by and  between Citicorp  North America, Inc.
(formerly known as  Citicorp Industrial  Credit, Inc.),  as lessor  (hereinafter
called  'Lessor'), and First  Brands Corporation, as  lessee (hereinafter called
'Lessee').
 
     In consideration of  the mutual covenants  hereinafter contained and  other
good  and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, Lessor and Lessee hereby agree as follows:
 
          1. The definition of 'LIBO Rate' contained in Appendix A to the  Lease
     is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefor:
 
             'LIBO  Rate' shall mean, for each Rent Period during a LIBO Period,
        the rate  per  annum  (rounded  upward, if  necessary,  to  the  nearest
        integral multiple of one one-hundredth of one percent (1/100%)) equal to
        the  quotient of (i) the rate of interest per annum at which deposits in
        U.S. Dollars in  immediately available  funds are  offered to  Citibank,
        N.A. two (2) Business Days prior to the beginning of such LIBO Period by
        prime  banks in  the interbank  Eurodollar market  as at  or about 10:00
        a.m., New York City  time, for delivery  on the first  day of such  LIBO
        Period  for a period equal  to the number of  months in such LIBO Period
        and in an amount equal to the Unamortized Value as of such date, divided
        by (ii) the  remainder of one  (1) minus the  decimal equivalent of  the
        applicable LIBO Rate Reserve Percentage.
 
          2.  The following definition  is hereby inserted to  Appendix A to the
     Lease:
 
             'LIBO Period' means a period of three, six, nine or twelve  months,
        as selected by Lessee by written notice to Lessor at least five Business
        Days  prior to  the end  of the  then current  LIBO Period;  provided if
        Lessee fails to timely  select a LIBO Period,  Lesse shall be deemed  to
        have selected a LIBO Period of three months; provided, further, however,
        that  the expiration of  the last LIBO Period  selected by Lessee during
        the fourth Renewal Term must coincide with the expiration of the  fourth
        Renewal Term.
 
          3. the definition of 'Alternative Rate' contained in Appendix A to the
     Lease  is  hereby  deleted  in  its  entirety  and  the  following inserted
     therefor:
 
             'Alternative Rate' shall mean, in  the event that Lessee selects  a
        LIBO Period equal to (i) three months, the Federal Composite AA Index of
        3-Month Dealer-Placed Commercial Paper (published by the Federal Reserve
        System), plus 10 basis points, (ii) six months, the Federal Composite AA
        Index  of  6-Month  Dealer-Placed  Commercial  Paper  (published  by the
        Federal Reserve System), plus  15 basis points,  (iii) nine months,  the
        Federal  Composite AA  Index of  6-Month Dealer-Placed  Commercial Paper
        (published by the  Federal Reserve  System), plus 28  basis points,  and
        (iv)  twelve months, the  Treasury Constant Maturities  Index for 1-Year
        (published by  the  Federal  Reserve  System),  plus  33  basis  points;
        provided,  that the Alternative  Rate shall only  be the applicable rate
        hereunder if Lessor  determines in its  sole discretion that  reasonable
        means  do  not  exist  for ascertaining  the  applicable  LIBO  Rate and
        notifies Lessee of such determination as soon as practicable thereafter.
 
          4. The  last  two  lines  of the  definition  of  'LIBO  Rate  Reserve
     Percentage:  contained in  Appendix A  to the  Lease are  hereby deleted in
     their entirety and the following inserted therefor:
 
             'having a term equal to the number of months in the applicable LIBO
        Period.'
 
          5. The definition  of 'Break  Costs' contained  in Appendix  A to  the
     Lease  is hereby amended to add the following at the end of such definition
     prior to the period:
 
             ', in either case, which Date is also the first Business Day  after
        the LIBO period during which such option was exercised'.
 
          6. This Agreement shall be effective as of May 11, 1994.
 
          7. Except as hereinabove set forth, all of the terms and conditions of
     the Lease shall remain in full force and effect.
