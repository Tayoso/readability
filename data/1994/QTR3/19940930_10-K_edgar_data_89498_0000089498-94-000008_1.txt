                                  PART I



Item I.  Business

     Shaw Industries, Inc. ("Shaw" or the "Company") is the world's
largest carpet manufacturer.  Shaw designs and manufactures
approximately 1,600 styles of tufted and woven carpet for
residential and commercial use under the PHILADELPHIA, TRUSTMARK, CABIN
CRAFTS, SHAW COMMERCIAL CARPETS, STRATTON, NETWORX, SHAWMARK, EVANS
BLACK, SALEM,  SUTTON, KOSSET, CROSSLEY, ABINGDON, REDBOOK,
MINSTER, INVICTA and TERZA trade names and under certain private
labels.  The Company's manufacturing operations are fully
integrated from the processing of yarns through the finishing of
carpet.  The Company's carpet is sold in a broad range of prices,
patterns, colors and textures with the majority of its sales in the
medium to high retail price range.  Shaw sells its products to
retailers, distributors and commercial users throughout the United
States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and the United Kingdom and, to a
lesser degree, exports to additional overseas markets.

     On July 12, 1993, the Company formed a joint venture through
which it acquired an interest in Capital Carpet Industries, Pty.,
Ltd., Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and Invicta Group Industries,
Pty., Ltd., Braybrook, Victoria, Australia (together, "CCI"),
enabling the Company to participate in a government-supported rationalization
of the Australian carpet industry. On November 4, 1993, the Company acquired
the remaining interest in the joint venture.  Until November 4, 1993,
the investment was accounted for using the equity method, and accordingly,
the Company included its share of CCI's income in other income.  Subsequent
to November 4, 1993, the results of operations of CCI are included in
the Company's consolidated financial statements.

     On September 10, 1993, the Company acquired Abingdon Carpets,
Gwent, Wales.  Abingdon is a British producer of medium-priced
tufted carpets and carpet yarns.  The acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase transaction, and accordingly, the
results of operations of Abingdon are included in the Company's
consolidated financial statements since September 10, 1993.

     On May 31, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement to form
a joint venture with Grupo Industrial Alfa, S.A. de C.V. of
Monterrey, Mexico, for the manufacture, distribution and marketing
of carpets, rugs and related products in Mexico and South America.
The Company acquired a fify-one percent interest in Terza, S.A. de
C.V., and accordingly, the subsidiary is included in consolidation
at July 2, 1994 and the results of operations of Terza are included
in the Company's consolidated financial statements since May 31, 1994.

     Geographical information about the Company's sales, operating
profit and identifiable assets is incorporated by reference to page

                               1<PAGE>

19 of Exhibit 13 to this report.  The results of the acquired
operations in fiscal 1994 did not have a material effect on the
Company's net income.

Products and Marketing

     Substantially all carpet manufactured by the Company is tufted
carpet made from nylon and polypropylene yarn.  In the tufting
process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic
backing, forming loops which may be cut or left uncut, depending on
the desired texture or construction.  According to industry
estimates, tufted carpet accounted for over 91% of unit volume
shipments of carpet manufactured in the United States during
calendar 1993.  Substantially all carpet manufactured in the United
States is made from synthetic fibers, with nylon accounting for
65.2% of the total, polypropylene 24.9%, polyester 9.4% and wool
0.5%.  During fiscal 1994, the Company  processed approximately 95%
of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own yarn processing facilities.

     The Company believes that its significant investment in
modern, state-of-the-art equipment has been an important factor in
achieving and maintaining its leadership position in the
marketplace.  During the past five fiscal years, the Company has
invested approximately $782 million in property additions.  The
Company continually seeks opportunities for increasing its sales
volume and market share.  For example, the Company continues to
expand its product lines of carpet manufactured from polypropylene
fiber, including fibers produced by the Company's own extrusion
equipment.  The Company also has a manufacturing facility for the
production of carpet tiles for the commercial market.

     The overall level of sales in the carpet industry is
influenced by a number of factors, including consumer confidence
and spending for durable goods, interest rates, turnover in
housing, the condition of the residential construction industry and
the overall strength of the economy.

     The marketing of carpet is influenced significantly by current
trends in style and fashion, principally color trends.  The Company
believes it has been a leader in the development of color
technology in the carpet industry and that its dyeing facilities
are among the most modern and versatile in the industry.  The
Company maintains an in-house product development department to
identify developing color and style trends which are expected to
affect its customers' buying decisions.  In 1994 this department
was further strengthened by the completion of the Shaw Industries
Research and Development Center.  This state-of-the-art complex
includes a 75,000 square foot pilot plant featuring sample
extrusion, yarn processing, tufting, dyeing, coating and shearing
equipment, and three fiber and dye development laboratories.

                               2<PAGE>

Sales and Distribution

     The Company's products are marketed domestically by
approximately 1,050 salaried sales personnel in its various
marketing divisions directly to retailers and distributors and to
large national accounts through the Company's National Accounts
Division.  The Company's ten (10) regional customer service centers
and six (6) redistribution centers, along with its centralized
management information system, enable it to provide prompt delivery
of its products to both its retail customers and wholesale
distributors.  The Company's substantial investment in management
information systems permits efficient production scheduling and
control of inventory levels.

     The Company sells to approximately 37,250 retailers and
national accounts located throughout the United States and Canada.
Retailers and national accounts, on a combined basis, accounted for
approximately 86% of the Company's carpet sales for fiscal 1994.
Shaw also sells to approximately 100 wholesale distributors.
Approximately 4% of the Company's carpet sales in fiscal 1994 were
to distributors.  Sales of Shaw products in foreign markets,
including the sales of foreign subsidiaries, accounted for
approximately 10% of total sales in fiscal 1994.  No single
customer accounted for more than 2% of the Company's sales during
fiscal 1994.

Competition

     The carpet industry is highly competitive with more than 200
companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of carpet in the
United States.  Carpet manufacturers also face competition from the
hard surface floorcovering industry.  The principal methods of
competition within the carpet industry are quality, style, price
and service.  The Company believes its strategically located
regional customer service centers and redistribution centers
provide a competitive advantage to the Company by enabling it to
supply carpet on a timely basis to customers.  The Company's long-
standing practice in investing in modern, state-of-the-art
equipment contributes significantly to its ability to compete
effectively on the basis of quality, style and price.

Raw Materials

     The principal raw materials used by the Company are nylon
fiber and filament, and synthetic backing; additional raw materials
include polyester, polypropylene and wool fibers and filaments,
jute, latex and dye.  During fiscal 1994, the Company experienced
no significant shortages of raw materials.

Employees

     At July 2, 1994, the Company had approximately 24,200 full-

                               3<PAGE>

time employees.  In the opinion of management, employee relations
are good.  Employees are involved in the Quality Improvement
Process begun in 1985, a program designed to improve the Company's
products and services through education and training.  None of the
Company's employees in the United States are represented by unions.
Employees of foreign subsidiaries are represented by unions.

Environmental Matters

     Management believes the Company is currently in compliance in
all material respects with applicable federal, state and local
statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into
the environment and otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment.  Management does not believe the Company will be
required to expend any material amounts in order to remain in
compliance with these laws and regulations or that compliance will
materially affect its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position.

Patents, Trademarks, etc.

     Patent protection has not been significant to the Company's
business although the Company does hold several patents covering
machinery used in a specific carpet coloring process.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

    From time to time the Company is subject to claims and suits
arising in the course of its business.  In April 1993, the Company
became a defendant in certain litigation alleging personal injury
resulting from personal exposure to volatile organic compounds
found in carpet produced by the Company.  The complaints seek
injunctive relief and unspecified money damage on all claims.  The
Company has denied any liability.  In May 1993, the Company became
a defendant in certain litigation alleging violation of both
federal and state laws relating to unfair competition.  The
complaint seeks an injunction regarding the unfair competition
claims and money damages.  The Company has denied any liability.
The Company believes that is has meritorious defenses in these
suits and that the litigation will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations.  The Company will vigorously defend these suits.  In
June 1994, the Company and several other carpet manufacturers
received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice relating to an investigation of
the industry.  The Company believes that once this investigation is
completed it will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

    At the end of fiscal year 1994, there were no other pending
legal proceedings to which the Company was a party or to which any
of its property was subject which, in the opinion of management,
were likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition or results of operations.

                                                            EXHIBIT 10(b)

                          SHAW INDUSTRIES, INC.

                       DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

     The Board of Directors of Shaw Industries, Inc. (the "Company")
hereby recognizes that it is in the best interests of the Company to
provide incentive for highly compensated key employees to remain in
the employ of the Company, to reward such employees for outstanding
service and to provide a system of benefits that will assist the
Company to attract and retain the services of additional key
employees.  The Board of Directors hereby determines that in order to
achieve these goals, the Company should adopt a deferred compensation
plan to provide for the payment of benefits to certain key employees
selected by the Board of Directors upon their retirement, death or
disability, provided they have remained in the employ of the Company
until the occurrence of such an event.

     Consequently, the following deferred compensation plan (the
"Plan") is hereby approved and adopted.

     l.   Name of the Plan.  This Plan, as now enacted and as
          hereafter amended, shall be known as the Shaw Industries,
          Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan.

     2.   Purpose of Plan.  The purposes of the Plan are to retain
          the services of highly compensated key employees for the
          Company, to reward them for outstanding performances in the
          past, to encourage  them to continue to devote their full
          attention and efforts to the growth and profitability of the
          Company and to recruit new key employees for the Company.

     3.    Determination of Eligibility.  The Board of Directors of
          the Company, or its designated Compensation Committee, shall
          have the right to determine those key employees who shall be
          eligible to participate in the Plan.  The Board of Directors
          or such committee, which shall hereafter collectively be
          referred to as the "Board", shall have the further right and
          authority to enter into agreements with such designated
          employees pursuant to the Plan and to modify, alter or
          terminate such agreements with the consent or approval of
          the affected employees.

     4.   Amount of Benefits.  The Board shall have the sole and
          exclusive right to determine the amount of deferred
          compensation to be paid to any designated employee pursuant
          to the Plan; however, unless specifically approved by a
          majority of the members of the Board of Directors (excluding
          the votes of any members of the Board who may be
          beneficiaries of such a proposal), the maximum amount
          payable to any employee under this plan (the "Benefit
          Amount") shall not exceed twice the Annual Benefit Amount as
          defined.<PAGE>

          Unless otherwise specified by the Board, the Annual Benefit
          Amount shall be equal to the average of the three highest
          years of income for the designated employee for the last
          five years prior to retirement, death or total disability.

     5.   Payment of Benefits.  The Board shall determine the
          appropriate method of payment for each employee under the
          Plan, but the typical method of payment shall constitute
          payment of the aggregate Benefit Amount in 120 equal monthly
          installments over the 10 year period following the
          employee's death, retirement or total disability.  The Board
          is hereby specifically authorized, in its discretion, to
          negotiate for a more rapid payment, on a discounted basis,
          if it determines that such an accelerated method of payment
          is in the best interests of the Company and the employee.

          The basis and amount of any discount shall be determined by
          the Board, in its discretion, subject to the agreement of
          the employee or his designated beneficiary, executors, heirs
          or personal representatives.

     6.   Early Retirement.  Upon the mutual agreement of an employee
          participating in the Plan and the Board, such an employee
          who elects to take early retirement may receive benefits
          under the Plan on such terms as the Board and such employee
          may determine.

     7.   Forfeiture of Benefits.  Benefits to be received by
          designated employees under the Plan are forfeitable.  In the
          event that the employee should at any time voluntarily
          resign from the Company or be terminated for cause (as
          defined), all benefits payable to such employee under the
          Plan shall immediately terminate and the Company shall have
          no obligation to pay any amounts under this Plan to such
          employee.  As used in this Plan and in any agreement between
          the Company and designated employee, the term "cause" shall
          mean acts of gross negligence or willful or wanton disregard
          for duties; conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude;
          or the commission or omission of any other acts deemed by
          the Board to be inimical to the best interest of the
          Company.  The determination of "cause" shall be made solely
          by the Board, in its exclusive discretion, and its
          determination shall be final and binding.

     8.   Method of Funding.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall
          create any obligation on the part of the Company to fund its
          obligations under this Plan or to establish a separate or
          segregated fund for its obligations under this Plan.

     9.   Evidence of Agreement.  The Company and each designated
          employee shall enter into an agreement containing the terms
          of the Plan as set forth above and such other terms and
          conditions as the Board shall deem necessary or appropriate.


    10.   Termination.  The Board shall have the right to amend,
          modify or terminate this Plan at any time in its sole
          discretion.<PAGE>

               act or omission determined by the Board of
               Directors to be inimical to the best interests
               of Shaw.  The determination of cause shall be
               made by the Board, solely in its discretion,and
               its determination shall be final and binding.<PAGE>

               or persons specified as beneficiary or
               beneficiaries by the Employee in writing to

               beneficiary or all beneficiaries shall not be
               alive, the term Designated Beneficiary shall
               mean the estate of the deceased Employee acting

               representative.

          (e)  "Determination Date" shall mean the earlier of:

               determination of total disability (as herein
               defined) by the Board of Directors of Shaw or

          (f)  "Benefit Period".  Unless otherwise specified
               herein, the Benefit Period shall mean the ten
               year period commencing with the first day of

               resolution by the Board of Directors of Shaw
               whose decision shall be final and binding.
               Employee hereby consents to be examined by such
               physicians as Shaw may request to assist Shaw
               in determining whether total disability has
               occurred.

    2.    Benefits.

          (a)  Retirement.  If the Employee shall continue in
               Shaw's employ until his normal retirement date
               established by Shaw then upon his normal
               retirement date, or such later date as the
               Employee shall actually retire, Shaw shall pay
               the Employee the Benefit Amount as herein
               defined during the Benefit Period as herein
               defined, commencing on the first day of the
               month next following his retirement and
               continuing on a monthly basis thereafter for a
               total of 120 monthly payments.  In the event of
               the Employee's death after retirement but prior
               to completion of the payment of the Benefit
               Amount, the remaining payments shall be paid to
               such person or persons as the Employee shall
               Save designated in writing to Shaw.<PAGE>

               During the Benefit Period, Employee shall, at
               Shaw's request, be available at mutually
               agreeable times to provide consultation and
               advice to Shaw, but Employee shall not be
               required to travel away from his residence for
               purposes of such consultation unless all
               expenses incurred by him are paid by Shaw.

               Also during the Benefit Period, without the
               prior consent of Shaw, Employee shall not
               offer his services as a consultant to any other
               carpet manufacturer or own more than ten
               percent of stock of or be employed in an
               executive capacity by any other carpet
               manufacturer which competes with Shaw.
               Payments to the Employee of the Benefit Amount
               are conditioned upon his fulfillment of these
               obligations and if Employee should materially
               breach any of the foregoing requirements, the
               Board of Directors of Shaw may suspend or
               eliminate any future payments.  The
               determination by the Board of Directors of Shaw
               of a material breach shall be final and
               conclusive.

          (b)  Total Disability.  In the event the Employee
               becomes totally disabled as herein defined
               while employed by Shaw, the Board of Directors
               of Shaw may by resolution terminate the active
               services of Employee.  In such event Shaw
               shall pay the full Benefit Amount to the
               Employee over the Benefit Period, as such terms
               are herein defined, in equal monthly payments
               as described in Paragraph 2(a) above or as may
               be mutually agreed upon as provided in
               Paragraph 2(d) below.  If the Employee should
               die after the onset of total disability but
               prior to retirement, the Employee shall be
               deemed to have retired at death and payments of
               the Benefit Amount originally determined at the
               onset of total disability shall be continued
               for the remainder of the Benefit Period
               established at the time of total disability to
               the Designated Beneficiary.

          (c)  Death.    If the Employee should die while
               employed by Shaw prior to his normal retirement
               date, Shaw shall pay to such person or persons
               designated in writing by the Employee Benefit
               Amount during the Benefit Period in equal
               monthly payments as described in Paragraph 2(a)
               above as those terms are herein defined.

          (d)  Lump Sum or Modified Payments.  At any time<PAGE>
               after the retirement, death or disability of
               the Employee, Shaw and the Employee or, in the
               event of the Employee's death, the Designated
               Beneficiary may agree upon a more accelerated
               method of payment, or a lump sum payment of all
               the unpaid balance of the Benefit Amount,
               discounted to present value by any method
               mutually satisfactory to the parties.

    3.    Other Benefits.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
          construed to alter, impair or affect the rights of the
          Employee to participate in any pension, profit-sharing or
          other benefit plan now or hereafter adopted by Shaw.

    4.    Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
          inure to the benefit of the Employee and his personal
          representative, heirs, and executors and to Shaw and its
          successors and assigns.

    5.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the sole and
          entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject
          matter hereof and may be altered or amended only in writing
          and signed by the party against whom enforcement of this
          agreement may be sought.

    6.    Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced
          in accordance with Georgia Law.

    7.    Relationship Between the Parties.  This Agreement shall not be
          construed as an employment agreement between the Employee and
          Shaw nor shall any provision hereof restrict Shaw's
          right to modify or terminate the services of the Employee.


    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Shaw and the Employee have each duly executed
this Agreement the day and year written above.

Shaw Industries, Inc.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations


Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's business, as well as the United States' carpet
industry in general, is cyclical in nature and
is significantly affected by general economic conditions.  The
level of carpet sales tends to reflect fluctuations in
consumer spending for durable goods and, to a lesser extent,
fluctuations in interest rates and new housing starts.
Sales and customer order unit levels during fiscal 1994 were
higher than in fiscal 1993 as the Company, the carpet
industry and the general economy continued to rebound.
Specifically, the Company had a 13.3 percent increase in fiscal
1994 net sales over fiscal 1993 principally related to a volume
increase in shipments. Recent international acquisitions were
a contributing factor to this increase in volume.  The industry business
activity for 1994 was reflective of the general economy and moved ahead at
a reasonable growth rate.

     During fiscal 1994, working capital decreased $29.2 million
and cash decreased $34.9 million.  The principal
source of cash was provided by operating activities in the amount
of $146.2 million, principally from net income
of $129.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $86.5
million.  Financing activities also provided cash in the
amount of $43.6 million, which principally resulted from
additional borrowings of $170.0 million from the revolving
credit agreement and an increase in net borrowings of short-term
notes payable of $115.0 million, offset by net long-
term debt payments of $138.2 million, purchases of treasury stock
of $69.7 million, capital lease payments of $6.5
million and the payment of cash dividends of $28.7 million.  The
principal cash flow items used in investing
activities were for additions to property, plant and equipment of
$164.2 million and investments in business assets
acquired of $63.6 million.



                               5<PAGE>


     The Company's liquidity condition remains strong.
Conservation of capital and the maintenance of a strong
balance sheet have enabled the Company to become a preeminent
force in the carpet industry.  During 1994, the
Company elected to prepay notes payable with interest rates of
9.48% to 10.49%.  An extraordinary charge of
$3,363,000 (net of income tax benefit of $2,150,000) was incurred
as a result of this early retirement.  The Company
replaced this debt with borrowings under the revolving credit
agreement at LIBOR-based rates providing for substantial
future interest savings.  Capital expenditures (including capital
lease obligations, but not including acquisitions in
1994) for incremental additions and modifications to plant and
equipment necessary to maintain the facilities in a
modern, state-of-the-art condition were $164.6 million for  fiscal
1994.  Management anticipates capital expenditures
and capitalized lease obligations of approximately $130.0 million
during fiscal 1995 to maintain its facilities and to
expand and upgrade its tufting, dyeing, finishing, yarn
processing, distribution, transportation and materials handling
equipment to meet anticipated increases in sales volume and to
improve efficiency.  These expenditures will be
funded through cash flow from operations and, if appropriate,
through additional sources of long-term capital.  The
Company has short-term credit lines with banks aggregating $300.0
million, of which $165.0 million was unused at
July 2, 1994.  The Company believes it could expand its line of
credit and long-term bank facilities, if necessary.

Inflation

     The Company's manufacturing costs and operating expenses are
affected by price changes.  The costs of
fiber and other raw materials decreased in fiscal 1992, 1993 and
1994 from the levels experienced in fiscal 1991.
The Company has historically mitigated inflationary effects by
passing price changes along to its customers and by
continually developing and implementing more cost-effective
manufacturing and other operational procedures.  The
Company's ability to mitigate the effects of price changes will
depend on market factors.



Results of Operations - Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993

     Net sales increased $309,224,000, or 13.3 percent, to
$2,630,034,000 in fiscal 1994, primarily as a result
of an increase in the volume of shipments.  Results for fiscal
1994 included incremental sales of $139,378,000
attributable to recent international acquisitions.  The results
of the acquired operations did not have a material effect
on the Company's net income in 1994.  Gross profit margins as a
percentage of net sales increased 1.1 percent to
21.3 percent for fiscal 1994 from 20.2 percent for fiscal 1993
principally as a result of an increase in the efficiency
relationship of volume and fixed costs.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased $45,762,000 or 16.3
percent in fiscal 1994 compared to fiscal 1993, and increased .3
percent to 12.4 percent of net sales.  The increase
in percentage of net sales is due substantially to aggressive
sales efforts to increase sales.  Interest expense, net,
decreased $1,366,000 to  $25,154,000 and decreased .2 percent to
1.0 percent of net sales.  The effective income tax
rate decreased .9 percent to 37.4 percent for fiscal 1994
compared to fiscal 1993 primarily due to deferred tax
adjustments.


Results of Operations - Fiscal 1993 Compared to Fiscal 1992

     Net sales increased $569,525,000, or 32.5 percent, to
$2,320,810,000 in fiscal 1993, primarily as a result
of an increase in the volume of shipments.  Results for fiscal
1993 included incremental sales of $415,413,000
attributable to acquisitions.  Gross profit margins as a
percentage of net sales increased 1.6 percent to 20.2 percent
for fiscal 1993 compared to 18.6 percent for fiscal 1992
principally as a result of an increase in the efficiency
relationship of volume and fixed costs.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased $73,981,000 or 35.8
percent in fiscal 1993 compared to fiscal 1992, and increased .3
percent to 12.1 percent of net sales.  The increase
in percentage of net sales is due substantially to continued
sales efforts to increase sales in a weak economy.  Interest
expense, net, increased $1,118,000 to $26,520,000 in fiscal 1993
compared to fiscal 1992 due principally to
additional borrowings.  The effective income tax rate was 38.3
percent in fiscal 1993 compared to 38.4 percent in
fiscal 1992.

July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992

Note 1  Summary of Accounting Policies
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Shaw Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated
in consolidation. The Company's fiscal year end, which is
the Saturday closest to June 30, has been changed to
the Saturday closest to December 31 effective in December 1994.
     Revenues are recognized when goods are shipped.
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost
includes materials, direct and indirect labor and
factory overhead.  Market with respect to raw materials is
replacement cost and for work-in-process and finished
goods is net realizable value.  The Company primarily uses the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing its
inventories in order to more properly match current costs against
current revenues, thereby reducing the effects of
inflation on earnings.  If LIFO inventories were valued at
current costs, the inventory amounts would have been
$6,449,000 and $5,984,000 lower than those reported at July 2,
1994 and July 3, 1993, respectively.  During 1993,
inventory quantities were reduced.  This reduction resulted in a
liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at
higher costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost
of 1993 purchases, the effect of which increased cost
of goods sold by approximately  $1,033,000 and decreased net
income by approximately  $635,000, but did not affect
earnings per share.
     Property, Plant and Equipment is recorded at cost.  Renewals
and betterments are capitalized; maintenance
and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred.  Maintenance and
repairs expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$78,492,000, $68,977,000 and $50,527,000, respectively.  The cost
and accumulated depreciation of property retired
or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any
gains or losses thereon are included in income.
For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets (15 to 35 years for buildings and 5 to 14
years for machinery and equipment).  Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the terms of the leases.
     Costs in excess of the fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired are recorded as goodwill and are
amortized using the straight-line method over a period not to
exceed 40 years.  The recoverability of goodwill is
periodically reviewed by management based on current and
anticipated conditions.  Accumulated amortization was
$2,590,000 and $666,000 at July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993,
respectively.
     Accrued Liabilities include $19,640,000 and $15,692,000 for
workers' compensation claims and $22,278,000
and $20,237,000 for returns and allowances at July 2, 1994 and
July 3, 1993, respectively.
     Deferred Income Taxes are provided for temporary differences
in recording various items for financial and
income tax reporting purposes.
     The Company's Retirement Savings Plan provides, among other
things, for voluntary contributions by
employees not to exceed 15% of their gross salaries and wages and
a 50% matching contribution by the Company
for employees with three or more years of continuous employment.
During 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company
contributed $8,612,000, $8,133,000 and $5,820,000,  respectively,
under the plan.
     The Company has a Deferred Compensation Plan for key
personnel.  The plan provides, among other things,
for certain deferred compensation to become payable on the
employee's death, retirement or total disability as set
forth in the plan.  During 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company
provided $2,243,000, $1,925,000, and $1,639,000,
respectively, under the plan.  These amounts have been recorded
as Other Liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheets.
     Earnings Per Share have been computed based upon the
weighted average shares outstanding and include
the number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding
during the year. All Earnings Per Share and
Shareholders' Investment amounts have been adjusted for the
two-for-one stock splits effected in the form of  stock
dividends in December 1993 and March 1992.
     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 1994 presentation.

      The Company elected to exercise its option to prepay the
9.48%, 9.31% and 10.49% term notes payable at June
30, 1994.  An extraordinary charge of $3,363,000 (net of income
tax benefit of $2,150,000) was incurred as a result
of the early retirement of the notes payable.
   The revolving credit agreement was amended during 1994 to
provide for borrowings of up to $300 million.
This increase in availability was utilized to repay the term notes
payable.  The revolving credit agreement expires in
fiscal year 2000.  The LIBOR rate at July 2, 1994 was approximately 4.8%.
     The amended revolving credit agreement contains, among other
provisions (1) restrictions as to creation or
assumption of liens, payments of cash dividends and acquisitions
of the Company's stock, (2) limitation as to new
indebtedness and lease obligations, and (3) financial
requirements as to minimum working capital ($200,000,000),
current ratio of 1.75 and ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of
1.5 in 1994 (actual was 1.6) and 2.0 thereafter.  Retained
earnings of $82,289,000 are available for the payment of cash
dividends and the acquisition of the Company's stock
at July 2, 1994.
       The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt,
including the capitalized lease obligations, as of July 2, 1994
are as follows:  1995 - $40,579,000; 1996 - $73,962,000; 1997 -
$4,416,000; 1998 - $76,555,000; 1999 -
$75,235,000; 2000 and thereafter - $152,024,000.  The carrying
value of the Company's variable rate debt
approximates fair market value.

Note 3 Shareholders' Investment
     Under the Company's 1987 Incentive Stock Option Plan, eight
million shares of common stock are reserved
for issuance at a price no less than the market value on the date
granted.  These options are exercisable over five
years.
     Under the Company's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan, six
million shares of common stock are reserved
for issuance at a price no less than the market value on the date
granted.  These options are exercisable over five
to ten years.
     The Company's 1989 Discounted Stock Option Plan provides for
the issuance of up to 880,000 shares of
common stock to key employees.  Options for 880,000 shares were
granted to three officers at $.25 per share.  The
difference between the option price and market price at the date
of grant is being amortized over the option period.
For 1994, 1993 and 1992 this expense was $798,000 for each year.
Beginning in July 1990, 176,000 shares per year
are exercisable for five years.  During 1994, 176,000 shares were
exercised, 352,000 shares were exercised in 1993,
no shares were exercised in 1992 and 176,000 shares were
exercised in 1991.
     During March 1989, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights
Plan and pursuant thereto declared a
dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock.
When exercisable, each Right will entitle its
holder to buy a fraction of a share of Series A
Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $12.50 per share
(the "Purchase Price").  If a person or group acquires or makes a
tender or exchange offer to acquire 20% or more
of the Company's common stock without the consent of the Company
(an "Acquiring Shareholder"), the Rights will
become exercisable and each Right will entitle the holder, other
than the Acquiring Shareholder , to receive, upon
payment of the Purchase Price, in lieu of preferred stock, a
number of shares of common stock of the Company
having a market value equal to twice the Purchase Price.  The
Rights may be redeemed by the Company under
certain circumstances at a price of $.01 per Right.  The Rights
have no voting power and, until exercised, no dilutive
effect on net income per common share.  If not previously
redeemed, the Rights will expire in April 1999.  The
Company has designated 200,000 shares, of the 250,000 shares of
preferred stock authorized, as Series A
Participating Preferred Stock for issuance upon exercise of the
Rights.
     In December 1992, 4,471,500 shares of the Company's common
stock were issued in a public offering.
Net proceeds from the sale of the common stock of $125,215,000
were used to reduce short-term notes payable of
$120,000,000 incurred to finance the acquisition of the
polypropylene carpet fiber manufacturing operations of
Amoco Fabrics and Fibers Company in September 1992, and the
balance of the proceeds of $5,215,000 was used
for working capital.

      Note 4 Income Taxes

           On July 4, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
Under  SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the difference between the financial accounting and tax accounting basis of
assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets or liabilities at the end of each
period are determined using the currently enacted tax rate expected to apply
to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability
is expected to be realized.  There was no cumulative effect resulting from the
adoption.

     The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (000's omitted):

Note 5 Commitments and Contingencies
     From time to time the Company is subject to claims and suits
arising in the course of its business.  In April
1993, the Company became a defendant in certain litigation
alleging personal injury resulting from personal exposure
to volatile organic compounds found in carpet produced by the
Company.  The complaints seek injunctive relief and
unspecified money damages on all claims.  The Company has denied
any liability.  In May 1993, the Company
became a defendant in certain litigation alleging violation of
both federal and state laws relating to unfair
competition.  The complaint seeks an injunction regarding the
unfair competition claims and money damages.  The
Company has denied any liability.  The Company believes that it
has meritorious defenses in these suits and that the
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.  The
Company will vigorously defend these suits.  In June 1994, the
Company and several other carpet manufacturers
received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice relating to
an investigation of the industry.  The Company believes that once
this investigation is completed it will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or
results of operations.
     The Company has entered into several capitalized leases for
machinery and equipment, including computer
equipment, at a cost of $49,415,000 at July 2, 1994 and
$37,644,000 at July 3, 1993.  These assets are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and amortization is
included in depreciation expense.  Accumulated
amortization of capital lease cost was $30,926,000 and
$25,219,000 at July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, respectively.
The related obligations are included in long-term debt (Note 2).
The Company also leases warehouses and showroom
space, customer service centers and certain equipment under
operating leases.
     At July 2, 1994, future minimum lease payments for all
capital and operating leases exceeding one year
were:<PAGE>

Note 6 Acquisitions
     On May 29, 1992, the Company acquired Salem Carpet Mills, Inc.
("Salem") in accordance with the terms of a merger agreement
announced on February 9, 1992.  Pursuant to the terms of the
merger, former Salem shareholders not electing to receive cash
received .363 (unadjusted) of a share of the Company's common stock for each
share of Salem common stock owned immediately prior to the merger.
The aggregate value of the Company's common stock exchanged for the
Salem common stock was $69,685,000.  The holders of approximately
3% of Salem's common shares elected to receive cash of $7.98 per
common share in the merger totalling approximately $2,100,000.
     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase
transaction, and accordingly, the results of operations of Salem
have been included in the accompanying financial statements since
May 30, 1992.  The purchase price was allocated to assets and
liabilities based on their estimated fair value as of the date of
the acquisition.  The excess of the consideration paid over the
estimated fair value of net assets acquired was
$38,843,000 and has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on
the straight-line basis over 40 years.  The fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed was $158,833,000 and $125,860,000,
respectively.  The following table summarizes on a pro forma basis
the consolidated results of operations as though Salem had been
acquired on June 30, 1991 (000's except per share data):

Pty., Ltd., Braybrook, Victoria, Australia (together, "CCI"),
enabling the Company to participate in a government-supported
rationalization of the Australian carpet industry.  On November 4,
1993, the Company acquired the remaining interest in the joint
venture.  Until November 4, 1993, the investment was accounted for
using the equity method, and accordingly, the Company included its
share of CCI's income in other income.  Subsequent to November 4,
1993, the results of operations of CCI are included in the
accompanying financial statements.
