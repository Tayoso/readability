                            PART I

Item 1.                           BUSINESS

     (a) General Development of Business.

      The  Perkin-Elmer Corporation was incorporated  in  1939
under  the laws of the State of New York.  Together  with  its
consolidated   subsidiaries,  The   Perkin-Elmer   Corporation
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "Registrant"  or  the
"Corporation") develops, manufactures, and sells  products  in
the industry segment described in sub-item (c) below.

      On February 18, 1993, the shareholders of Registrant and
Applied  Biosystems,  Inc. ("ABI"), a  supplier  of  automated
systems  for  life science research and related  applications,
approved  the  merger of a subsidiary of Registrant  with  and
into  ABI  which  resulted  in  ABI  becoming  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  Registrant.  Effective July 1, 1994,  ABI  was
merged  into  Registrant  and is now  the  Applied  Biosystems
division of Registrant.

      On  July 29, 1993, Registrant announced plans to  divest
its  Material  Sciences segment which consists  of  its  Metco
Division  ("Metco") headquartered in Westbury, New  York.   On
April  18,  1994,  Registrant entered into an  agreement  with
Sulzer Inc. to sell Metco.  Registrant expects to complete the
sale in calendar year 1994.

      The  consolidated  financial  statements  and  schedules
reflect  the  merger with ABI as a pooling  of  interests  and
present  the  Corporation's Material  Sciences  segment  as  a
discontinued operation.

     On May 18, 1993, Registrant amended its By-laws to change
Registrant's fiscal year end from July 31 to June  30.   Prior
to   fiscal  1993,  the  financial  statements  of   ABI   and
Registrant's subsidiaries outside the United States  were  for
fiscal  years  ended  June  30,  while  Registrant's  domestic
operations reported on a July 31 fiscal year end.

     In fiscal year 1990 Registrant divested the net assets of
what   had   been   its   Semiconductor   Equipment,   Avionic
Instrumentation, and Electro-Optical segments.


     (b) Financial Information About Industry Segments.

     Registrant  is engaged in one business segment  which  is
generally  described as analytical instruments.   Accordingly,
separate segment financial information is not provided.

                                     - 1 -
<PAGE>

(c) Narrative Description of Business.


BUSINESS

      Registrant develops, manufactures, markets,  sells,  and
services  analytical  instrument systems.   Included  in  this
industry   segment   are  biochemical  analytical   instrument
systems,  consisting of instruments and associated  consumable
products,  for life science research and related applications.
These automated systems are used for synthesis, amplification,
purification,  isolation, analysis and sequencing  of  nucleic
acids,   proteins,  and  other  biological  molecules.    This
industry  segment also includes analytical instrument  systems
for  determining  the composition and molecular  structure  of
chemical substances (both organic and inorganic) and measuring
the concentration of materials in a sample.  These instruments
include:   spectrophotometers utilizing a number of analytical
techniques; gas and liquid chromatographs; thermal  analyzers;
thermal   cyclers;  analytical  balances;  flame  photometers;
polarimeters;  data-handling  devices  that  are   principally
designed for use with analytical instruments; and data systems
for applications in analytical chemistry.  In a joint venture,
Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Registrant is engaged  in  the
manufacture and sale of mass spectrometry instrument  systems.
Registrant also develops, manufactures, markets, and  services
on-line,  real  time,  process  analysis  systems  to  monitor
process quality and environmental purity.

      Registrant's  instruments are used by private  industry,
educational   and  research  institutions,  and   governmental
entities   for   fundamental  research,   applied   industrial
research, quality control, medical research, hospital clinical
testing,   pollution   analysis,  drug   identification,   and
forensics.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

      In  the  United States, Registrant markets  the  largest
portion  of  its products directly through its own  sales  and
distribution   organization,   although   certain   analytical
instruments are marketed through independent distributors  and
sales representatives.  Sales to major markets outside of  the
United   States   are   generally  made   by   foreign   sales
subsidiaries, although some sales are made directly  from  the
United  States  to  foreign customers.  In  foreign  countries
where sales potential does not warrant the establishment of  a
sales    subsidiary,   sales   are   made   through    various
representative  and distributorship arrangements.   Registrant
owns or leases sales and service offices in strategic regional
locations  in  the  United States, and  in  foreign  countries
through   its  foreign  sales  subsidiaries  and  distribution
operations.   None  of  Registrant's products  is  distributed
through retail outlets.

RAW MATERIALS

       There  are  no  specialized  raw  materials  that   are
particularly   essential  to  the  operation  of  Registrant's
business.   Registrant's manufacturing  operations  require  a
wide  variety  of  raw  materials, electronic  and  mechanical
components,  chemical  and biochemical  materials,  and  other
supplies, some of which are occasionally found to be in  short
supply.   Registrant has multiple commercial sources for  most
components and supplies but is dependent on single sources for
a  limited  number  of  such items, in which  case  Registrant
normally secures long term supply contracts.

PATENTS, LICENSES, AND FRANCHISES

      Registrant has pursued a policy of seeking patent protection
in the  United States  and  other  countries  for developments,
improvements, and inventions originating within its organization


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

which  are  incorporated  in  Registrant's
products or which fall within its fields of interest.  Certain
licenses  under  patents have been granted  to,  and  received
from,  other  entities.  Registrant is licensed by Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. under patents relating to polymerase chain reaction
technology  ("PCR"), which patents expire July 28,  2004.   In
Registrant's  opinion,  however, no  other  single  patent  or
license, or group of patents or licenses, or any franchise, is
material to its business as a whole.

      From  time to time, Registrant has asserted that various
competitors and others are infringing Registrant's patents and
similarly,  from  time  to  time, others  have  asserted  that
Registrant  was infringing patents owned by them.   Generally,
such  claims are settled by mutual agreement on a satisfactory
basis  and  have  resulted  in the  granting  of  licenses  by
Registrant or the granting of licenses to Registrant.

SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS

      Registrant's  business  is  not  subject  to  pronounced
seasonal fluctuations.

BACKLOG

      Registrant's  recorded  backlog was  approximately  $155
million at June 30, 1994 and 1993.  With respect to commercial
products,  it  is Registrant's general policy  to  include  in
backlog only purchase orders or production releases which have
firm delivery dates within one year.  Recorded backlog may not
result in sales because of cancellation or other factors.   It
is anticipated that all orders included in the current backlog
will be delivered before the close of fiscal year 1995.

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SALES

      No  material portion of Registrant's business is subject
to  renegotiation of profits or termination  of  contracts  or
subcontracts at the election of the United States Government.

COMPETITION

      The  industry  segment in which Registrant  operates  is
highly competitive and is characterized by the application  of
advanced  technology.   There  are  numerous  companies  which
specialize in, and a number of larger companies which devote a
significant  portion of their resources to,  the  development,
manufacture,  and  sale of products which compete  with  those
manufactured  or  sold  by Registrant.  Many  of  Registrant's
competitors are well-known manufacturers with a high degree of
technical   proficiency.    In   addition,   competition    is
intensified by the ever-changing nature of the technologies in
the  industry in which Registrant is engaged.  The markets for
Registrant's   products  are  characterized   by   specialized
manufacturers that often have strength in narrow  segments  of
these markets.  While the absence of reliable statistics makes
it   difficult  to  determine  Registrant's  relative   market
position,  Registrant is confident it is one of the  principal
manufacturers  in  its  field,  marketing  a  broad  line   of
analytical instruments and life science systems.  In  addition
to  competing  in  terms  of  the technology  that  Registrant
offers,  Registrant competes in terms of price,  service,  and
quality.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND ENGINEERING

      Registrant  is  actively engaged in  basic  and  applied
research,  development, and engineering programs  designed  to
develop new products and to improve existing products.  During
fiscal   years   1994,  1993,  and  1992,   Registrant   spent
approximately  $94  million, $84  million,  and  $81  million,
respectively, on company sponsored research, development,  and
engineering activities.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      Registrant is subject to federal, state, and local  laws
and regulations regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment,  or otherwise relating to the protection  of  the
environment, in those jurisdictions where Registrant  operates
or  maintains  facilities.  Registrant does not  believe  that
compliance  with  all  environmental provisions  will  have  a
material  effect  on  its business, and  no  material  capital
expenditures are expected for environmental control.

EMPLOYEES

      As  of  June 30, 1994, Registrant employed 5,954 persons
worldwide.   None of Registrant's United States  employees  is
subject to collective bargaining agreements.

      (d)  Financial  Information About Foreign  and  Domestic
Operations and Export Sales.

      A  summary  of  net revenues to unaffiliated  customers,
operating income, and identifiable assets attributable to each
of  Registrant's  geographic areas and export  sales  for  the
fiscal  years  1994, 1993, and 1992 is incorporated herein  by
reference  to  Note 6 on Pages 38-40 of the Annual  Report  to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

      Registrant's  consolidated net revenues to  unaffiliated
customers  in countries other than the United States  for  the
fiscal  years  1994,  1993, and 1992 were  approximately  $607
million, $607 million, and $558 million, or approximately 59%,
60%,  and 58%, respectively, of Registrant's consolidated  net
revenues.

      All of the Registrant's manufacturing facilities outside
of  the continental United States are located in Germany,  the
United  Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  Japan,  and
the  Peoples  Republic  of  China.   There  are  currently  no
material  foreign  exchange controls  or  similar  limitations
restricting the repatriation to the United States  of  capital
or earnings from operations outside the United States.

     (e)  Discontinued Operations


     On  July  29,  1993, Registrant announced  its  plans  to
divest  Metco  headquartered in  Westbury,  New  York.   Metco
produces  combustion,  electric arc and plasma  thermal  spray
equipment  and  supplies.   Registrant  has  entered  into  an
agreement  with  Sulzer  Inc., a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
Sulzer  Ltd., Winterthur, Switzerland for the sale  of  Metco.
The  completion of the sale is subject to closing  conditions,
including  obtaining relevant government regulatory approvals.
The transaction has taken longer to complete than expected due
primarily to obtaining necessary government approvals in  both
the  U.S.  and  Europe.   As a result  of  this  and  negative
operating  factors, Registrant recorded an after-tax  loss  on
disposal  of $7.7 million during the fourth quarter of  fiscal
year 1994.

     On  October 5, 1992, prior to its merger with Registrant,
ABI  announced the decision to distribute to its  shareholders
approximately  82%  of  the  stock  of  its  subsidiary,  Lynx
Therapeutics,   Inc.   ("Lynx"),  the   successor   to   ABI's
therapeutics division.  The financial statements  reflect  the
Lynx  operating results as a discontinued operation.  The  net
assets of Lynx were not significant.

Item 3.                    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Corporation has been named as a defendant in several
legal  actions arising from the conduct of its normal business
activities.  Although the amount of any liability  that  might
arise  with  respect  to  any  of  these  matters  cannot   be
accurately  predicted, the resulting liability, if  any,  will
not in the opinion of management of Registrant have a material
adverse effect on the financial statements of Registrant.   In
addition,  although no legal claim was filed, the  Corporation
participated  in the United States government's  investigation
of  the Hubble Space Telescope.  Registrant settled all of the
government's  potential claims with regard to this  matter  on
October 4, 1993, for $15 million.

     Registrant  is  one  of  approximately  125  third  party
defendants named in United States of America v. Davis  et  al.
which  is pending in the United States District Court for  the
District  of  Rhode Island.  The third party  plaintiffs,  who
were  named as defendants and potentially responsible  parties
in   the   Government's  initial  complaint,  seek   equitable
contribution and indemnification in the event they  are  found
liable  for  remediation  costs relating  to  the  removal  of
hazardous substances from a site located in Smithfield,  Rhode
Island  (initially  estimated by the Government  to  be  $27.8
million  but most recently estimated to be $77.5 million).   A
trial on the question of the third party plaintiffs' liability
to  the  Government  has been held, but no decision  has  been
rendered.   Until the liability of the third party  plaintiffs
has  been established, the court will not consider the  amount
of  any  such  liability or the validity of  any  third  party
claims.  While the Registrant contends that it should have  no
liability  in  this  case, because of the uncertainty  of  all
litigation,  it cannot definitively state that it  will  incur
less than $100,000 in monetary sanctions.

Item 4.             SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF
                       SECURITY HOLDERS

      No  matter was submitted to a vote of security  holders,

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON
                   FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

To the Board of Directors
of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation

      Our  audits of the consolidated financial statements referred
to  in our report dated July 28, 1994, appearing on Page 45 of  the
1994  Annual Report to Shareholders of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation
(which   report   and   consolidated   financial   statements   are
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K)  also
included  an audit of the Financial Statement Schedules  listed  in
Item  14(a)2  of  this Form 10-K.  We did not audit  the  Financial
Statement  Schedules of Applied Biosystems, Inc.,  a  wholly  owned
subsidiary,  as  of and for the year ended July  31,  1992.   Those
schedules were audited by other auditors, whose report thereon  has
been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar  as
it relates to the amounts included for Applied Biosystems, Inc., is
based  solely  on  the report of other auditors.   Based  upon  our
audits  and the report of other auditors, these Financial Statement
Schedules present fairly, in all material respects, the information
set  forth  therein  when  read  in conjunction  with  the  related
consolidated financial statements.

         (a)       Commercial  Paper  refers  to   unsecured   debt
obligations maturing in fixed periods that range       from  30  to
180  days;  interest at fixed rates is payable on  maturity.   Bank
Borrowings are           unsecured debt obligations including those
due on demand, as well as those with fixed terms.      With respect
to  some Bank Borrowings, interest rates are fixed; in other cases,
interest floats in  accordance with a prescribed index.

       (b)     The average amount outstanding during the period was
determined on the basis of average      month-end balances of  Bank
Borrowings   and  average  daily  balances  for  Commercial   Paper
borrowings.

        (c)      For  Bank  Borrowings and  Commercial  Paper,  the
weighted average interest rate during the    period was computed by
dividing the interest expense for the year by the average amount of
short-term borrowings outstanding during the period.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Shareholders and Board of Directors
     of Applied Biosystems, Inc.:


We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Applied
Biosystems, Inc. as of June 30, 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (not presented
separately herein).  Our audit also included the financial
statement schedules (not presented separately herein).  
These financial statements and financial statement schedules 
are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Applied Biosystems, Inc. at June 30, 1992, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
fiscal year then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 13, the consolidated statement of
operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 has been
reclassified to present the Company's subsidiary, Lynx
Therapeutics, Inc., as a discontinued operation.

     date of payment at the rate of 6% per annum, calculated
     on the basis of a 365-day year.  If the Estimated Pur-
     chase Price exceeds the Purchase Price, then the Seller

     cess, together with simple interest thereon from the
     Closing Date to the date of payment at the rate of 6%
     per annum, calculated on the basis of a 365-day year.
               (d)  Any amount payable pursuant to Section
     2.4(c) hereof shall be paid by wire transfer of immedi-
     ately available funds to a bank account designated by the
     Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, as soon as
     practicable following the determination of the Final
     Statement, but in no event more than three (3) days
     thereafter.

                            ARTICLE III
                   Representations and Warranties
               3.1  Representations and Warranties of the
     Seller.  The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the
     Purchaser as follows:
               (a)  Organization of the Seller and Material
     Subsidiaries.  The Seller and each of the Material Sub-
     sidiaries are corporations duly organized, validly exist-
     ing and in good standing under the laws of their respec-
     tive jurisdictions of incorporation or organization and
     each such entity has all necessary corporate power to
     own, lease and operate its respective Purchased Assets
     and to carry on the Business conducted by it as now being
     conducted.  The Seller and each of the Material Subsid-
     iaries are duly qualified and in good standing to do
     business in all jurisdictions in which the Purchased
     Assets owned or used by it or the Business conducted by
     it makes such qualification necessary, except for those
     jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified
     will not have a material adverse effect on the Purchased
     Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the business, finan-
     cial condition or results of operations of the Business,
     taken as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect").
               (b)  Authorization and Noncontravention.  The
     execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has
     been duly authorized by the Seller and no other corporate
     proceedings on the part of the Seller are necessary to
     authorize this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
     hereby.  The Seller has full corporate power and authori-
     ty to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obli-
     gations hereunder.  This Agreement has been duly and
     validly executed and delivered by the Seller and consti-
     tutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the
     Seller enforceable against the Seller in accordance with
     its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
     transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
     general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
     rights and to general equity principles.  The execution
     and the delivery by the Seller of this Agreement and the
     consummation by the Seller of the Purchase will not (i)
     violate any term or provision of the Restated Certificate
     of Incorporation or By-laws of the Seller; (ii) subject
     to obtaining any required authorizations, approvals,
     consents or waivers set forth in Schedule 3.1(j) hereto,
     conflict with or result in a breach of or constitute a
     default under or result in the termination of, or entitle
     any party to accelerate (whether after the filing or
     notice or lapse of time or both), any agreement to which
     the Seller or any Material Subsidiary is a party or by
     which it is bound or to which any of its assets are
     subject, or result in the creation of any lien or encum-
     brance upon any of said assets, other than conflicts,
     breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations, liens or
     encumbrances which, individually or in the aggregate,
     would not have a Material Adverse Effect or materially
     impair the ability of the parties hereto to consummate
     the Purchase; or (iii) subject to obtaining the authori-
     zations, approvals, consents or waivers set forth in
     Schedule 3.1(j) hereto and to the expiration of the
     applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
     Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
     Act"), the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
     (the "Exon-Florio Amendment") and the Federal Republic of
     Germany's Act Against Restraints of Competition (the "GWB
     Act"), violate or result in a breach of or constitute a
     default under any judgment, order, decree, law, rule,
     regulation or other restriction of any court, government
     or governmental agency to which the Seller, any Subsid-
     iary or any of the Purchased Assets are subject, other
     than violations, breaches or defaults which individually
     or in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse
     Effect or materially impair the ability of the parties
     hereto to consummate the Purchase.
               (c)  The Purchased Assets.  Except as set forth
     Schedule 3.1(c) hereto, the Purchased Assets constitute
     in all material respects the rights, properties and
     assets (real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible)
     used in the conduct of the Business as currently con-
     ducted by the Seller and the Subsidiaries.  The Seller
     has good and valid title to the owned Purchased Assets
     (other than the Owned Real Property, which is the subject
     of Section 3.1(d) hereof, and the Intellectual Property,
     which is the subject of Section 3.1(k) hereof), free and
     clear of all Liens except for Liens set forth on Schedule
     3.1(c) hereto, which shall be released on or prior to the
     Closing.
               (d)  Real Property.   Seller and each Subsid-
     iary has fee simple and insurable title, or the equiva-
     lent of fee simple and insurable title under applicable
     law in the case of the Owned Real Property located out-
     side the United States, to the Owned Real Property iden-
     tified as belonging to it on Schedule 1.2(E), free and
     clear of all liens, covenants, conditions, restrictions,
     rights of way, easements, encroachments, charges and
     encumbrances or other adverse claims or interests of any
     nature other than:  (i) liens for current taxes not yet
     due and payable; (ii) liens for installments for special
     or other assessments not yet due and payable; (iii) the
     matters set forth on Schedule 3.1(d) hereto; (iv) laws,
     ordinances and governmental regulations (including, but
     not limited to, building and zoning ordinances) restrict-
     ing and regulating but not prohibiting the occupancy, use
     or enjoyment of the Owned Real Property for the business
     presently conducted thereon, or regulating the character,
     dimensions or location of any improvement now or hereaf-
     ter erected on the Owned Real Property provided the same
     are not materially violated by any existing improvements
     or the use thereof and provided the same do not prohibit
     a transfer of the Owned Real Property, (v) such other
     encroachments, easements, overlaps, gaps, boundary line
     disputes or claims and any other matters which would be
     disclosed by an accurate survey or inspection which,
     individually or in the aggregate, do not materially
     interfere with the use or operation of the particular
     Owned Real Property affected as presently used and oper-
     ated, and (vi) such other imperfections of title, encum-
     brances, covenants, conditions and restrictions which
     individually or in the aggregate, do not materially
     interfere with the use and operation of the particular
     Owned Real Property affected as presently used and oper-
     ated.  Collectively, items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v)
     and (vi) above are herein referred to as the "Permitted
     Encumbrances."  The Seller and each Subsidiary, with
     respect to each Leased Real Property identified on Sched-
     ule 3.1(l) as belonging to it, has a good and valid
     leasehold interest free and clear of all liens, charges
     and encumbrances or other adverse claims or interests of
     any nature other than: (i) claims for rent and additional
     rent not yet due and payable, and all other obligations
     of the tenant pursuant to each such lease, provided that
     tenant is not in default beyond applicable notice and
     grace provisions under such lease, (ii) matters set forth
     in Schedule 3.1(d) hereto, (iii) matters affecting its
     landlord's title, and (iv) laws, ordinances and govern-
     mental regulations (including, but not limited to, build-
     ing and zoning ordinances) restricting and regulating but
     not prohibiting the occupancy, use or enjoyment of the
     Leased Real Property for the use permitted by each such
     lease and the business presently conducted in the premis-
     es demised under each such lease, or regulating the
     character, dimensions or location of the demised premises
     or the business presently conducted on the demised pre-
     mises provided the same are not materially violated.
     Collectively, items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above are
     herein referred to as the "Permitted Leasehold Encum-
     brances".  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(d), Seller
     (A) has not pre-paid or anticipated rent or additional
     rent under any such lease, except as required by the
     terms of any Lease, (B) knows of no requirement that any
     third party (including the landlord under each such
     lease) consent to the assignment or transfer of each such
     lease or consent to the transfer of the stock of any
     Subsidiary which is a tenant under any such lease and (C)
     knows of no guarantee of the obligations of a tenant
     under any such lease by Seller or any Subsidiary except
     as shown on Schedule 4.15.
               (e)  Condemnation.  There is no pending or, to
     knowledge of the Seller, threatened condemnation of the
     Owned Real Property or, to the knowledge of Seller,
     pending or threatened condemnation of the Leased Real
     Property or any part thereof or, to the knowledge of
     Seller, any general or special assessment relating to any
     condemnation referred to in this paragraph.
               (f)  Financial Statement.  The Seller has
     previously furnished to the Purchaser (i) the audited
     statements of net sales and direct costs and expenses and
     sources and uses of cash of the Division for the fiscal
     year ended June 30, 1993 (the "Special Purpose State-
     ments"), and (ii) the Financial Statement.  Except as set
     forth in the notes to the Special Purpose Statements, the
     Financial Statement and Schedule 3.1(f) hereto, the
     Financial Statement presents fairly the June 30 Net
     Assets at June 30, 1993, and the Special Purpose State-
     ments present fairly the related net sales and direct
     costs and expenses and sources and uses of cash for the
     fiscal year then ended, in each case in accordance with
     generally accepted accounting principles consistently
     applied on a worldwide basis in accordance with the
     Seller's corporate accounting policies and directives.

     ness, any expenditures or commitments, including capital

     (vi) any sale, assignment or transfer of any material
     tangible or intangible Purchased Assets, including any

     any of the actions described in this Section.

     ened.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(h) or 3.1(k)
     hereto, neither the Seller nor any Subsidiary is subject
     to any judgment, order or decree in any lawsuit or pro-
     ceeding Related to the Business.
               (i)  Compliance with Law.  Except as set forth
     in Schedule 3.1(i) hereto and except with respect to
     Environmental Laws (compliance with which is the subject

     (i) the Business is being conducted in compliance in all
     material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
     regulations and orders and (ii) the Seller has not re-
     ceived any written complaint or notice from any govern-
     mental authority alleging that the Seller has violated

     ant to any Material Agreement in connection with the Pur-
     chase.
               (k)  Intellectual Property.  (i)  Schedule
     1.2(F) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
     trademarks, patents and material copyrights registered or
     applied for, Related to the Business, owned by the Seller
     or any Subsidiary.  Except as set forth in Schedule
     3.1(k) hereto, either the Seller or such Subsidiary is
     the sole and exclusive beneficial owner of the Intel-
     lectual Property, free and clear of all Liens.  Except as
     set forth in Schedule 3.1(k) hereto, to the knowledge of
     the Seller (x) there are no actions or proceedings pend-
     ing or threatened which challenge the Seller's right to
     use any of its material Intellectual Property in connec-
     tion with the Business and (y) the Seller's use of Intel-
     lectual Property in connection with the Business does not
     infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of others.
               (ii)  All registered trademarks, patents and
     material copyrights are validly registered, and, except
     as set forth in Schedule 3.1(k) the Seller or a Subsid-
     iary is the current record owner of all such registra-
     tions or applications therefor.  The Seller is not a
     party to any settlement agreement, consent or waiver
     which restricts the use of such Intellectual Property in
     connection with the Business.  To the knowledge of the
     Seller, no other person is infringing upon the Seller's
     rights in the Intellectual Property, except as set forth
     in Schedule 3.1(k).
               (iii)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(k),
     the Seller does not pay any royalty to anyone relating to
     the Intellectual Property.  There is no restriction or
     limitation of Seller's rights to transfer the Intellectu-
     al Property as herein contemplated.
               (iv)  Schedule 3.1(k) contains a complete and
     accurate list of all contracts, licenses, agreements or
     understandings, written or oral, Related to the Business,
     pursuant to which (a) a third party is licensing its in-
     tellectual property to the Seller, and (b) the Seller is
     licensing any Intellectual Property to a third party (the
     "Licenses").  The Seller is in compliance with all mate-
     rial terms of the Licenses and to the knowledge of the
     Seller each of the Licenses is in full force and effect.
     All royalties due and payable under the Licenses have
     been paid.
               (l)  Material Agreements.  Listed on Schedule
     3.1(l) is (i) each agreement, contract, license and per-
     sonal property lease and sublease, written or oral,
     Related to the Business involving an obligation of the
     Seller or a Subsidiary or of the other party or parties
     thereto of more than $100,000 in any year (other than
     contracts cancelable upon up to sixty (60) days notice,
     without penalty), (ii) each lease of real property Relat-
     ed to the Business (collectively, the "Leases"), (iii)
     each agreement which by its terms is over one year in

     ed to the Business (other than contracts cancelable upon
     up to sixty (60) days notice, without penalty), (iv) each
     agreement or contract which by its terms will result in a
     loss to the Business in excess of $50,000, and (v) all
     agreements or contracts which by their terms will result
     in an aggregate loss to the Business in excess of
     $500,000 (hereinafter collectively called the "Material
     Agreements").  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(l)
     hereto, to the knowledge of the Seller, none of the
     Seller, any Subsidiary or the other party or parties to
     any Material Agreement is in default with respect to any
     material term or condition thereof and no event has oc-
     curred which through the passage of time or the giving of
     notice, or both, would constitute such a default.  Nei-
     ther the Seller nor any Subsidiary has received any
     written notice of any default by the Seller or any Sub-
     sidiary under any of the Material Agreements.  The list
     of Material Agreements on Schedule 3.1(e) hereto includes
     all amendments and modifications to such Material Agree-
     ments.  Copies of all Material Agreements and Assumed
     Contracts, including all supplements and amendments

     Purchaser prior to the Closing.
               (m)  Employee Benefit Plans.  (i)  Schedule
     3.1(m)(i) hereto lists all "employee benefit plans,"
     within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, covering
     persons employed or formerly employed in the United
     States by the Division in connection with the Business
     (the "U.S. Employees").  True and complete copies of all
     plan documents and summary plan descriptions pertaining
     to all such plans (the "ERISA Plans") have been, or as
     soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement will
     be, made available to the Purchaser.
               (ii)  All ERISA Plans are in substantial com-
     pliance with ERISA.  To the knowledge of the Seller, each
     ERISA Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
     of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
     from the Internal Revenue Service (except with respect to
     amendments to such ERISA Plans adopted after August 1,
     1986), and the Seller is not aware of any circumstances
     likely to result in revocation of any such favorable de-
     termination letter.  Except as set forth on Schedule
     3.1(m)(ii) hereto, there is no material pending or, to
     the knowledge of the Seller, threatened action, suit or
     claim with respect to the ERISA Plans (other than routine
     claims for benefits in the ordinary course).  None of the
     ERISA Plans is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of
     Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.
               (iii)  Assuming the Purchaser makes the offers
     of employment provided for in Section 4.7(a) hereof, the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement will not, in and of themselves, (a) entitle any
     current or former employee of Seller or any Transferred
     Employee (as defined in Section 4.7 hereof) to any sever-
     ance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
     (b) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or in-
     crease the amount of compensation due to any such em-
     ployees, or (c) result in any employment-related expenses
     or liabilities, in every such case the full cost of which
     will not be paid by Seller.
               (iv)  Schedule 3.1(m)(iv) sets forth a list of
     all plans, agreements or arrangements pursuant to which
     any Employee receives any employee benefits from Seller
     or any Subsidiary, including without limitation, bonus,
     deferred compensation, pension, profit-sharing, severance
     and health insurance plans, agreements or arrangements
     (the "Employee Plans").  Seller has provided the Purchas-
     er with true and complete copies of all written Employee
     Plans or true and complete summaries of all oral Employee
     Plans.
               (v)  Schedule 4.7(a)(1) sets forth the annual
     salary and job title of each of the Transferred Employ-
     ees.
               (n)  Labor Matters.  The Seller has paid in
     full to, or accrued on behalf of, all Employees all
     wages, salaries, vacation pay, commissions, bonuses and
     other direct compensation for all services performed by
     them to the date hereof and all amounts required to be
     reimbursed to such Employees.  Except as set forth on
     Schedule 3.1(n), Seller has not been notified in writing
     that any charges with respect to or relating to any
     Employee are pending before the Equal Employment Opportu-
     nity Commission or any other agency responsible for the
     prevention of unlawful employment practices.  Except as
     set forth on Schedule 3.1(n), there are no employment
     contracts or severance agreements with any Employees.
     The Seller is not a party to any collective bargaining or
     similar agreement with any labor organization, group or
     association with respect to the Employees.  To the knowl-
     edge of the Seller, the Seller has not experienced, in
     the past five (5) years, any attempt by organized labor
     or its representatives to make the Seller conform to de-
     mands of organized labor relating to the U.S. Employees,
     or to enter into a binding agreement with organized labor
     that would cover the U.S. Employees.  Seller has not been
     notified in writing that there are any unfair labor
     practices, charges or complaints against the Seller with
     respect to the Business pending before the National Labor
     Relations Board or any other U.S. governmental agency
     arising out of the Seller's activities in the United
     States with respect to the Business; there is no labor
     strike, material dispute, material slowdown or material
     labor disturbance pending or, to the knowledge of the
     Seller, threatened, nor is any grievance currently being
     asserted, against the Seller with respect to the Business
     in the United States; and the Business has not experi-
     enced a labor strike, material dispute, material slow-
     down, material labor disturbance or work stoppage during
     the past five (5) years.
               Since February 1, 1991, the Seller has not ef-
     fectuated a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (each as de-
     fined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifica-
     tion Act (the "WARN Act")) affecting any site of employ-
     ment, operating unit or facility of the Seller Related to
     the Business; nor has the Seller engaged in layoffs or
     employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
     application of any similar U.S. state or local law relat-
     ing to the Business.  None of the Employees has suffered
     an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) since
     six months prior to the date hereof.
               (o)  Insurance.  Schedule 3.1(o) contains a
     complete and accurate list of all policies or binders of
     fire, liability, worker's compensation and other forms of
     insurance, including bonds but not including any insur-
     ance related to Employees other than worker's compensa-
     tion (showing as to each policy or binder the carrier,
     coverage limits, expiration dates, deductibles or reten-
     tion levels and a general description of the type of
     coverage provided) maintained by the Seller or a Subsid-
     iary with respect to the Business, any Purchased Assets,
     any Assumed Liabilities or the Employees.  The coverage
     provided under such policies and binders is in full force
     and effect on the date hereof and shall be kept in full
     force and effect by the Seller through the Closing Date.

     ness of the Purchaser, taken as a whole, or materially
     impair the ability of the parties hereto to consummate

     event such resolution fails, Purchaser and Seller agree
     to submit any such Tax Return to the Independent Account-
     ing Firm whose determination as to the propriety of
     filing such Tax Return shall be binding, and to share
     equally any and all expenses associated with such consul-
     tation.
               (ii)  For any taxable period beginning after
     the Closing Date, Purchaser shall timely prepare and
     file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns
     of the Stock Subsidiaries, and such Tax Returns shall be
     true, correct and complete to the knowledge of Purchaser,
     and shall timely pay, or cause to be paid, when due all
     Taxes relating to such Tax Returns.
               (iii)  Any Taxes described in this Section
     4.5(a)(iii) due with respect to Seller, or any Subsidiary
     that relate to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned
     between Purchaser and Seller with respect to the portions
     of any such period before and after the Closing Date, (x)
     with respect to Seller or any Subsidiary, in the case of
     real and personal property, use and intangible Taxes (in
     the case of Seller or any Asset Subsidiary to the extent
     such Taxes are Related to the Business), on a per diem
     basis and, where applicable, in accordance with the
     provisions of Code Section 164(d), and (y) with respect
     to any Stock Subsidiary, in the case of other Taxes,
     based on a deemed closing of the books of the Stock
     Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, with all standard
     exemptions, deductions, progressivity in rates and other
     items with respect to the full Straddle Period allocated
     between the portion of the Straddle Period falling in the
     Pre-Closing Tax Period and the remainder of such Straddle
     Period on a per-diem basis; provided, however, that in no
     event shall either party's obligation with respect to its
     portion of a particular Straddle Period Tax of a Stock
     Subsidiary as calculated under this clause (y) exceed the
     liability for that particular Tax of such Stock Subsid-
     iary for such Straddle Period.  Straddle Period Tax
     Returns other than those relating to Stock Subsidiaries
     shall be prepared and timely filed by the entity respon-
     sible for filing such Tax Returns under local law, regu-
     lation or custom, and Seller or Purchaser, as the case
     may be, shall cause such entity to timely file such Tax
     Returns and timely pay and Tax due with respect to such
     Tax Returns when due or assessed.   To the extent that
     any Tax Returns of a Stock Subsidiary with respect to any
     Straddle Period are due on or prior to the Closing (tak-
     ing into account applicable extensions), Seller shall
     timely prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
     filed, all such Returns and shall timely pay, or cause to
     be paid when due, all Taxes relating to such Returns.  To
     the extent any Tax Returns of a Stock Subsidiary with re-
     spect to any Straddle Period are due after the Closing
     (taking into account applicable extensions), Purchaser
     shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
     and filed, all such Tax Returns and shall timely pay, or
     cause to be paid when due, all Taxes relating to such Tax
     Returns.  All Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be pre-
     pared in a manner consistent with past practice of Seller
     or the relevant Subsidiary and in a manner that does not
     distort the taxable income or loss or Tax liability of
     Seller, any Subsidiary, Purchaser or any affiliate of the
     foregoing, except as required by law or regulation or
     otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and Seller and such Tax
     Returns shall be true, complete and correct to the best
     knowledge of the party responsible for filing such Tax
     Return under this Section 4.5(a)(iii) (the "Filing Par-
     ty").  At least fifteen (15) business days prior to the
     due date for filing (including extensions) of any Strad-
     dle Period Tax Return due after Closing, the Filing Party
     shall provide the other party with a substantially final
     draft of such Tax Return and a notice setting forth in
     reasonable detail the calculations regarding the other
     party's share of Straddle Period Taxes shown as due on
     such Tax Return (calculated as described in this Section
     4.5(a)), and the other party shall have the right to
     review such Tax Return and such notice.  The other party
     shall notify the Filing Party of any reasonable objec-
     tions the other party may have to any items set forth in
     such Tax Return and to the Filing Party's calculations
     regarding the other party's share of Straddle Period
     Taxes, and the parties agree to consult and resolve in
     good faith any such objection to the calculation of
     Straddle Period Taxes and the filing of such Tax Returns
     and to mutually consent to the filing of such Tax Re-
     turns; provided, however, that in the event such resolu-
     tion fails, each party agrees to submit any such Tax
     Return to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose determi-
     nation as to the calculation of Straddle Period Taxes and
     the propriety of filing such Tax Return shall be binding,
     and to share equally any and all expenses associated with
     such consultation.
               (iv)  To the extent a Straddle Period Tax has
     been paid in full by Seller or any Subsidiary (or an
     affiliate of any of them) prior to the Closing (excluding
     any estimated or like Tax payments), Purchaser shall pay
     to Seller at Closing the amount of any such Taxes appor-
     tioned to Purchaser under the first sentence of paragraph
     4.5(a)(iii).  With respect to all other Straddle Period
     Taxes, Seller shall pay Purchaser (but only to the extent
     not paid by Seller or any Subsidiary or an affiliate of
     any of them) or Purchaser shall pay Seller, as the case
     may be, the amount apportioned to the relevant party
     under the first sentence of paragraph 4.5(a)(iii) the
     later of the payment date of the Straddle Period Tax or
     within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the
     notice described in Section 4.5(a)(iii) (or at such other
     time as is mutually agreed by the parties) by Seller or
     Purchaser, respectively.  Seller and Purchaser shall
     adjust the amount of Straddle Period Taxes apportioned
     under the first sentence of paragraph 4.5(a)(iii) in the
     event of a change in the amount of such Taxes due as a
     result of any audit, examination, claim for refund or
     otherwise and, subject to the provisions of this Section
     4.5, make appropriate payments reflecting such adjust-
     ments.
               (b)(i)  Seller shall be entitled to retain, or
     receive payment from the Purchaser and any Subsidiary of
     any refund or credit with respect to Taxes (including,
     without limitation, refunds and credits arising by reason
     of the carryover or carryback of any deduction, loss or
     credit to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Seller's portion
     of any Straddle Period or the filing of an amended return
     for any such periods) that are described as being the
     responsibility of the Seller in Section 4.5(a).  Purchas-
     er shall promptly forward to or reimburse Seller for any
     such refunds or credits due Seller after the receipt
     thereof by Purchaser or the Subsidiaries.
               (ii)  Purchaser and the Subsidiaries shall be
     entitled to retain, or receive payment from the Seller
     of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes that are
     described as being the responsibility of Purchaser in
     Section 4.5(a) and that are not due to Seller under
     Section 4.5(b)(i).  Seller shall promptly forward to or
     reimburse Purchaser for any such refunds or credits due
     Purchaser after the receipt thereof.
               (c)  Seller shall control the representation of
     the interests of Seller and any Stock Subsidiaries in any
     Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
     to Tax Returns described in Section 4.5(a) with respect
     to which Seller may be liable for Taxes pursuant to this
     Agreement; provided, however, that Seller will consult
     with Purchaser regarding any Tax issue of a Stock Subsid-
     iary that may affect the Tax liability of Purchaser, any
     of its affiliates or any Stock Subsidiary for any period
     ending after the Closing Date and that where a particular
     Tax issue of a Stock Subsidiary would in the reasonable
     opinion of Purchaser, have an adverse effect on the Tax
     liability of Purchaser, any of its affiliates or any
     Stock Subsidiary for any period ending after the Closing
     Date, Purchaser shall have the right, at its discretion
     after good faith consultation with Seller, to release
     Seller from its obligation to indemnify Purchaser with
     respect to such Tax issue by a written agreement mutually
     agreed to by Seller and Purchaser and, in that event, to
     participate in any such audit or proceeding and control
     the representation of the interest of the relevant Stock
     Subsidiary solely with respect to such Tax issue and to
     employ counsel of its choice at its own expense for
     purposes of such participation.  Purchaser and Seller
     mutually agree to consult and cooperate with each other
     so that the transfer of control is effected in a manner
     that will minimize any disruption to any such audit or
     proceeding and so that Seller is not prejudiced in any
     such audit or proceeding.  Notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary contained or implied in this Agreement,
     without the prior approval of Purchaser, Seller shall not
     agree to compromise any issue or claim arising in any
     audit or proceeding covered by this Section 4.5(c) to the
     extent that any such compromise would affect the Tax
     liability of Purchaser, any of its affiliates, or any
     Stock Subsidiary for any period ending after the Closing
     Date (including a Straddle Period).
               (d)  Each party shall promptly notify the other
     party in writing upon receipt by the notifying party, or
     any affiliate of the notifying party, of notice of any
     pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating
     to Seller or any Asset Subsidiary (in each case only to
     the extent Related to the Business) or any Stock Subsid-
     iary, in each case for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Strad-
     dle Periods only.
               (e)  After the Closing Date, Purchaser and
     Seller shall provide each other with such cooperation and
     information relating to Seller or any Asset Subsidiary
     (in each case only to the extent Related to the Business)
     or Stock Subsidiary as either party reasonably may re-
     quest in filing any Tax Return, determining any Tax
     liability or a right to refund of Taxes, conducting or
     defending any audit or other proceeding in respect of
     Taxes or effectuating the terms of this Agreement.  Any
     information obtained under this Section 4.5(a) shall be
     kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary
     in connection with filing any Tax Return, amended return,
     or claim for refund, determining any liability or a right
     to refund of Taxes, or in conducting or defending any
     audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes.  Purchaser
     and Seller agree that the party requesting such coopera-
     tion or information shall reimburse the other party for
     the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
     in providing such cooperation or information.  Notwith-
     standing the foregoing, neither Seller nor Purchaser, nor
     any of their affiliates, shall be required unreasonably
     to prepare any document, or determine any information not
     then in its possession, in response to a request under
     this Section 4.5(e).
               (f)  All transfer, sales, use, recording, ad
     valorem, real property transfer, real property convey-
     ance, documentary, notarial, excise, value added, stamp
     and other like Taxes, fees and expenses (the "Transfer
     Taxes") which may be due or payable in connection with
     the consummation of the Purchase, including without
     limitation, fees and expenses in connection with the
     transfer or the Intellectual Property, shall be paid and
     borne by Purchaser and Seller equally, with the exception
     of any tax imposed on the transfer of real property and
     measured solely by the excess, if any, between the amount
     of Aggregate Consideration (as hereinafter defined)
     allocated to such real property and Seller's original
     purchase price (or basis, if applicable) for such real
     property (a "Real Property Transfer Gains Tax"), which
     shall be paid and borne by Seller.  Such payments shall
     not be treated as either an increase or reduction in
     Aggregate Consideration.  To the extent that Buyer,
     Seller or any Subsidiary is entitled to a refund of any
     Transfer Taxes paid pursuant to this Section 4.5(f), the
     party so entitled shall file for a refund of such Trans-
     fer Taxes, which refund shall be shared equally by Seller
     and Buyer; provided, however, that any refunds of Real
     Property Transfer Gains Taxes shall be solely for the
     account of the Seller.  The party that applies for such
     refund shall promptly pay over to the other party that
     other party's portion of such refund upon receipt thereof
     by the applying party (or any affiliate).
               (g)  On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser
     and Seller shall (to the extent required by law) com-
     plete, execute, deliver and verify any return, question-
     naire, affidavit, resale certificate, certificate of
     registration, or other document required in connection
     with any Tax, including but not limited to Transfer
     Taxes, relating to the sale of the Purchased Assets,
     including any pre-filing documents (including, without
     limitation, any filing required by the New York State
     real property transfer gains tax provisions).
               (h)  Any indemnification payments made pursuant
     to this Agreement, shall, to the extent permitted by
     applicable law, be treated as an adjustment to the pur-
     chase price.
               (i)  Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and
     the Seller shall agree to an allocation of the Aggregate
     Consideration among the Purchased Assets.  The Purchaser
     and the Seller represent, warrant and agree that the fair
     market values of the assets included in the Purchased
     Assets will be determined through arm's length negotia-
     tions, provided, however, that in no event shall the
     amount allocated to New York state real property (includ-
     ing, without limitation, land, buildings, fixtures and
     improvements) exceed $6,000,000.  Such allocation in any
     event shall comply with the requirements of Section 1060
     of the Code.  The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, to
     the extent permitted by applicable law, they shall file
     all income tax returns and reports in accordance with and
     based upon such allocation and shall take no position in
     any income tax return, proceeding or audit which is
     inconsistent with such allocation.  As used in this
     Section 4.5(i), the term "Aggregate Consideration" shall
     mean the sum of the Purchase Price paid pursuant to this
     Agreement and the amount of the Assumed Liabilities of
     the Seller and the Asset Subsidiaries, each as adjusted
     pursuant to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any other
     provision of this Agreement, the foregoing agreement
     shall survive the Closing Date without limitation.  Each
     of the Purchaser and the Seller shall timely file a
     federal form 8594 in accordance with the requirements of
     Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
               (j)  Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser such
     information as is necessary for the application of the
     incremental research credit provisions of Section
     41(f)(3)(A) of the Code.
               (k)     With respect to that certain Profit & Loss
     Pooling Agreement dated April 8, 1992 between Perkin-
     Elmer Holding GmbH Uberlingen (PEH) and Perkin-Elmer
     Metco GmbH Hattersheim (Metco Gmbh), Purchaser shall
     promptly reimburse Seller for any payment made by PEH to
     Metco GmbH pursuant to that agreement if such payments
     are made after the Closing Date due to the requirements
     of German law and the statutory audit.  Any such reim-
     bursement by Purchaser shall be considered an adjustment
     to the Purchase Price.  Seller shall cause PEH to prompt-
     ly reimburse Metco GmbH, or Purchaser shall cause Metco
     GmbH to reimburse PEH, as the case may be, for any amount
     due to or from either Metco GmbH or PEH with respect to
     the VAT account between PEH and Metco GmbH promptly after
     the determination thereof and in any case prior to the
     time for payment thereof.
               4.6  Preservation of Records.  The Purchaser
     agrees that it shall cause to be preserved and kept the
     records of the Seller Related to the Business delivered
     to it hereunder for a period of six (6) years from April
     15, 1995, or for any longer period as may be required by
     applicable law or in connection with any ongoing litiga-
     tion, and shall make such records (for the period of time
     referred to above) and employees of the Purchaser (for an
     unlimited period of time) available to the Seller as may
     be reasonably required by the Seller in connection with
     any legal proceedings involving, or governmental investi-
     gations or tax examinations of, the Seller.  In the event
     the Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after that
     time, it shall first give ninety (90) calendar days'
     prior written notice to the Seller and the Seller shall
     have the right at its option, upon notice given to the
     Purchaser within said 90-day period, to take possession
     of said records.
               4.7  Employee Benefits and Related Matters.
               (a)  Covenants of the Purchaser.  (i) Within a
     reasonable period of time prior to Closing, the Purchaser
     shall make offers of employment, which employment shall
     be effective as of the Closing Date and subject to con-
     summation at the Closing of the transactions contemplated
     hereby, to (X) every employee of the Division who is on
     the date hereof employed in the Business in the United
     States and who is listed on Schedule 4.7(a)(1) (the
     "United States Transferred Employees"), (Y) every em-
     ployee of the Division who is on the date hereof employed
     in the Business outside the United States by a Stock
     Subsidiary or an Asset Subsidiary and who is listed on
     Schedule 4.7(a)(1) (the "Foreign Transferred Employees"),
     and (Z) every other employee hired by the Division in the
     ordinary course of business from the date hereof to the
     Closing to be employed by the Division in the United
     States or in a foreign location and who will be listed on
     an amendment to Schedule 4.7(a)(1) which will be deliv-
     ered to the Purchaser prior to the Closing (the "New
     Transferred Employees").  The United States Transferred
     Employees, the Foreign Transferred Employees, and the New
     Transferred Employees are referred to herein collectively
     as the "Transferred Employees."  Such offers of employ-
     ment shall be at the job title and annual salary set
     forth opposite the respective Transferred Employees'
     names on Schedule 4.7(a)(1), as the same may be updated
     by the Seller from time to time prior to the Closing.  In
     addition, as part of its offer of employment to all
     Transferred Employees:  (A) the Purchaser shall offer a
     severance plan containing severance benefits payable upon
     any termination of such Transferred Employee's employment
     after the Closing as set forth in Schedule 4.7(a)(2)
     hereto (the "Purchaser Severance Plan"); (B) the Purchas-
     er shall offer such Transferred Employees such other
     terms and conditions set forth on Schedule 4.7(a)(2)
     hereto including the opportunity to participate in the
     other plans, arrangements, commitments, benefits and
     payroll practices (including severance, pension and
     welfare plans) set forth on Schedule 4.7(a)(2); (C) the
     Purchaser's medical plan shall not contain any exclusion
     or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condi-
     tions; (D) the Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser's
     medical plan to recognize any out-of-pocket medical and
     dental expenses incurred by Transferred Employees and
     their eligible dependents prior to the Closing Date and
     during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
     for purposes of determining the deductibles and out-of-
     pocket maximums applicable to such Transferred Employees;
     (E) the Purchaser shall credit each Transferred Employee
     for time of service with the Division and the Seller for
     purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (in-
     cluding vacation entitlement) under all such employee
     benefit plans maintained by the Purchaser (including,
     without limitation, the Purchaser Severance Plan); (F)
     for a period of two years following the Closing Date, the
     Purchaser will not reduce the benefits available under
     the Purchaser Severance Plan nor the aggregate level of
     employee benefits (when such benefits are considered as a
     whole) offered to such Transferred Employees; and (G)
     with respect to any Transferred Employee employed by the
     Division outside the United States, the Purchaser shall
     comply with all applicable legislation affecting such
     employee's rights upon a transfer of a business.  The
     Purchaser will give each Transferred Employee an opportu-
     nity to ask and have answered prior to the Closing any
     questions such Transferred Employee may have regarding
     the foregoing offer of employment and shall, if requested
     by the Seller, provide written confirmation to the Seller
     of such offers of employment.
               (ii)  Based upon (x) the Purchaser's review and
     analysis of all information provided by the Seller con-
     cerning the severance, pension, welfare and other em-
     ployment plans and policies currently being provided by
     the Seller to the United States Transferred Employees
     (the "Seller's United States Plans"), (y) discussions
     between the Purchaser's representatives and the Seller's
     representatives concerning the Seller's United States
     Plans, and (z) the Purchaser's review of the Seller's
     United States Plans, the Purchaser believes that the
     aggregate benefits to be provided by the Purchaser's
     severance, pension, welfare and other employment plans
     and policies to the United States Transferred Employees
     following the Closing (the "Purchaser's United States
     Plans") are comparable in the aggregate to the Seller's
     United States Plans.  The Purchaser agrees to offer the
     Seller reasonable cooperation and consultation in connec-
     tion with the Seller's supporting or defending the compa-
     rability of the Purchaser's United States Plans, includ-
     ing in connection with ordinary course communications
     with the United States Transferred Employees (including
     the introduction and explanation of the employee benefits
     provided by the Purchaser); grievances or complaints by
     the United States Transferred Employees in respect of
     such comparability; and administrative or judicial pro-
     ceedings commenced by a United States Transferred Employ-
     ee in respect of such comparability.  Such cooperation
     shall include making available employees and records of
     the Purchaser as reasonably requested by the Seller,
     providing information and analyses prepared by the Pur-
     chaser with respect to the Purchaser's comparability
     analysis and offering reasonable consultation to the
     Seller in connection with the Seller's defense of any
     administrative or judicial proceeding or employee griev-
     ance or complaint with respect to the comparability of
     employee benefits.  Notwithstanding the foregoing:
                       (1)  the provisions of this paragraph (a)
     shall not grant to any such persons any right to contin-
     ued employment if the Purchaser elects to terminate any
     such person's employment;
                       (2)  the severance benefits offered to any
     Transferred Employee and payable upon any termination of
     such Transferred Employee after the Closing shall be as
     set forth on the Purchaser Severance Plan;
                       (3)  except as otherwise expressly provid-
     ed herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
     construed to obligate the Purchaser to assume, provide,
     sponsor, maintain or contribute to any employee benefit
     plans, arrangements, commitments and payroll practices
     (whether or not such plan, arrangement, commitment or
     practice is an "employee benefit plan" as defined in
     Section 3(3) of ERISA), including, without limitation,
     with respect to sick leave, vacation pay, severance pay,
     salary continuation for disability, consulting or other
     compensation arrangements, retirement, deferred compensa-
     tion, bonus, incentive compensation, stock purchase,
     stock option, health including hospitalization, medical
     and dental, life insurance, scholarship plans or programs
     and "Multiemployer Plans" (as such term is defined by
     Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), maintained by the Seller
     for the benefit of any such Transferred Employees or to
     which the Seller has contributed or is or was obligated
     to make payments); and
                       (4)  the Purchaser shall not be required
     to offer employment to any employee of the Division who
     is receiving either short-term or long-term disability
     benefits under a short-term or long-term disability plan
     of the Seller or a Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, and
     such employee shall not be considered a Transferred
     Employee, unless and until such employee is able to
     resume active employment within one year after the Clos-
     ing Date.
               (b)  Severance Liability of the Purchaser.
     Notwithstanding any provisions of any severance or other
     similar plan maintained by the Seller for the benefit of
     any Transferred Employee, the Purchaser shall have no
     liability for any severance or other similar payment
     under any plan maintained by Seller to any Transferred
     Employee to whom it makes an offer of employment in
     conformity with the terms of Section 4.7(a), nor shall
     the Purchaser have any liability to the Seller for any
     severance or other similar payment to any Transferred
     Employee to whom the Purchaser makes such an offer of
     employment.  If the Purchaser fails to make an offer of
     employment in conformity with Section 4.7(a) to any
     Transferred Employee and if, by reason of such failure,
     the Seller is subject to an obligation for a severance or
     other similar payment to such Transferred Employee, the
     Purchaser shall discharge such obligation either by
     making such payment directly to the Transferred Employee
     or by reimbursing the Seller for such payment by the
     Seller.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser
     shall be liable for any severance or other similar pay-
     ment required to be made to any Transferred Employee
     under the terms of the Purchaser Severance Plan.  To the
     extent that any employment termination pay has been
     funded in Italy, the Seller shall transfer to the Pur-
     chaser the portion of the fund attributable to the Trans-
     ferred Employees employed by the Division in Italy to
     whom offers of employment have been made in conformity
     with Section 4.7(a) and accepted.
               (c)  For purposes of allocating responsibility
     for claims incurred by Transferred Employees and their
     covered dependents between the Seller's welfare plans and
     the Purchaser's welfare plans, the following rules shall
     apply (for purposes of this paragraph (c), references to
     the Seller and its plans shall, where appropriate, be
     references to the applicable Subsidiary and its plans):
               (i)  The Seller's short-term and long-term dis-
     ability plans shall continue to be responsible for long-
     term disability benefits payable to any Transferred
     Employee who is receiving short-term or long-term dis-
     ability benefits as of the Closing Date, until such time
     as such Transferred Employee resumes active employment
     with the Purchaser.  The Purchaser's short-term and long-
     term disability plans shall be responsible for all other
     disability benefits payable to Transferred Employees on
     and after the Closing Date.  Any period of short-term
     disability incurred by a Transferred Employee under the
     Purchaser's short-term disability plan shall count to-
     wards the waiting period for long-term disability bene-
     fits under the Purchaser's long-term disability plan.
               (ii)  With respect to all other welfare bene-
     fits, the Seller's plans shall be responsible for claims
     incurred by Transferred Employees and their covered
     dependents prior to the Closing Date, and the Purchaser's
     plans shall be responsible for claims incurred on and
     after the Closing Date.  A claim shall be deemed incurred
     when an individual obtains professional services, equip-
     ment or prescription drugs covered by a medical, pre-
     scription drug, dental or vision benefit plan, upon death
     in the case of a life insurance plan, and as of the date
     of the accident in the case of an accidental death and
     dismemberment plan.
               (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
     Seller's plans shall be responsible for the cost of all
     professional services, equipment and prescription drugs
     provided during a hospital stay or similar confinement of
     a Transferred Employee or his or her covered dependent
     that begins prior to the Closing Date and ends after the
     Closing Date (subject to the terms and conditions of the
     Seller's applicable plans), and the Purchaser's plans
     shall be responsible for the cost of all professional
     services, equipment and prescription drugs obtained by
     such Transferred Employee or covered dependent after the
     termination of such hospital stay or similar confinement
     (subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchaser's
     applicable plans).
               (d)  No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  No provi-
     sion of this Section 4.7 shall create any third-party
     beneficiary rights in any person or organization, includ-
     ing, without limitation, employees or former employees
     (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the
     Seller or the Purchaser or any of their respective affil-
     iates, unions or other representatives of such employees
     or former employees, or trustees, administrators, partic-
     ipants or beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan, and
     no provision of this Section 4.7 shall create such third-
     party beneficiary rights in any such person or organiza-
     tion in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
     directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan
     or arrangement, including the currently existing plans of
     the Seller or the Purchaser.
               4.8  Confidentiality.  The terms of the letter
     agreement dated as of September 14, 1993 (the "Confiden-
     tiality Agreement") between the Seller and the Purchaser
     are incorporated by reference herein and shall apply with
     full force and effect to the Purchaser for the term set
     forth therein; provided, however, that after the Closing,
     the Purchaser shall be free to use any confidential
     information Related to the Business in any manner that it
     desires.
               4.9  Use of Name.  On the Closing Date, the
     Purchaser shall cease using the name "Perkin-Elmer" or
     any variation thereof in connection with the operation of
     the Business or as part of any corporate, partnership or
     assumed name and shall file such documents as are neces-
     sary and appropriate to change any such corporate, part-
     nership or assumed name to a dissimilar name and shall
     promptly assume a dissimilar name for all purposes of the
     Business; provided, however, that for a period of one
     year from the Closing Date, the Purchaser may sell and
     distribute (a) all inventory existing on the Closing Date
     bearing the name "Perkin-Elmer" and (b) any inventory
     manufactured after the Closing Date with labels bearing
     the name "Perkin-Elmer" which were in stock or ordered on
     the Closing Date.
               4.10  Transition Services.  For a period of six
     (6) months following the Closing Date, the Seller shall
     make available to the Purchaser those support and admin-
     istrative services, including, without limitation, com-
     puter and data processing services and any software
     associated therewith, currently being provided by the
     Seller to the Business on a basis substantially consis-
     tent with the Seller's recent historical practice re-
     quested by the Purchaser.  The Purchaser will reimburse
     the Seller for the cost (including without limitation,
     any documented surcharges imposed by outside vendors) of
     such services promptly upon (but not more than thirty
     (30) calendar days following) the receipt of an invoice
     from the Seller therefor.
               4.11  Current Information.  During the period
     from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, the
     Seller will notify the Purchaser of any material change
     in the normal course of business or operations of the
     Business and the receipt of any governmental complaints,
     formal investigations or hearings (or communications
     indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
     institution or written threat or settlement of material
     litigation, in each case Related to the Business, and to
     keep the Purchaser fully informed of such events.
               4.12  Disclosure Supplements.  From time to
     time prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will promptly
     supplement or amend the Schedules made a part of this
     Agreement with respect to any matter hereafter arising
     which, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date
     of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
     forth or described in a Schedule hereto or which is
     necessary to correct any information in a Schedule hereto
     or in any representation and warranty of the Seller which
     has been rendered inaccurate thereby.  For purposes of
     determining the accuracy of the representations and
     warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement in
     order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set
     forth in Section 5.2(a), the Schedules delivered by the
     Seller shall be deemed to include only that information
     contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall
     be deemed to exclude any information contained in any
     subsequent supplement or amendment thereto.  For purposes
     of determining any liability of the Seller hereunder or
     otherwise after the Closing, the Schedules delivered
     hereunder shall be deemed amended by any information
     supplied by the Seller as contemplated by this Section
     4.12.
               4.13  Covenant Not to Compete.  (a)  The Seller
     agrees that it will not, for a period of five years fol-
     lowing the Closing Date, (i) directly or indirectly own,
     manage, operate, finance or participate in the ownership,
     management, operation or financing of, any business which
     is competitive with the Business, (ii) engage in any
     other manner in any business which is competitive with
     the Business, or (iii) induce or attempt to induce any
     customers, suppliers or distributors of the Division to
     terminate their relationships with the Business; pro-
     vided, however, that the Seller's compliance with Section
     4.10 shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 4.13.
               (b)  The Seller agrees that for a period of two
     years following the Closing Date, it will, and it will
     cause its officers, directors and employees to, keep se-
     cret and retain in confidence, and not at any time or for
     any reason, directly or indirectly (including but not
     limited to, acting by, through or with any subsidiary,
     affiliate, or any other person, firm, corporation, joint
     venture or agent), use, publish or disclose, any non-pub-
     lic and confidential information Related to the Business,
     except as required by law or the rules of an applicable
     stock exchange, and further, that the Seller will not use
     or exploit the same for its own benefit or with or for
     the benefit of others.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
     provisions of this Section 4.13(b), the Seller agrees
     that at all times following the Closing Date, it will,
     and it will cause its officers, directors and employees
     to, keep secret and retain in confidence, and not at any
     time or for any reason, directly or indirectly (including
     but not limited to, acting by, through or with any sub-
     sidiary, affiliate, or any other person, firm, corpora-
     tion, joint venture or agent), use, publish or disclose,
     any non-public and confidential information with respect
     to Intellectual Property except as required by law or the
     rules of an applicable stock exchange.  For the purposes
     of this Agreement, non-public and confidential informa-
     tion shall include, without limitation, customer lists,
     marketing plans and strategies, market studies and data,
     pricing policies and lists, manufacturing methods, speci-
     fications, processes and procedures, sources of supply,
     designs, the terms of contracts or agreements, know-how,
     trade secrets or any other information or data which is
     not public and of a confidential nature, Related to the
     Business.
               (c)  The Seller agrees that it will not, for a
     period of two years following the Closing Date, directly
     solicit the employment of any person who is at the time
     employed by the Business without the Purchaser's prior
     written consent.
               4.14  Title Commitment and Survey.  The Pur-
     chaser has ordered (at the cost and expense of the Pur-
     chaser) title commitments (as amended from time to time,
     the "Title Commitments") for each Owned Real Property
     located in the United States issued by Chicago Title
     Insurance Company (the "Title Company").  The Purchaser
     and the Seller shall mutually cooperate to obtain (at the
     sole cost and expense of the Purchaser) (i) updates of
     each Title Commitment from time to time prior to the
     Closing Date, and (ii) a survey or an updated survey de-
     picting each Owned Real Property located in the United
     States, with an ALTA/ASCM certification or its equivalent
     to Purchaser and the Title Company and otherwise in form
     reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and its counsel
     and the Title Company, prepared by a surveyor reasonably
     acceptable to the Purchaser licensed to practice in the
     state where such property is located (the "Survey").  If
     a Title Commitment or update shall reveal one or more
     defects to title not included as Permitted Encumbrances
     (the "Unpermitted Encumbrances"), Purchaser shall prompt-
     ly notify Seller of such Unpermitted Encumbrances and
     Seller shall (a) cure such Unpermitted Encumbrances which
     can be cured with the payment of money only ("Monetary
     Defects"); provided that the Seller shall not be obligat-
     ed to spend in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate (the
     "Monetary Defects Cure Cap") to cure such Monetary De-
     fects, except that the foregoing dollar limit shall not
     apply to Monetary Defects which were voluntarily placed
     upon the Owned Real Property by the Seller; and (b) shall
     use reasonable efforts to cure the Unpermitted Encum-
     brances which cannot be cured with the payment of money
     only ("Non-Monetary Defects") prior to Closing.  If,
     prior to the Closing, Seller is unable to cure the Non-
     Monetary Defects or is unable or unwilling to cure such
     Monetary Defects in excess of the Monetary Defects Cure
     Cap (the "Extraordinary Monetary Defects"), Purchaser
     shall have the option to either (i) consummate the trans-
     action contemplated by this Agreement, except that Pur-
     chaser shall not be obligated to acquire the particular
     Owned Real Property affected by the Non-Monetary Defects
     and there shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price
     equal to the value of that particular Owned Real Property
     as allocated by the parties, or (ii) consummate the
     transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including,
     without limitation, the acquisition of the particular
     Owned Real Property affected by the Non-Monetary Defects
     and/or the Extraordinary Monetary Defects with no adjust-
     ment to the Purchase Price, and such Non-Monetary Defects
     and/or such Extraordinary Monetary Defects shall be
     deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances.
               4.15  Releases of Guarantees.  The Purchaser
     agrees that it will either (i) cause the Seller to be re-
     leased as of the Closing Date from the guarantees listed
     on Schedule 4.15 hereto or (ii) indemnify the Seller with
     respect to any such guarantee from which the Seller is
     not released as of the Closing Date.
               4.16  Further Assurances.  At any time or from
     time to time after the Closing, either party shall, at
     the request of the other party, execute and deliver any
     further instruments and documents and take such further
     action as such party may reasonably request, in order to
     consummate and make effective the transactions contem-
     plated by this Agreement.
               4.17  Environmental Work.  Notwithstanding
     Section 6.4, Seller agrees that it will commence promptly
     after execution of this Agreement, and diligently pursue
     beyond the Closing Date, if necessary, at its own ex-
     pense, the environmental work with respect to the Real
     Property listed on Schedule 4.17 unless Seller determines
     on or prior to the Closing Date in its sole discretion
     that the cost of the remediation required as a result of
     the results of the samplings and soil borings referred to
     on the Schedule is material, in which case its sole
     option shall be to terminate this Agreement.

     chaser, in its reasonable judgment, that the transactions

     Exon-Florio Amendment and the GWB Act.
               (b)  All third party authorizations, approvals,
     consents, waivers and notices required in connection with
     the Purchase shall have been obtained, given or made
     except for such authorizations, approvals, consents,
     waivers and notices which, in the aggregate, will not
     have any significant adverse affect on the Business.
               (c)  No court or other governmental body or

     stantial damages by reason of completion of such transac-
     tion, or (iii) which will materially affect the right of
     the Purchaser to own, operate or control, after the
     Closing Date, the Business or any of the Purchased As-
     sets.
               (e)     Affiliates of each of the Seller and the

     (including the payment of the portion of the Purchase

     iate of the Purchaser).  Without limiting the foregoing,
     the agreement governing the sale of the capital stock of
     Metco GmbH, (the "Metco GmbH Purchase Agreement") shall
     be independent of and separate from this Agreement; and

     Price and payment of the Purchase Price hereunder shall
     constitute payment of the Metco GmbH Purchase Price.

     to Close.  The obligation of the Purchaser to consummate
     the Purchase shall be subject to the satisfaction, at or

               6.1  Survival of Representations.  Each repre-
     sentation and warranty of the Purchaser and the Seller
     made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive for a
     period of eighteen months following the Closing Date re-
     gardless of any investigation made at any time by or on
     behalf of either party, and thereafter neither party may
     make any claim for any breach of such representations and
     warranties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the represen-
     tations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1(a),
     3.1(b), 3.1(q), 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) shall survive in perpe-
     tuity and the representations and warranties set forth in
     Section 3.1(y) shall survive until the expiration of the

     forth therein.  All statements contained in this Agree-
     ment or in any schedule, certificate, list or other
     writing or document delivered or provided pursuant to
     this Agreement shall constitute representations and
     warranties as such term is used in this Agreement.  For
     purposes of indemnification claims pursuant to this
     Article VI, every representation and warranty made by
     either party shall be subject to every schedule, qualifi-
     cation and disclosure, and every amendment and supplement

     warranty at any time on or prior to the Closing Date.

     Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Pur-
     chaser and its affiliates and their respective directors,

     es, liabilities, amounts paid in settlement, costs and
     expenses, including, without limitation, interest, penal-
     ties and attorneys', consultants and expert witness fees,

     curred by any member of the Indemnified Purchaser Group
     directly or indirectly by reason of or resulting from:

     fillment of any representation or warranty of the Seller

     er of any covenant, commitment, undertaking or agreement
     contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or in-
     strument delivered pursuant to this Agreement;
               (iii)  any Excluded Liability; provided that
     with respect to any Losses relating to any individual
     liability a portion of which is an Excluded Liability and
     the balance of which is an Assumed Liability (because the
     underlying liability is a Product Liability), the Seller
     shall be responsible for only that percentage of all
     Losses relating to such liability equal to the ratio of
     the amount of the Excluded Liability to the sum of the

     ity, and the Purchaser shall be responsible for the
     balance of such Losses; and
               (iv)  any Unknown Liability; provided that the
     Seller shall be responsible for only

     omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under
     the Freedom of Information Act and has been filed separately with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission]

     the indemnity set forth in this clause (iv) shall termi-
     nate on the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.
               6.3  Indemnity by the Purchaser.  Upon the
     terms and subject to the conditions of this Article VI,
     the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
     the Seller and its affiliates and their respective direc-
     tors, officers and employees (collectively, the "Indemni-
     fied Seller Group") from and against all Losses asserted
     against, resulting to, or imposed upon or incurred by any
     member of the Indemnified Seller Group directly or indi-
     rectly by reason of or resulting from:
               (i)  the untruth, inaccuracy, breach or nonful-
     fillment of any representation or warranty of the Pur-
     chaser contained in this Agreement;
               (ii)  the breach or nonperformance by the Pur-
     chaser of any covenant, commitment, undertaking or agree-
     ment contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or
     instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement;
               (iii)  any Assumed Liability; provided that:
     (i) until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the
     Purchaser shall be responsible for only
     [material at this point has been
     omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under
     the Freedom of Information Act and has been filed separately with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission]
     of the total amount of all Losses related to any individual Unknown
     Liability, and the Seller shall be responsible for the remaining
     [material at this point has been
     omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under
     the Freedom of Information Act and has been filed separately with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission]
     of such Losses; thereafter, the Purchaser
     shall be responsible for 100% of such Losses; and (ii)
     with respect to any Losses relating to any individual
     liability a portion of which is an Assumed Liability and
     the balance of which is an Excluded Liability (because
     the underlying liability is a Product Liability), the
     Purchaser shall be responsible for only that percentage
     of all Losses relating to such liability equal to the
     ratio of the amount of the Assumed Liability to the sum
     of the amounts of the Assumed Liability and the Excluded
     Liability, and the Seller shall be responsible for the
     balance of such Losses;
               (iv)  any liability arising out of the opera-
     tion of the Business by the Purchaser after the Closing
     or the use of the Purchased Assets by the Purchaser after
     the Closing, provided that the indemnity set forth in
     this clause (iv) shall not apply to Excluded Liabilities,
     Environmental Liabilities, Product Liabilities or Unknown
     Liabilities; and
               (v)  any liability arising with respect to the
     Purchaser's use of the "Perkin-Elmer" name pursuant to
     Section 4.9 hereof.
               6.4  Environmental Indemnification.  In addi-
     tion to the parties' other obligations under this Article
     VI and subject to the provisions set forth below, the
     Seller and Purchaser agree to indemnify, defend and hold
     harmless each other from and against all Losses which may
     at any time during a period of fifteen years after the
     Closing Date be imposed upon, incurred by, or asserted or
     awarded against, the other based upon, arising out of or
     otherwise in respect of any Excluded Environmental Lia-
     bilities (in the case of the Seller as indemnitor) and
     any Assumed Environmental Liabilities (in the case of the
     Purchaser as indemnitor).  For purposes of Section 6.4,
     Losses shall include, without limitation, the costs of
     any Remedial Action but shall exclude any costs incurred
     by Seller pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.17.
     The parties' obligations under this Section 6.4 shall
     expire on the fifteenth anniversary of the Closing Date
     and thereafter, all such Losses as described in this
     Section 6.4 shall be the sole obligation of the Purchas-
     er.  In the event of a conflict between this Section 6.4
     and any of the other Sections of Article VI, this Section
     6.4 shall control.
               6.5  Procedures Relating to Environmental
     Indemnification.  In addition to the parties' other
     obligations under this Article VI, the following provi-
     sions shall apply and in the event of a conflict or
     ambiguity between this Section 6.5 and other Sections of
     Article VI, this Section 6.5 shall control.
               (a)  The Seller and Purchaser agree, so long as
     they each comply with their obligations to indemnify
     pursuant to Section 6.4, to reasonably cooperate with
     each other in managing and controlling all actions, in-
     cluding, without limitation, the defense of Environmental
     Claims and the conduct of Remedial Actions, undertaken in
     connection with their obligations to indemnify pursuant
     to Section 6.4.  In the event of an asserted Environmen-
     tal Claim, Seller and Purchaser shall provide their own
     defense each at their own cost and expense unless other-
     wise agreed by the parties.
               (b)  With respect to each condition requiring
     Remedial Action pursuant to Section 6.4, the Purchaser
     and Seller shall cooperate to undertake such Remedial
     Action as is reasonably necessary to achieve compliance
     with applicable Environmental Laws in effect on the
     Closing Date, including but not limited to, retaining an
     environmental professional that is acceptable to both
     Purchaser and Seller.  Purchaser and Seller's obligations
     under this Section 6.5 shall expire upon the receipt of
     either (i) a written statement by a governmental body
     with jurisdiction over the condition to the effect that
     compliance with such applicable Environmental Laws has
     been achieved or no further action is required under such
     applicable Environmental Laws or (ii) a written statement
     of an environmental professional mutually acceptable to
     the Purchaser and the Seller to the same effect.  In the
     event applicable Environmental Laws are amended or re-
     vised after the Closing Date, the Seller's obligations
     hereunder shall be limited to performance of Remedial
     Action only to the extent necessary to comply with appli-
     cable Environmental laws as in effect on the Closing Date
     and, in such case, the Seller shall deliver to the Pur-
     chaser a written opinion, addressed to the Purchaser, of
     an environmental professional that such compliance has
     been achieved or that no further action is required to
     comply with applicable Environmental Laws as in effect on
     the Closing Date.
               (c)  To the extent that the Purchaser or any
     affiliate is the occupant of the Real Property, the Pur-
     chaser will cooperate and will cause such affiliate to
     cooperate and, during normal business hours or at such
     other times as may be reasonably acceptable to the Pur-
     chaser, permit access to any entry upon the Real Property
     by the Seller as reasonably necessary to conduct any
     action in satisfaction of the Seller's obligations to
     indemnify pursuant to Section 6.5.
               (d)  The Purchaser and Seller shall promptly
     provide to each other copies of all scopes of work, final
     reports, correspondence with any governmental body and
     sampling data related to, or which result from, any
     Remedial Action at the Real Property and the Seller and
     Purchaser, as the case may be, shall each be given a
     reasonable opportunity to provide to the other written
     comments to such documents.
               (e)  As between the Purchaser and the Seller,
     the party providing indemnification pursuant to this
     Section 6.4 shall have no obligation to do so to the
     extent a written notice of claim has not been received on
     or before the fifteenth anniversary of the Closing Date.
               6.6  Indemnification Procedure.  The obliga-
     tions and liabilities of the Seller and the Purchaser, as
     the case may be, pursuant to Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and
     6.5, respectively (the indemnifying party being herein
     referred to as the "Indemnifying Party" and the indemni-
     fied group being referred to as the "Indemnified Group"),
     with respect to claims by third parties resulting in
     Losses that are subject to the indemnities in Sections
     6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 (individually, a "Third Party
     Claim" and collectively, "Third Party Claims") shall be
     subject to the following terms and procedures:
               (i) The member of the Indemnified Group to whom
     such Third Party Claim relates will give the Indemnifying
     Party prompt notice of such Third Party Claim, and the
     Indemnifying Party will assume the defense thereof by
     representatives chosen by it; provided that the Indemni-
     fied Group or the member thereof against which such Third
     Party Claim has been asserted shall be entitled to par-
     ticipate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to
     employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the han-
     dling of such Third Party Claim.
               (ii) If the Indemnifying Party, within a rea-
     sonable time after notice of any such Third Party Claim,
     fails or elects not to assume the defense thereof, the
     Indemnified Group or the member thereof against which
     such Third Party Claim has been asserted shall have the
     right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
     of such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the ac-
     count and at the risk of the Indemnifying Party, subject
     to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the
     defense of such Third Party Claim at any time prior to
     the settlement, compromise or final determination there-
     of.  Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified
     Group shall settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
     without the prior consent of the other (which consent
     will not be unreasonably withheld).
               (iii) For all purposes of this Section 6.6, in
     the case of any Third Party Claim asserting or alleging
     an Unknown Liability or a Product Liability (other than a
     Known Product Liability), the Purchaser shall be deemed
     the Indemnifying Party and the Seller group shall be
     deemed the Indemnified Group, whether such Third Party
     Claim is asserted against the Purchaser or the Seller but
     subject, however to the rights of any insurance carrier
     under the Seller's insurance policies.  In such cases the
     party against whom the Third Party Claim is asserted
     shall notify the other, and the Purchaser shall assume
     the defense thereof by representatives chosen by it.  All
     Losses resulting from any such Third Party Claim shall be
     borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller in the same
     proportion as their respective responsibilities for the
     liability giving rise to the Third Party Claim bear to
     one another notwithstanding whichever of them assumes the
     defense thereof.  The party which assumes the defense of
     any such Third Party Claim shall be entitled to be reim-
     bursed on a regular, periodic basis by the other party
     for the applicable percentage of the Losses incurred in
     connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim, as
     such Losses are incurred.
               6.7  Limitations on Indemnification. Neither
     party hereto shall have any liability to the other in
     respect of any claim for indemnification of Losses pursu-
     ant to this Article VI for the breach of any representa-
     tion or warranty contained herein until (and then only to
     the extent that) the Losses incurred by such Indemnified
     Group as a result of all such breaches of representations
     and warranties exceed an aggregate total of
     [material at this point has been
     omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under
     the Freedom of Information Act and has been filed separately with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission]
     and shall have no further obligation in respect of such
     Losses at such time as it shall have made aggregate
     payments equal to the amount of
     [material at this point has been
     omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under
     the Freedom of Information Act and has been filed separately with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission] million.
               6.8  Indemnity Not Exclusive Remedy.  Nothing
     contained in this Agreement shall prevent any party
     hereto from seeking and obtaining specific performance by
     the other party hereto of any of its obligations under
     this Agreement or from seeking and obtaining injunctive
     or other equitable relief against the other party's
     activities in breach of this Agreement or any other forms
     of relief or other remedies which may be available to it,
     either at law or in equity; provided, however, in the
     absence of actual or constructive fraud the exclusive
     remedy for breaches of representations and warranties set
     forth in this Agreement is indemnification provided for
     in Article VI.

                            ARTICLE VII
                            Termination
               7.1  Termination.  Notwithstanding anything in
     this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be
     terminated only (a) by the mutual written consent of the
     parties to this Agreement, (b) by the Purchaser or the
     Seller if, for any reason (other than breach of this
     Agreement by the terminating party), the Closing has not
     occurred (or cannot occur) on or prior to August 31,
     1994, (c) by the Seller pursuant to Section 4.17 hereof,
     or (d) by either party, on written notice to the other
     party, upon material breach of any covenant, representa-
     tion or warranty contained in this Agreement by the non-
     terminating party which has rendered the satisfaction of
     any condition to the obligations of the breaching party
     impossible and such violation or breach has not been
     waived by the terminating party; provided that the non-
     terminating party is first given notice of such breach
     and fails to remedy, or commit to remedying, such breach
     within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice.
               7.2  Effect of Termination.  If this Agreement
     is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement,
     other than with respect to the Purchaser's obligations
     under Section 4.4 and the Purchaser's and the Seller's
     obligations under Sections 4.8 and 8.1 hereof, shall
     thereafter have no effect, except that termination of
     this Agreement will not relieve either party of any
     liability for breach of any agreements hereunder occur-
     ring prior to such termination, provided that no supple-
     ment or amendment to any of the Schedules delivered by
     the Seller pursuant to Section 4.12 shall furnish a basis
     for liability of the Seller in the event that this Agree-
     ment is terminated.

                            ARTICLE VIII
                           Miscellaneous
               8.1  Expenses.  Except as otherwise specifical-
     ly provided herein, each party hereto shall bear its own
     expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and
     execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
     Purchase.
               8.2  Public Communications.  Except as may be
     required by applicable law or the rules of any applicable
     stock exchange, neither the Seller nor the Purchaser nor
     any of their respective affiliates shall issue any press
     release or other public communications relating to this
     Agreement or the Purchase without the prior written con-
     sent of the other party hereto.  In the event that any
     such press release or other public communication shall be
     required, the party required to issue such release or
     communication shall consult in good faith with the other
     party hereto with respect to the form and substance of
     such release or communication prior to the public dissem-
     ination thereof.
               8.3  Notices.  All notices, requests, demands
     and other communications required or permitted hereunder
     shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or
     sent by telecopier or by a nationally recognized over-
     night courier, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed to

     ness day after the date of deposit with such nationally
     recognized overnight courier. All such notices, requests,

     the respective parties at the addresses set forth below,

     herewith:

               8.4  Amendments; Waivers.  This Agreement may
     not be changed orally and no waiver of compliance with any
     provision or condition hereof and no consent provided for
     herein shall be effective unless evidenced by an instru-
     ment in writing duly executed by the proper party.  Either
     party may at any time waive compliance by the other party
     with any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement
     only by written instrument executed by the party waiving
     such compliance.  No such waiver, however, shall be deemed
     to constitute the waiver of any such covenant or condition
     in any other circumstance or the waiver of any other
     covenant or condition.
               8.5  Section Headings.  The section and para-
     graph headings contained in this Agreement are for refer-
     ence purposes only and shall not in any way affect the

     cuted in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
     deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
     constitute one and the same instrument.

     following sentence, this Agreement may not be assigned
     prior to the Closing, by operation of law or otherwise,
     and any attempt to do so shall be void.  The Purchaser may
     assign its rights under this Agreement in whole or in part
     to an affiliate or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pur-
     chaser; provided, however, that in such event, the Pur-
     chaser shall remain fully liable for the fulfillment of
     all of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall be
     binding upon and inure to the benefit of successors and
     assigns of the parties hereto.  No assignment by any party
     of any obligations under this Agreement shall release the
     assignor from such obligations without the written consent
     of the other party hereto.
               8.8  Bulk Sales.  The parties hereto agree to
     waive compliance with any bulk sales laws adopted by each
     of the jurisdictions in which Purchased Assets are located
     to the extent, if any, that such laws are applicable to
     the Purchase.  The Seller shall indemnify and hold harm-
     less the Purchaser against any and all liabilities which
     may be asserted by third parties against the Purchaser as
     a result of noncompliance with any such bulk sales laws.
               8.9  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be
     governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance
     with, the internal laws of the State of New York.
               8.10  Jurisdiction.  The Purchaser and the
     Seller hereby agree that any legal action or proceeding by
     either of them against the other arising out of or based
     upon this Agreement, the agreements, instruments and other
     documents delivered in connection herewith, or the trans-
     actions contemplated hereby or thereby, shall be brought
     in the courts of the State of New York or the United
     States of America sitting in the State of New York, and,
     by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Purchaser
     and the Seller accept and consent, generally and uncondi-
     tionally, to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree
     that such jurisdiction shall be exclusive, unless waived
     by both the Purchaser and the Seller in writing.  The
     Purchaser and the Seller irrevocably consent to the ser-
     vice of process in any action or proceeding in such courts
     by any means legally permissible, including, without
     limitation, by the mailing of such process, postage pre-
     paid, to either of them at the addresses set forth in this
     Agreement, such service by mail to become effective upon
     the earlier of (a) receipt of said mailing or (b) any
     earlier date permitted by applicable law.  The Purchaser
     and the Seller hereby waive any right to stay or to dis-
     miss any action or proceeding brought before said courts
     on the basis of forum non conveniens.
               8.11  Miscellaneous.  This Agreement (a) con-
     stitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
     agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
     among the parties with respect to the subject matter
     hereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agree-
     ment shall remain in full force and effect except as
     provided in Section 4.8 hereof; and (b) is not intended to
     confer upon any other persons any rights or remedies
     hereunder, and (c) is intended solely and exclusively for
     the benefit of the Seller and the Purchaser, and their
     permitted successors and assigns, respectively, and not
     for the benefit of any third party.  In case any provision
     in this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
     unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
     of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be af-
     fected or impaired thereby.
               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have
     caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the date
     first written above.

Mr. Gaynor Kelley
Chairman and CEO
The Perkin-Elmer Corporation
Norwalk, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Kelley,

     This will confirm our understanding with respect to the
closing of the sale of the Metco Division of The Perkin-
Elmer Corporation ("Perkin-Elmer") to Sulzer Inc.
("Sulzer").

     [Material at this point has been omitted pursuant to a
request for confidential treatment under the Freedom of
Information Act and has been filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission] the purchase price
payable by Sulzer for the Metco Division to the net book
value of the assets of the Division at closing, plus
[material at this point has been omitted pursuant to a
request for confidential treatment under the Freedom of
Information Act and has been filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission].  The net book value of
the assets will continue to be determined in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Purchase Agreement dated as of
April 18, 1994, as the same may be amended (the "Purchase
Agreement").  In addition, Perkin-Elmer will indemnify
Sulzer for certain losses incurred by Sulzer as a result of
compliance with the proposed consent order of the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") in its present form (the
"Consent Order"), as provided hereunder.  Perkin-Elmer will
also use its best efforts to close the sale at the earliest
possible date.

     On the seventh anniversary of the closing of this
transaction Sulzer, at its option, may request to meet with
Perkin-Elmer to review with Perkin-Elmer Sulzer's
calculation of legitimate damages it believes it incurred
solely as a result of the entry in the market of the new
supplier contemplated by the FTC Consent Order.  Perkin-
Elmer will meet with Sulzer at that time, review the data
provided and reimburse Sulzer for legitimate damages that
Sulzer demonstrates were incurred by it solely as a result
of the entry in the market of the new supplier contemplated
by the FTC Consent Order; however, in no event shall the
reimbursement to Sulzer for damages in this connection
exceed $5 mio.

     In consideration of this agreement by Perkin-Elmer,
Sulzer will:

     1.  Immediately sign and deliver to the FTC the Consent
Order, together with the proposed affidavit of Sumitomo
Chemical Company Limited in its present form.  Subject to
the foregoing, Sulzer will also use its best efforts to take
all steps necessary with respect to the FTC to ensure prompt
and satisfactory closing of the transaction and to comply
with the terms of the Consent Order.

     2.  Use its best efforts to close the sale at the
earliest possible date, including using its best efforts to
resolve any outstanding issues (including employee issues)
related to the purchase and sale of assets or stock outside
of the United States.

     3.  Waive any and all conditions to closing based upon:
(a) any changes to the Schedules to the Purchase Agreement
from the date of the Purchase Agreement to the date of
closing which are not, in the aggregate, material to the
financial condition of the Metco Division; (b) the failure
to receive any required governmental or other approvals,
other than the final approval of the German Cartel Office
under German antitrust law and the FTC; or (c) any alleged
deterioration of the Metco business generally.

     4.  Make no further claims (a) from and after the date
of the Final Statement contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement and determined in accordance with Section 2.4(b)
thereof, based on accounting methods and financial issues
related to any item or matter included or reflected on or
the subject of the Final Statement, and (b) at any time
either before or after the closing, based on or related to
any alleged deterioration of the business of Metco, or
losses or reduced profits allegedly based upon the signing
or enforcement of the Consent Order (other than pursuant to
the indemnification referred to above).

     In furtherance of the foregoing, Perkin-Elmer and
Sulzer agree that the representations and warranties of
Perkin-Elmer set forth in Section 3.1(g)(i) shall not
survive the closing and the representations and warranties
of Perkin-Elmer set forth in Sections 3.1(t) and 3.1(u)
shall survive only until the determination of the Final
Statement in accordance with Section 2.4(b) of the Purchase
Agreement.  All other representations and warranties shall
survive for the applicable period set forth in Section 6.1
of the Purchase Agreement.

     The "drop dead" date set forth in Section 7.1(b) of the
Purchase Agreement is hereby extended from August 31, 1994
to September 30, 1994.

     This letter shall have no further effect and neither
Perkin-Elmer nor Sulzer shall have any further obligations
hereunder if the FTC shall fail to accept the Consent Order
and affidavit contemplated by paragraph 1 of this letter.
     If you are willing to proceed on the basis set forth
above, please sign and return one copy of this letter to us.

                              Very truly yours,

                              Sulzer Inc.


                               By:    /s/ Fritz Fahrni  /s/ Roman Beran
                                          Fritz Fahrni      Roman Beran


Accepted and Agreed to this 31st day of August, 1994

stock of the Corporation owned by such Controlling Person

shall be made at a price exceeding the average price paid by

such Controlling Person for all shares of stock of the

Corporation acquired by such Controlling Person during the

two-year period preceding the date of such proposed purchase

unless such purchase is approved by the affirmative vote of

not less than a majority of the voting power of the shares

of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote held by

Disinterested Shareholders (as hereinafter defined).

          b.  The provisions of this Article ELEVENTH shall

not apply to (i) any offer to purchase made by the

Corporation which is made on the same terms and conditions

(ii) any purchase by the Corporation of shares owned by a

Controlling Person occurring after the end of two years

following the date of the last acquisition by such

accordance with the terms of any stock option or other

employee benefit plan now or hereafter maintained by the

Corporation, or (iv) any purchase by the Corporation of

shares of its stock at prevailing market prices pursuant to

a stock repurchase program.

          c.  Notwithstanding any other provision to the

contrary, the provisions of this Article ELEVENTH shall not

  Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the
  Borrower and the Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall
  have notified the Banks not later than the date of the Money
  Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute
  Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective), the
  Borrower shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or
  non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to
  subsection (e).  In the case of acceptance, such notice (a
  "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall specify the
  aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest
  Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may accept any Money
  Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

            (i)  the aggregate principal amount of each Money
         Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount
         set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request,

           (ii)  the principal amount of each Money Market
         Borrowing must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of
         $1,000,000,

          (iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the
         basis of ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market
         Absolute Rates, as the case may be, and

           (iv)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is
         described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise
         fails to comply with the requirements of this
         Agreement.

            (g)  Allocation by Agent.  If offers are made by
  two or more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or
  Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a
  greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in
  respect of which such offers are accepted for the related
  Interest Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans
  in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be
  allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as
  possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Agent may deem
  appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal
  amounts of such offers.  Determinations by the Agent of the
  amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the
  absence of manifest error.

            SECTION 2.04.  Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.

            (a)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the
  Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents
  thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing
  and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be
  revocable by the Borrower.

            (b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City
  time) on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating
  therein shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this
  Section) make available its share of such Borrowing, in
  Federal or other funds immediately available in New York
  City, to the Agent at its address referred to in Section
  9.01.  Unless the Agent determines that any applicable
  condition specified in Article III has not been satisfied,
  the Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks
  available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

            (c)  If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a
  day on which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an
  outstanding Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the
  proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
  amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount
  being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made
  available by such Bank to the Agent as provided in
  subsection (b), or remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as
  provided in Section 2.12, as the case may be.

            (d)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice
  from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such
  Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's share
  of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has
  made such share available to the Agent on the date of such
  Borrowing in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this
  Section 2.04 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
  assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
  corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank
  shall not have so made such share available to the Agent,
  such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the
  Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
  with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
  amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
  amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the
  Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the
  Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto
  pursuant to Section 2.07 and (ii) in the case of such Bank,
  the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Bank shall repay to the
  Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
  constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for
  purposes of this Agreement.

            SECTION 2.05.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank
  shall be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of
  such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office
  in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
  of such Bank's Loans.

            (b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and
  the Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type be
  evidenced by a separate Note in an amount equal to the
  aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each such
  Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto
  with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it
  evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  Each reference
  in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed
  to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the
  context may require.

            (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to
  Section 3.01(a), the Agent shall forward such Note to such
  Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date, amount, type and
  maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of
  each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect
  thereto, and may, if such Bank so elects in connection with
  any transfer or enforcement of its Note, endorse on the
  schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to
  evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such
  Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank
  to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect
  the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the
  Notes.  Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the
  Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a
  part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and
  when required.

            SECTION 2.06.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan
  included in any Borrowing shall mature, and the principal
  amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day of
  the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.07.  Interest Rates.  (a)  Each Base
  Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
  amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made
  until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base
  Rate for such day.  Such interest shall be payable for each
  Interest Period on the last day thereof.  Any overdue
  principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear
  interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a
  rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate
  otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.

            (b)  Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the
  outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during
  the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum
  equal to the sum of the CD Margin for such day plus the
  Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Interest Period;
  provided that if any CD Loan or any portion thereof shall,
  as a result of clause (2)(b) or (2)(c)(i) of the definition
  of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less than 30
  days, such portion shall bear interest during such Interest
  Period at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans during such
  period.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
  Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period
  is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the
  first day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on
  any CD Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each
  day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2%
  plus the higher of (i) the sum of the CD Margin for such day
  plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to the Interest Period
  for such Loan and (ii) the rate applicable to Base Rate
  Loans for such day.

            "CD Margin" means a rate per annum determined in
  accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

            The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest
  Period means a rate per annum determined pursuant to the
  following formula:


                     [ CDBR       ]*
            ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
                     [ 1.00 - DRP ]

            ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
            CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
             DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
              AR  =  Assessment Rate

       __________
       *  The amount in brackets being rounded upward, if
       necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%


            The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest
  Period is the rate of interest determined by the Agent to be
  the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next
  higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum bid at
  10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as
  practicable) on the first day of such Interest Period by two
  or more New York certificate of deposit dealers of
  recognized standing for the purchase at face value from each
  CD Reference Bank of its certificates of deposit in an
  amount comparable to the principal amount of the CD Loan of
  such CD Reference Bank to which such Interest Period applies
  and having a maturity comparable to such Interest Period.

            "Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day
  that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect
  on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the
  Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining
  the maximum reserve requirement (including without
  limitation any basic, supplemental or emergency reserves)
  for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York
  City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in respect
  of new non-personal time deposits in dollars in New York
  City having a maturity comparable to the related Interest
  Period and in an amount of $100,000 or more.  The Adjusted
  CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
  effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve
  Percentage.

            "Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual
  assessment rate in effect on such day which is payable by a
  member of the Bank Insurance Fund classified as adequately
  capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a
  comparable successor assessment risk classification) within
  the meaning of 12 C.F.R. section 327.3(d) (or any successor
  provision) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or
  any successor) for such Corporation's (or such successor's)
  insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the
  United States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted
  automatically on and as of the effective date of any change
  in the Assessment Rate.

            (c)  Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on
  the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day
  during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per
  annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such
  day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate
  applicable to such Interest Period.  Such interest shall be
  payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof
  and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at
  intervals of three months after the first day thereof.

            "Euro-Dollar Margin" means a rate per annum
  determined in accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

            The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate"
  applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum
  equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if
  necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i)
  the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00
  minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

            The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to
  any Interest Period means the average (rounded upward, if
  necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective
  rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered to
  each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London
  interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time)
  two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the first day of such
  Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the
  principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar
  Reference Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and
  for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period.

            "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day
  that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect
  on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the
  Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining
  the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the
  Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits
  exceeding five billion dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency
  liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
  liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which
  the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any
  category of extensions of credit or other assets which
  includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to
  United States residents).  The Adjusted London Interbank
  Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of
  the effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve
  Percentage.

            (d)  Any overdue principal of or interest on any
  Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for
  each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the higher
  of (i) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin for such
  day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate
  applicable to the Interest Period for such Loan and (ii) the
  sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the
  quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next
  higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (x) the average (rounded
  upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the
  respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such
  amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar
  Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer
  than six months as the Agent may select) deposits in dollars
  in an amount approximately equal to such overdue payment due
  to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks are offered to
  such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank in the London interbank
  market for the applicable period determined as provided
  above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage
  (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of
  Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the
  sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for
  such day).

            (e)  Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Money Market
  LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
  amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto,
  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank
  Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in
  accordance with Section 2.07(c) as if the related Money
  Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar
  Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by
  the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.
  Each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on
  the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest
  Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the
  Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such
  Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.  Such interest shall
  be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof
  and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at
  intervals of three months after the first day thereof.  Any
  overdue principal of or interest on any Money Market Loan
  shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until
  paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the
  Base Rate for such day.

            (f)  The Agent shall determine each interest rate
  applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give
  prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating Banks of
  each rate of interest so determined, and its determination
  thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
  error.

            (g)  Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best
  efforts to furnish quotations to the Agent as contemplated
  by this Section.  If any Reference Bank does not furnish a
  timely quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant
  interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations
  furnished by the remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if
  none of such quotations is available on a timely basis, the
  provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

            SECTION 2.08.  Fees.

            (a)  Commitment Fee.  During the Revolving Credit
  Period, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account
  of the Banks ratably in proportion to their Commitments a
  commitment fee at the Commitment Fee Rate (determined daily
  in accordance with the Pricing Schedule) on the daily amount
  by which the aggregate amount of the Commitments exceeds the
  aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans.  Such
  commitment fee shall accrue from and including the Effective
  Date to but excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date
  of termination of the Commitments in their entirety).

            (b)  Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the
  Agent for the account of the Banks ratably a facility fee at
  the Facility Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with
  the Pricing Schedule).  Such facility fee shall accrue (i)
  from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
  Termination Date (or earlier date of termination of the
  Commitments in their entirety), on the daily aggregate
  amount of the Commitments (whether used or unused) and (ii)
  from and including the Termination Date or such earlier date
  of termination to but excluding the date the Loans shall be
  repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate outstanding
  principal amount of the Loans.

            (c)  Payments.  Accrued fees under this Section
  shall be payable quarterly on each March 31, June 30,
  September 30 and December 31, and upon the date of
  termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if
  later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their
  entirety).

            SECTION 2.09.  Optional Termination or Reduction
  of Commitments.  During the Revolving Credit Period, the
  Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days'
  notice to the Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any
  time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time or (ii)
  ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of
  $10,000,000 or any larger multiple thereof, the aggregate
  amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate
  outstanding principal amount of the Loans.

            SECTION 2.10.  Scheduled Termination of
  Commitments.  The Commitments shall terminate on the
  Termination Date, and any Loans then outstanding (together
  with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on
  such date.

            SECTION 2.11.  Optional Prepayments.  (a)  Subject
  in the case of any Fixed Rate Borrowing to Section 2.13, the
  Borrower may, upon at least one Domestic Business Day's
  notice to the Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any
  Money Market Borrowing bearing interest at the Base Rate
  pursuant to Section 8.01(a)), upon at least three Domestic
  Business Days' notice to the Agent, prepay any CD Borrowing
  or upon at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to
  the Agent, prepay any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in each case in
  whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts
  aggregating $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of
  $1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid
  together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
  prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment shall be applied
  to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in
  such Borrowing.

            (b)  Except as provided in Section 2.11(a), the
  Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal
  amount of any Money Market Loan prior to the maturity
  thereof.

            (c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment
  pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall promptly notify
  each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable
  share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not
  thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

            SECTION 2.12.  General Provisions as to Payments.
  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of,
  and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later
  than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due,
  in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York
  City, to the Agent at its address referred to in Section
  9.01.  The Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its
  ratable share of each such payment received by the Agent for
  the account of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of principal
  of, or interest on, the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be
  due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date
  for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
  Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal
  of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a
  day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for
  payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
  Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business
  Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date
  for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar
  Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or
  interest on, the Money Market Loans shall be due on a day
  which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for
  payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
  Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any payment of
  principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise,
  interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

            (b)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice
  from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is
  due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make
  such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower
  has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and
  the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
  distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to
  the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that
  the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank
  shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
  distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for
  each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
  Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
  Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

            SECTION 2.13.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower
  makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed
  Rate Loan (pursuant to Article II, VI or VIII or otherwise)
  on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period
  applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period
  fixed pursuant to Section 2.07(d), or if the Borrower fails
  to borrow or prepay any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has
  been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.04(a) or
  2.11(c), the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15
  days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred
  by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the
  related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss
  incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits
  from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the
  period after any such payment or failure to borrow or
  prepay, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the
  Borrower a certificate as to the amount of such loss or
  expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in the
  absence of manifest error.

            SECTION 2.14.  Computation of Interest and Fees.
  Interest based on the Prime Rate hereunder shall be computed
  on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
  year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
  (including the first day but excluding the last day).  All
  other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a
  year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days
  elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
  day).

                              ARTICLE III

         Borrowing, the aggregate outstanding principal amount
         of the Loans will not exceed the aggregate amount of
         the Commitments;

            (c)  the fact that, immediately before and after
         such Borrowing, no Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing; and

            (d)  the fact that the representations and
         warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement

         4.04(c) and 4.05 as to any matter which has theretofore

  representation and warranty by the Borrower on the date of
  such Borrowing as to the facts specified in clauses (b), (c)

                              ARTICLE IV

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


            The Borrower represents and warrants that:

            SECTION 4.01.  Corporate Existence and Power.  The
  Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
  existing and in good standing under the laws of New York,
  and has all corporate powers and all material governmental
  licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
  carry on its business as now conducted.

            SECTION 4.02.  Corporate and Governmental
  Authorization; No Contravention.  The execution, delivery
  and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and the
  Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been
  duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require
  no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
  governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene,
  or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable
  law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or
  by-laws of the Borrower or of any agreement, judgment,
  injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon
  the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or
  result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
  asset of the Borrower or any of its Significant
  Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 4.03.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement
  constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower
  and each Note, when executed and delivered in accordance
  with this Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding
  obligation of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in
  accordance with its terms.

            SECTION 4.04.  Financial Information.

            (a)  The consolidated statement of financial
  position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
  as of June 30, 1993 and the related consolidated statements
  of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended,
  reported on by Price Waterhouse and set forth in the
  Borrower's 1993 Form 10-K, a copy of which has been
  delivered to each of the Banks, fairly present, in
  conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
  the consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its
  Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their
  consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such
  fiscal year.

            (b)   The unaudited consolidated statement of
  financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated
  Subsidiaries as of March 31, 1994 and the related unaudited
  consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the
  nine months then ended, set forth in the Borrower's Latest
  Form 10-Q, a copy of which has been delivered to each of the
  Banks, fairly present, in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with the
  financial statements referred to in subsection (a) of this
  Section, the consolidated financial position of the Borrower
  and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their
  consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such
  nine month period (subject to normal year-end adjustments).

            (c)  Since March 31, 1994 there has been no
  material adverse change in the business, financial position
  or results of operations of the Borrower and its
  Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.

            SECTION 4.05.  Litigation.  There is no action,
  suit or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of
  the Borrower threatened against or affecting, the Borrower
  or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or
  any governmental body, agency or official in which there is
  a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could
  materially adversely affect the business, consolidated
  financial position or consolidated results of operations of
  the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered
  as a whole, or which in any manner draws into question the
  validity of this Agreement or the Notes.

            SECTION 4.06.  Compliance with ERISA.  Each member
  of the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the
  minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue
  Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all
  material respects with the presently applicable provisions
  of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each
  Plan.  No member of the ERISA Group has (i) sought a waiver
  of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the
  Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to
  make any contribution or payment to any Plan or
  Multiemployer Plan or in respect of any Benefit Arrangement,
  or made any amendment to any Plan or Benefit Arrangement,
  which has resulted or could result in the imposition of a
  Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA
  or the Internal Revenue Code or (iii) incurred any liability
  under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC
  for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA.

            SECTION 4.07.  Environmental Matters.   In the
  ordinary course of its business, the Borrower reviews the
  effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and
  properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the
  course of which it identifies and evaluates associated
  liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any
  capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or
  closure of properties presently or previously owned, any
  capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or
  maintain compliance with environmental protection standards
  imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or
  contract, any related constraints on operating activities,
  including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility
  or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of
  operations conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in
  connection with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous
  Substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third
  parties, including employees, and any related costs and
  expenses).   On the basis of this review, the Borrower has
  reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and
  costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental
  Laws, are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the
  business, financial condition, results of operations or
  prospects of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries,
  considered as a whole.

            SECTION 4.08.  Taxes.  The Borrower and its
  Subsidiaries have filed all United States Federal income tax
  returns and all other material tax returns which are
  required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due
  pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment
  received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except taxes
  being contested in good faith and by appropriate
  proceedings.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the
  books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of
  taxes or other governmental charges are, in the opinion of
  the Borrower, adequate.

            SECTION 4.09.  Subsidiaries.  Each of the
  Borrower's Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
  incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
  the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all
  corporate powers and all material governmental licenses,
  authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on
  its business as now conducted.

            SECTION 4.10.  Not an Investment Company.  The
  Borrower is not an "investment company" within the meaning
  of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

            SECTION 4.11.  Full Disclosure.  All information
  heretofore furnished by the Borrower to the Agent or any
  Bank for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or
  any transaction contemplated hereby is, and all such
  information hereafter furnished by the Borrower to the Agent
  or any Bank will be, true and accurate in all material
  respects on the date as of which such information is stated
  or certified.  The Borrower has disclosed to the Banks in
  writing any and all facts which materially and adversely
  affect or may affect (to the extent the Borrower can now
  reasonably foresee), the business, operations or financial
  condition of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries,
  taken as a whole, or the ability of the Borrower to perform
  its obligations under this Agreement.


                               ARTICLE V

                               COVENANTS

         public accountants of nationally recognized standing;

            (b)  as soon as available and in any event within

         90 days after the acquisition thereof;

            (d)  any Lien on any asset of any corporation

         relief with respect to it or its debts under any
         bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
         hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a
         trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other
         similar official of it or any substantial part of its
         property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding
         shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of
         60 days; or an order for relief shall be entered
         against the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary
         under the federal bankruptcy laws as now or hereafter
         in effect;

            (i)  any member of the ERISA Group shall fail to
         pay when due an amount or amounts aggregating in excess
         of $5,000,000 which it shall have become liable to pay
         under Title IV of ERISA; or notice of intent to
         terminate a Material Plan shall be filed under Title IV
         of ERISA by any member of the ERISA Group, any plan
         administrator or any combination of the foregoing; or
         the PBGC shall institute proceedings under Title IV of
         ERISA to terminate, to impose liability (other than for
         premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA) in respect of, or
         to cause a trustee to be appointed to administer any
         Material Plan; or a condition shall exist by reason of
         which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree
         adjudicating that any Material Plan must be terminated;
         or there shall occur a complete or partial withdrawal
         from, or a default, within the meaning of Section
         4219(c)(5) of ERISA, with respect to, one or more
         Multiemployer Plans which could cause one or more
         members of the ERISA Group to incur a current payment
         obligation in excess of $5,000,000;

            (j)  judgments or orders for the payment of money
         in excess of $20,000,000 in the aggregate shall be
         rendered against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and
         such judgments or orders shall continue unsatisfied and
         unstayed for a period of 10 days; or

            (k)  any person or group of persons (within the
         meaning of Section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange
         Act of 1934, as amended) shall have acquired beneficial
         ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
         by the Securities and Exchange Commission under said
         Act) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of common
         stock of the Borrower; or, during any period of 12
         consecutive calendar months, individuals who were
         directors of the Borrower on the first day of such
         period shall cease to constitute a majority of the
         board of directors of the Borrower;

  then, and in every such event, the Agent shall (i) if
  requested by Banks having more than 50% in aggregate amount
  of the Commitments, by notice to the Borrower terminate the
  Commitments and they shall thereupon terminate, and (ii) if
  requested by Banks holding Notes evidencing more than 50% in
  aggregate principal amount of the Loans, by notice to the
  Borrower declare the Notes (together with accrued interest
  thereon) to be, and the Notes shall thereupon become,
  immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
  protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
  waived by the Borrower; provided that in the case of any of
  the Events of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above
  with respect to the Borrower, without any notice to the
  Borrower or any other act by the Agent or the Banks, the
  Commitments shall thereupon terminate and the Notes
  (together with accrued interest thereon) shall become
  immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
  protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
  waived by the Borrower.

            SECTION 6.02.  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall
  give notice to the Borrower under Section 6.01(c) promptly
  upon being requested to do so by any Bank and shall
  thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.


                              ARTICLE VII

                               THE AGENT


            SECTION 7.01.  Appointment and Authorization.
  Each Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to
  take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such
  powers under this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated
  to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with
  all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

            SECTION 7.02.  Agent and Affiliates.  Morgan
  Guaranty Trust Company of New York shall have the same
  rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and
  may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though
  it were not the Agent, and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
  New York and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
  money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with
  the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower
  as if it were not the Agent hereunder.

            SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agent.  The obligations
  of the Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth
  herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
  the Agent shall not be required to take any action with
  respect to any Default, except as expressly provided in
  Article VI.

            SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  The
  Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
  the Borrower), independent public accountants and other
  experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
  action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
  accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
  experts.

            SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agent.  Neither the
  Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective
  directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
  any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith
  (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks
  or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or
  willful misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
  affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers,
  agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any
  duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement,
  warranty or representation made in connection with this
  Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance
  or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the
  Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified
  in Article III, except receipt of items required to be
  delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness
  or genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes or any other
  instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith.  The
  Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance
  upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other
  writing (which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile
  transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be
  genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.

            SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall,
  ratably in accordance with its Commitment, indemnify the
  Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors,
  officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed
  by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including
  counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss
  or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees'
  gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such
  indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this
  Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees
  hereunder.

            SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank
  acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
  upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such
  documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
  its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
  Agreement.  Each Bank also acknowledges that it will,
  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any
  other Bank, and based on such documents and information as
  it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
  own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action
  under this Agreement.

            SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may
  resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and
  the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks
  shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If no
  successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
  Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30
  days after the retiring Agent gives notice of resignation,
  then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint
  a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
  organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of
  America or of any State thereof and having a combined
  capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the
  acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a
  successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
  succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties
  of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
  discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  After
  any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
  provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to
  any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
  Agent.

            SECTION 7.09.  Agent's Fee.  The Borrower shall
  pay to the Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and
  at the times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and
  the Agent.


                             ARTICLE VIII

                        CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


            SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate
  Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of
  any Interest Period for any Fixed Rate Borrowing:

            (a)  the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks
         that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts)
         are not being offered to the Reference Banks in the
         relevant market for such Interest Period, or

            (b)  in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks
         having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the
         Commitments advise the Agent that the Adjusted CD Rate
         or the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate, as the
         case may be, as determined by the Agent will not
         adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of
         funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the
         case may be, for such Interest Period,

  the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
  Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies
  the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
  suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to
  make CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be,
  shall be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent
  at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any
  Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has
  previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such
  date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed
  Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base
  Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a
  Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans
  comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day
  from and including the first day to but excluding the last
  day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base
  Rate for such day.

            SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  If, on or after the
  date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law,
  rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law,
  rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
  administration thereof by any governmental authority,
  central bank or comparable agency charged with the
  interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
  any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any
  request or directive (whether or not having the force of
  law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
  agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or
  its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund
  its Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the
  Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
  other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank
  notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
  giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
  obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be
  suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant
  to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different
  Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid
  the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
  judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
  Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully
  continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding
  Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such
  notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the
  then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar
  Loan, together with accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently
  with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower
  shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount
  from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be
  payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans
  of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base
  Rate Loan.

            SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return.
  (a)  If on or after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any
  Committed Loan or any obligation to make Committed Loans or
  (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case
  of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable
  law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable
  law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
  or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
  central bank or comparable agency charged with the
  interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
  any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request
  or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
  such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall
  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including,
  without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the
  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but
  excluding (i) with respect to any CD Loan any such
  requirement included in an applicable Domestic Reserve
  Percentage and (ii) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any
  such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar
  Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment
  (excluding, with respect to any CD Loan, any such
  requirement reflected in an applicable Assessment Rate) or
  similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
  the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its
  Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or
  its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United States
  market for certificates of deposit or the London interbank
  market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans,
  its Note or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans and the
  result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
  such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or
  maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of
  any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its
  Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its
  Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank
  to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such
  Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to
  such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
  compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

            (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after
  the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
  regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any
  such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
  interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
  authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
  the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request
  or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
  having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank
  or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
  reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its
  Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations
  hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its
  Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change,
  request or directive (taking into consideration its policies
  with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
  such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15
  days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent),
  the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount
  or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for
  such reduction.


            (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower
  and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge,
  occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such
  Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
  designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such
  designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
  of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
  Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A
  certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this
  Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts
  to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the
  absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such
  Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
  methods.

            SECTION 8.04.  Taxes.  (a)  For purposes of this
  Section 8.04, the following terms have the following
  meanings:

            "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes,
  duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings
  with respect to any payment by the Borrower pursuant to this
  Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with
  respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and
  the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or
  similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the
  laws of which such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) is
  organized or in which its principal executive office is
  located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its
  Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of
  each Bank, any United States withholding tax imposed on such
  payments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to
  United States withholding tax at the time such Bank first
  becomes a party to this Agreement.

            "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or
  documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or
  similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made
  pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the
  execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this
  Agreement or any Note.

            (b)  Any and all payments by the Borrower to or
  for the account of any Bank or the Agent hereunder or under
  any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or
  Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be
  required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any
  such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
  necessary so that after making all required deductions
  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
  under this Section 8.04) such Bank or the Agent (as the case
  may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
  received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
  shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the
  full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or
  other authority in accordance with applicable law and
  (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address
  referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified
  copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

            (c)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank
  and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
  (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes
  imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
  under this Section 8.04) paid by such Bank or the Agent (as
  the case may be) and any liability (including penalties,
  interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
  thereto.  This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days
  after such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) makes
  demand therefor.

            (d)  Each Bank organized under the laws of a
  jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the
  date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the
  case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and
  on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the
  case of each other Bank, and from time to time thereafter if
  requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as
  such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the
  Borrower with Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224, as
  appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the
  Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is
  entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the
  United States is a party which exempts the Bank from United
  States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding
  tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or
  certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this
  Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a
  trade or business in the United States.

            (e)  For any period with respect to which a Bank
  has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form
  pursuant to Section 8.04(d) (unless such failure is due to a
  change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to
  the date on which such form originally was required to be
  provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to
  indemnification under Section 8.04(b) or (c) with respect to
  Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank,
  which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate
  of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its
  failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower
  shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request
  to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

            (f)  If the Borrower is required to pay additional
  amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this
  Section 8.04, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of
  its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such
  Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such
  additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is
  not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

            SECTION 8.05.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for
  Affected Fixed Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any
  Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant
  to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
  under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect to its CD Loans or
  Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five
  Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through
  the Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section
  shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank
  notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
  such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist:

            (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by
         such Bank as CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case
         may be, shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on
         which interest and principal shall be payable
         contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of
         the other Banks), and

            (b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar
         Loans, as the case may be, has been repaid, all
         payments of principal which would otherwise be applied
         to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to
         repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

            SECTION 8.06.  Substitution of Bank.  If (i) the
  obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been
  suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has
  demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, the
  Borrower shall have the right, with the assistance of the
  Agent, to seek a mutually satisfactory substitute bank or
  banks (which may be one or more of the Banks) to purchase
  the Note and assume the Commitment of such Bank.


                              ARTICLE IX

  this Section; provided that notices to the Agent under
  Article II or Article VIII shall not be effective until
  received.

            SECTION 9.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by
  the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or
  privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a
  waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
  thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
  the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The
  rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
  not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

            SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The
  Borrower shall pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the
  Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel
  for the Agent, in connection with the preparation and
  administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent
  hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged

  Bank, including (without duplication) the fees and
  disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of
  inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and
  collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement
  proceedings resulting therefrom.

            (b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent
  and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the
  respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the
  foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee
  harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
  damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without
  limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
  counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in
  connection with any investigative, administrative or
  judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be
  designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating
  to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or
  proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that
  no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified
  hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or
  willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
  jurisdiction.

            SECTION 9.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank
  agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off
  or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a
  proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest
  due with respect to any Note held by it which is greater
  than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of
  the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with
  respect to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank
  receiving such proportionately greater payment shall
  purchase such participations in the Notes held by the other
  Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be
  required so that all such payments of principal and interest
  with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared
  by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section
  shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of
  set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount
  subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of
  the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder.  The
  Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do
  so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation
  in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing
  arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim
  and other rights with respect to such participation as fully
  as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor
  of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            SECTION 9.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any
  provision of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or
  waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
  writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks
  (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected
  thereby, by the Agent); provided that no such amendment or
  waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase
  or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable
  decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any
  Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal
  of, accrued interest on, or rate of interest on any Loan or
  any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
  payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees
  hereunder or for any reduction or termination of any
  Commitment, (iv) change the aggregate amount by which or to
  which the Commitments are required to be reduced on or prior
  to any Commitment Reduction Date or (v) change the
  percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid
  principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which
  shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any
  action under this Section or any other provision of this
  Agreement.

            SECTION 9.06.  Successors and Assigns. (a)  The
  provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
  to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
  successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
  assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this
  Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks.

            (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more
  banks or other institutions (each a "Participant")
  participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of
  its Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a
  participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon
  notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain
  responsible for the performance of its obligations
  hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
  deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with
  such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
  Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a
  participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall
  retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the
  obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without
  limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification
  or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
  such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will
  not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this
  Agreement described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of
  Section 9.05 without the consent of the Participant.  The
  Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent
  provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the
  benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating
  interest.  An assignment or other transfer which is not
  permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given
  effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of
  a participating interest granted in accordance with this
  subsection (b).

            (c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or
  more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all,
  or a proportionate part of all, of its rights and
  obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and such
  Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant
  to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially
  the form of Exhibit G hereto executed by such Assignee and
  such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the subscribed
  consent of the Borrower and the Agent; provided that if an
  Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a
  Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent
  shall be required; and provided further that such assignment
  may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in
  respect of outstanding Money Market Loans.  Upon execution
  and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee
  to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase
  price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee,
  such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and
  shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a
  Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption,
  and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
  obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no
  further consent or action by any party shall be required.
  Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this
  subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the
  Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if
  required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee.  In
  connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank
  shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing
  such assignment in the amount of $2,500.  If the Assignee is
  not incorporated under the laws of the United States of
  America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower
  and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction
  or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in
  accordance with Section 8.04.

            (d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any
  portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a
  Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release the
  transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

            (e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee
  of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any
  greater payment under Section 8.03 or 8.04 than such Bank
  would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
  rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the
  Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the
  provisions of Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.04 requiring such Bank
  to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under
  certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances
  giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

            SECTION 9.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks
  represents to the Agent and each of the other Banks that it
  in good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as
  defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or
  maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.08.  Governing Law; Submission to
  Jurisdiction.  This Agreement and each Note shall be
  governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
  State of New York.  The Borrower hereby submits to the
  nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District
  Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New
  York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of
  all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this
  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  The
  Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
  by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
  the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
  such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought
  in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

            SECTION 9.09.  Counterparts; Integration.  This
  Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each
  of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
  the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
  instrument.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
  and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes
  any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
  written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

            SECTION 9.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE
  BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
  ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused
  this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
  authorized officers as of the day and year first above
  written.

                      OPINION OF WILLIAM B. SAWCH
                       COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER







  To the Banks and the Agent
    Referred to Below
  c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
    of New York, as Agent
  60 Wall Street
  New York, New York  10260

  Dear Sirs:

            I am Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
  of, and have acted as counsel to, The Perkin-Elmer
  Corporation (the "Borrower") in connection with the Three-
  Year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of
  June 1, 1994 among the Borrower, the banks listed on the
  signature pages thereof and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
  New York, as Agent.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement
  are used herein as therein defined.  This opinion is being
  rendered to you at the request of my client pursuant to
  Section 3.01(c) of the Credit Agreement.

            I, or persons acting under my supervision, have
  examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
  identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate
  records, certificates of public officials and other
  instruments and have conducted such other investigations of
  fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for
  purposes of this opinion.

            Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the
  opinion that:

            1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly
  incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
  the laws of New York, and has all corporate powers and all
  material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
  approvals required to carry on its business as now
  conducted.

            2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
  Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within
  the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized
  by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or
  in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency
  or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default
  under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of
  the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower
  or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or
  other instrument known by me to be binding upon the Borrower
  or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or result in the
  creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the
  Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries.

            3.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and
  binding agreement of the Borrower and each Note constitutes
  a valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, in each case
  enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same
  may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
  affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
  principles of equity.

            4.  There is no action, suit or proceeding pending
  against, or to the best of my knowledge threatened against
  or affecting, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before
  any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
  official, in which there is a reasonable possibility of an
  adverse decision which could materially adversely affect the
  business, consolidated financial position or consolidated
  results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
  Subsidiaries, considered as a whole or which in any manner
  draws into question the validity of the Credit Agreement or
  the Notes.

            5.  Each of the Borrower's Significant
  Subsidiaries is a corporation validly existing and in good
  standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
  incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material
  governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
  approvals required to carry on its business as now
  conducted.

                              Very truly yours,

                              OPINION OF
                DAVIS POLK & WARDWELL, SPECIAL COUNSEL
                               FOR THE AGENT







  To the Banks and the Agent
    Referred to Below
  c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
    of New York, as Agent
  60 Wall Street
  New York, New York  10260

  Dear Sirs:

            We have participated in the preparation of the
  Three-Year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated
  as of June 1, 1994 among The Perkin-Elmer Corporation, a New
  York corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks listed on the
  signature pages thereof (the "Banks") and Morgan Guaranty
  Trust Company of New York, as Agent (the "Agent"), and have
  acted as special counsel for the Agent for the purpose of
  rendering this opinion pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the
  Credit Agreement.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are
  used herein as therein defined.

            We have examined originals or copies, certified or
  otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents,
  corporate records, certificates of public officials and
  other instruments and have conducted such other
  investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary
  or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

            Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the
  opinion that:

            1.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
  Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within
  the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly
  authorized by all necessary corporate action.

            2.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and
  binding agreement of the Borrower and each Note constitutes
  a valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, in each case
  enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same
  may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
  affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
  principles of equity.

            We are members of the Bar of the State of New York
  and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the
  State of New York and the federal laws of the United States
  of America.  In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no
  opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any
  jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any
  Bank is located which limits the rate of interest that such
  Bank may charge or collect.

            This opinion is rendered solely to you in
  connection with the above matter.  This opinion may not be
  relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by
  any other person without our prior written consent.

                                Very truly yours,

            WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement
  (the "Agreement") relates to the Three-Year Credit Agreement
  dated as of June 1, 1994 among the Borrower, the Assignor
  and the other Banks party thereto, as Banks, and the Agent
  (the "Credit Agreement");

            WHEREAS, as provided under the Credit Agreement,
  the Assignor has a Commitment to make Loans to the Borrower
  in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not
  to exceed $__________;

            WHEREAS, Committed Loans made to the Borrower by
  the Assignor under the Credit Agreement in the aggregate
  principal amount of $__________ are outstanding at the date
  hereof; and

            WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the
  Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit
  Agreement in respect of a portion of its Commitment
  thereunder in an amount equal to $__________ (the "Assigned
  Amount"), together with a corresponding portion of its
  outstanding Committed Loans, and the Assignee proposes to
  accept assignment of such rights and assume the
  corresponding obligations from the Assignor on such terms;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
  and the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties
  hereto agree as follows:

            SECTION 1.  Definitions. All capitalized terms not
  otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
  set forth in the Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 2.  Assignment.  The Assignor hereby
  assigns and sells to the Assignee all of the rights of the
  Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the
  Assigned Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such
  assignment from the Assignor and assumes all of the
  obligations of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement to
  the extent of the Assigned Amount, including the purchase
  from the Assignor of the corresponding portion of the
  principal amount of the Committed Loans made by the Assignor
  outstanding at the date hereof.  Upon the execution and
  delivery hereof by the Assignor, the Assignee[, the Borrower
  and the Agent] and the payment of the amounts specified in
  Section 3 required to be paid on the date hereof (i) the
  Assignee shall, as of the date hereof, succeed to the rights
  and be obligated to perform the obligations of a Bank under
  the Credit Agreement with a Commitment in an amount equal to
  the Assigned Amount, and (ii) the Commitment of the Assignor
  shall, as of the date hereof, be reduced by a like amount
  and the Assignor released from its obligations under the
  Credit Agreement to the extent such obligations have been
  assumed by the Assignee.  The assignment provided for herein
  shall be without recourse to the Assignor.

            SECTION 3.  Payments.  As consideration for the
  assignment and sale contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the
  Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the date hereof in
  Federal funds the amount heretofore agreed between them. It

  with, and shall have no responsibility with respect to, the
  solvency, financial condition, or statements of the

  obligations of the Borrower in respect of the Credit
  Agreement or any Note.  The Assignee acknowledges that it
  has, independently and without reliance on the Assignor, and
  based on such documents and information as it has deemed
  appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to
  enter into this Agreement and will continue to be
  responsible for making its own independent appraisal of the
  business, affairs and financial condition of the Borrower.

            SECTION 6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall

                          CONTRACT




     AGREEMENT entered into as of the 29th day of July, 1974

between THE PERKIN-ELMER CORPORATION, a New York corporation

having its principal place of business at Norwalk,

Connecticut (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and

GAYNOR N. KELLEY of New Canaan, Connecticut (hereinafter

referred to as "Kelley" or the "Employee").

     WHEREAS, Kelley has rendered the Company valuable

services and it is regarded as essential by the Company that

it shall have the benefit of his services during future

years, and

     WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Company to assist him

in providing for the contingencies of death and old age

dependency, and

     WHEREAS, it appears desirable to provide for retirement

at an age prior to the current normal retirement age of 65

years in appropriate cases so as to facilitate an orderly

succession in senior management positions of the Company,

     NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby mutually agreed as

follows:

     (1)  Should Kelley still be in the employ of the

Company at age 65, his normal retirement age, the Company

(beginning on a date to be determined by the Company but

within 6 months from such date) will pay him annually for a

continuous period of 10 years an amount equal to $8,000.00.

Payment of this amount shall be made in quarterly

installments on the first days of the fiscal quarters of the

Company

     Should the Employee be in the employ of the Company at

age 65 and thereafter die but before the entire said 10

annual payments have been paid, the unpaid balance of the 10

annual payments will continue to be paid by the Company to

the beneficiary.

     (2)  Should the Employee die before age 65 while in the

employ of the Company, the Company (beginning on a date to

be determined by the Company but within 6 months from the

date of death) will pay annually for a continuous period of

10 years $8,000.00.  Payment of this amount shall be made in

quarterly installments on the first days of the fiscal

quarters of the Company.  Payments shall be made to his

beneficiary.

     (3)  If the Employee shall retire on or after age 60

and before age 65, with the written consent or at the

request of the Company, payments will be made by the Company

in the amount and in the manner provided in Paragraph (1) to

commence within 6 months of the date of retirement.

     (4)  Should the Employee's employment be terminated at

any time after the date hereof and prior to his attaining

age 60, with the written consent or by the act of the

Company, the Company will make payments in the manner

provided in Paragraph (1) to him or his beneficiary

commencing at age 60 or the date of his prior death in an

amount determined by multiplying the benefit set forth in

Paragraph (1) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be

the number of whole months or major part thereof of

employment from the date hereof to the date of termination

of employment, and the denominator of which shall be the

number of whole months or major part thereof from the date

hereof to the date he attains age 60.

     (5)  Unless the Company shall consent in writing, the

Employee, if his employment be terminated other than by

death or disability or as provided in Paragraphs (3) or (4)

prior to his attaining age 65, shall forfeit all right to

benefits hereunder and the Company shall have no liability

for any payment to the Employee or a beneficiary.

     (6)  In the event the Employee shall become disabled so

that he is unable to perform his duties as an Employee and

so that he is entitled to benefits under a long range

disability insurance program made available by the Company,

or so that he would have been eligible for such benefits had

he elected to insure himself thereunder, the Company will

make payments as provided in Paragraph (1) above to commence

at age 65.

     In the event the Employee should die at any time after

becoming disabled and before attaining age 65, payments as

provided in this Paragraph (6) will be made to his

designated beneficiary commencing as of the date of the

Employee's death.

     (7)  The Company has or may procure a policy or

policies of life insurance upon the life of the Employee to

aid it in meeting its obligations under this Agreement.  It

is understood, however, that such policy or policies held by

the Company and the proceeds therefrom shall be treated as

the general assets of the Company; that they shall in no way

represent any vested, secured, or preferred interest of the

Employee or his beneficiaries under this Agreement; and that

the Company shall be under no obligation either to procure

or to continue life insurance in force upon the life of the

Employee.

     The Employee hereby agrees that he already has or will

submit to a physical examination and answer truthfully and

completely without mental reservation or concealment any

question or request for information by any insurance company

in connection with the issuance of any policy procured by

the Company under this Paragraph (7).  In the event the

Employee fails to do so or in the event the Employee dies by

suicide, and the liability of the insurer under such policy

is restricted as a result of such failure or suicide, then

the Company shall thereby be released from all of its

obligations under Paragraph (2) above.

     (8) If the Company shall procure any policy or policies

of life insurance in accordance with Paragraph (7) above and

shall have the option of including in any such policy an

accidental death or so-called "double indemnity" provision,

the Company will so advise the Employee and if the Employee

requests and agrees to pay any additional premium resulting

therefrom will include in the policy such accidental death

or double indemnity provisions as may be available and will

further provide or cause to be provided that any benefit

payable under or by reason of such provisions shall be paid

as a death benefit to the beneficiary designated by the

Employee hereunder; provided that in the event the Employee

shall cease to pay such additional premium the Company may

cancel any accidental death or double indemnity provision;

and further provided that the inclusion of such a provision

shall in no way affect the Company's right to cancel or

otherwise dispose of the policy, even though such action may

have the effect of terminating such provision.

     (9)  If during a period of 10 years from the

termination of his employment by the Company the Employee

shall engage in a business competitive with any business

activity engaged in by the Company during his period of

employment, including without limitation, designing or

manufacturing scientific instruments, electro-optical

systems, precision optics or electronic devices similar to

or in competition with those produced by the Company or any

subsidiary or affiliate thereof; or enter into the service

of any organization so engaged in such business (or any

subsidiary or affiliate of such an organization), or

personally engage in or enter the service of any

organization that is engaged in consulting work or research

or development or engineering activities for any

organization so engaged in such business (or any subsidiary

or affiliate of such an organization); then any liability of

the Company to make any further payments hereunder shall

cease.

     The investment of funds by the Employee in securities

of a corporation listed on a recognized stock exchange shall

not be considered to be a breach of the above paragraph.

     (10)  The Company may in its sole discretion grant the

Employee a leave of absence for a period not to exceed one

year during which time the Employee will be considered to be

still in the employ of the Company for the purposes of this

Agreement.

     (11)  The Company in its sole discretion and without

the consent of the Employee, his estate, beneficiaries or

any other person claiming through or under him, may commute

any payments which are due hereunder at the rate of 4% per

annum to a lump sum and pay such lump sum to the Employee or

to the beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to receive

payment at the date of commutation and such payment shall be

a full discharge of the Company's liabilities hereunder.

The Company may also in its sole discretion and without the

consent of any other person accelerate the payment of any of

the sums payable hereunder.

     (12)  The right to receive payments under this

Agreement shall not be assignable nor subject to

anticipation, nor shall such right be subject to

garnishment, attachment or any other legal process of

creditors of the Employee or of any person or persons

designated as beneficiaries hereunder except to the extent

that this provision may be contrary to law.

     (13)  This Agreement creates no rights in the Employee

to continue in the employ of the Company for any length of

time nor does it create any rights in the Employee or

obligations on the part of the Company other than those set

forth herein.

     For purposes of the contract, the work "beneficiary"

shall mean the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated in

writing by the Employee.  The Employee may change a

beneficiary at any time by written notice to the Company

which shall take effect only on its receipt and

acknowledgment in writing by the Company.

     (14)  If the Company, or any corporation surviving or

resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the

Company may be a party or to which substantially all the

assets of the Company shall be sold or otherwise

transferred, shall at any time be merged or consolidated

with or into any other corporation or corporations or shall

otherwise transfer substantially all its assets to another

corporation, the terms and provisions of this Agreement

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the

corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or

consolidation or to which such assets shall be so sold or

otherwise transferred.  Except as hereinafter provided, this

Agreement shall not be assignable by the Company or by the

Employee.

     This Agreement is solely between the Company and the

Employee.  The Employee and his beneficiaries designated

under Paragraph (2) above shall have recourse only against

the Company for enforcement and the Agreement shall be

binding upon the beneficiaries, heirs, executors and

administrators of the Employee and upon the successors and

assigns of the Company.

     This Agreement has been made, executed and delivered in

the State of Connecticut; and shall be governed in

accordance with the laws thereof.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have set their

hands and affixed the seal of the Corporation this 29th day

of July 1974.

                              ACCEPTED AND AGREED:

                             TO
               DEFERRED COMPENSATION CONTRACT

     Amended Agreement entered into as of the 21st day of

May, 1987, between THE PERKIN-ELMER CORPORATION,  a New York

Corporation having its principal place of business at

Norwalk, Connecticut (hereinafter referred to as the

"Company"), and Gaynor N. Kelley of 1801 Ponus Ridge Road,

New Canaan, Connecticut 06840 (hereinafter referred to as

the "Employee").

     WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement entered into as of

July 29, 1974 between the Company and the Employee

(hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement), the Company

agreed to make certain payments to the Employee (or his

beneficiary) in the event of the Employee's retirement or

death;

     NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby mutually agreed that

Paragraph (5) of the Agreement is amended, effective as of

the date hereof, by amending the second paragraph thereof in

its entirety to read as follows:



        Notwithstanding any other provision of this
   Agreement, if within three years of a Change in Control
   the employment of Employee is terminated by the Employee
   for Good Reason or by the Company without Cause, then the
   Company will pay Employee the amount referred to in
   Paragraph (1) of this Agreement within 60 days of such
   termination of employment.  For purposes hereof:

          (a)  A "Change in Control" shall have occurred if
     (i) any "person" within the meaning of Section 14(d) of
     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 becomes the
     "beneficial owner" as defined in Rule 13d-3 thereunder,
     directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the
     Company's Common Stock, (ii) any "person" acquires by
     proxy or otherwise, other than pursuant to
     solicitations by the Incumbent Board (as hereinafter
     defined), the right to vote more than 35% of the
     Company's Common Stock for the election of directors,
     for any merger or consolidation of the Company or for
     any other matter or questions, (iii) during any two
     year period, individuals who constitute the Board of
     Directors of the Company (the "Incumbent Board") as of
     the beginning of the period cease for any reason to
     constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that
     any person becoming a director during such period whose
     election or nomination for election by the Company's
     stockholders was approved by a vote of at least three-
     quarters of the Incumbent Board (either by a specific
     vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the
     Company in which such person is named as a nominee for
     director without objection to such nomination) shall
     be, for purposes of this clause (iii), considered as
     though such person were a member of the Incumbent
     Board, or (iv) the approval by the Company's
     stockholders of the sale of all or substantially all of
     the assets of the Company.

          (b)  Termination by the Company of the employment
     of the Employee for "Cause" shall mean termination upon
     (i) the willful and continued failure by the Employee
     to perform substantially his duties with the Company
     (other than any such failure resulting from the
     Employee's incapacity due to physical or mental
     illness) after a demand for substantial performance is
     delivered to the employee by the Chairman of the Board
     or President of the Company which specifically
     identifies the manner in which such executive believes
     that the Employee has not substantially performed his
     duties, or (ii) the willful engaging by the Employee in
     illegal conduct which is materially and demonstrably
     injurious to the Company.  For purposes of this
     subparagraph (b), no act, or failure to act, on the
     part of the Employee shall be considered "willful"
     unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee in
     bad faith and without reasonable belief that the
     Employee's action or omission was in, or not opposed
     to, the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or
     failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to
     a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon
     the advice of counsel for the Company shall
     conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be
     done, by the Employee in good faith and in the best
     interests of the Company.  Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, the Employee shall not be deemed to have
     been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall
     have been delivered to the Employee a copy of a
     resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not
     less than three-quarters of the entire membership of
     the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for
     the purpose (after reasonable notice to the employee
     and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel,
     to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good
     faith opinion of the Board the Employee was guilty of
     the conduct set forth above in (i) or (ii) of this
     subparagraph (b) and specifying the particulars thereof
     in detail.

          (c)  Termination by the employee of employment for
     "Good Reason" shall mean termination based on:

          (i)  an adverse change in the status of the
     Employee (other than any such change primarily
     attributable to the fact that the Company may no longer
     be publicly owned) or position(s) as an officer of the
     Company as in effect immediately prior to the Change in
     Control, or the assignment to the Employee of any
     duties or responsibilities which, in his reasonable
     judgement, are inconsistent with such status or
     position(s), or any removal of the Employee from or any
     failure to reappoint or reelect him to such position(s)
     (except in connection with the termination of the
     Employee's employment for Cause, total disability or
     retirement on or after attaining age 65 or as a result
     of death or by the Employee other than for Good
     Reason);

          (ii)  a reduction by the Company in the Employee's
     base salary as in effect immediately prior to the
     Change in Control;

          (iii)  A material reduction in the Employee's
     total annual compensation; a reduction for any year of
     over 10% of total compensation measured by the
     preceding year without a substantially similar
     reduction to other executives shall be considered
     "material"; provided, however, the failure of the
     Company to adopt or renew a stock option plan or to
     grant stock options to the Employee shall not be
     considered a reduction; and

          (iv)  the Company's requiring the employee to be
     based more than fifty miles from Norwalk, Connecticut,
     except for required travel on the Company's business to
     an extent substantially consistent with the business
     travel obligations which he undertook on behalf of the
     Company prior to the change of Control.

     All other provisions of the Agreement not amended

herein shall remain in full force and effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed

this instrument as of the year and day first above written.

                 DEFERRED COMPENSATION CONTRACT





   AGREEMENT entered into as of February 18, 1993, between THE

PERKIN-ELMER CORPORATION, a New York corporation having its

principal place of business at Norwalk, Connecticut (hereinafter

referred to as the "Company") and Andre F. Marion, of 556

Kingsley Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301 (hereinafter referred to as

the "Employee").

   WHEREAS, the Employee has rendered valuable service to the

Company, and it is regarded as essential by the Company that it

shall have the benefit of his services during future years, and

   WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Company to assist the

Employee in providing for the contingencies of death and old age

dependency, and

   WHEREAS, it appears desirable to provide for retirement at an

age prior to the current normal retirement age of 65 years in

appropriate cases so as to facilitate an orderly succession in

senior management positions of the Company.

   NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby mutually agreed as follows:



        (1)  Should the Employee still be in the employ of the

   Company at age 65, the Company (beginning on a date to be

   determined by the Company but within 6 months from the

   Employee's retirement date) will pay him $25,000 each year

   for a continuous period of 10 years.  Payment of this amount

   shall be made in quarterly installments on the first day of

   the fiscal quarters of the Company.

             Should the Employee be in the employ of the Company

   at age 65 and thereafter die before the entire said 10 annual

   payments have been paid, the unpaid balance of the 10 annual

   payments will continue to be paid by the Company to that

   person designated by the Employee in a written notice of

   election as the Employee's beneficiary hereunder (hereinafter

   referred to as the  "Beneficiary").  The Employee may change

   such designation at any time by giving the Company written

   notice of such intent; and such change shall become effective

   only upon being received and acknowledged by the Company.

             If the Beneficiary shall die after receiving

   benefits under this Agreement and further payments are

   payable, such further payments shall be paid to the estate of

   the Beneficiary.  If the Employee shall survive the

   Beneficiary without designating another Beneficiary, any

   payments hereunder shall be paid to the estate of the

   Employee.

             The Employee may elect in writing at any time prior

   to his normal retirement date one of the following optional

   forms of payment in lieu of the normal form of payment set

   forth above, with the annual value of such optional form of

   payment being actuarially reduced from such normal form of

   payment; provided, however, that such optional forms of

   payment are not available to an Employee in the event he dies

   or terminates his employment and is covered by Paragraphs

   (2), (4), (5), or (6) of this Agreement:

      Option 1.  Reduced annual payments payable during his life

      with the provision that if he shall not survive a period

      of ten years, such reduced annual payments shall continue

      to be paid after the death of the Employee and during the

      remainder of such ten-year period to the Beneficiary.

      Option 2.  Reduced annual payments payable during his

      life, with the provision that after his death such reduced

      annual payments shall continue during the life of, and

      shall be paid to the

      Beneficiary (provided the Beneficiary survives the

      Employee).

      Option 3.  Reduced annual payments payable during his

      life, with the provision that after his death annual

      payments equal to 50% of such reduced annual payments

      shall continue during the life of, and shall be paid to,

      the Beneficiary (provided the Beneficiary survives the

      Employee).

      Option 4.  Reduced annual payments payable to the Employee

      during his life.

            Notwithstanding any contrary provisions herein, the

  Employee may not change his Beneficiary in Options 2 and 3,

  above, after the Employee has begun to receive payments

  hereunder.

        (2)  Should the Employee die before age 65 while in the

   employ of the Company, the Company (beginning on a date to be

   determined by the Company but within 6 months from the date

   of death) will pay the Beneficiary $25,000 each year for a

   continuous period of 10 years.  Payment of this amount shall

   be made in quarterly installments on the first day of the

   fiscal quarters of the Company.

        (3)  If the Employee shall retire on or after age 60 and

   before age 65, with the written consent or at the request of

   the Company, payments will be made by the Company in the

   amount and in the manner provided in Paragraph (1) to

   commence within 6 months of the date of retirement.

        (4)  Should the Employee's employment be terminated at

   any time after the date hereof and prior to his attaining age

   60, with the written consent or by the act of the Company,

   the Company will make payments in the manner provided in

   Paragraph (1) to commence when the Employee attains age 60 or

   the date of his prior death in an amount determined by

   multiplying the benefit set forth in Paragraph (1) by a

   fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of whole

   months or major part thereof from the date hereof to the date

   of termination of employment, and the denominator of which

   shall be the number of whole months or major part thereof

   from the date hereof to the date he attains age 60.

        (5)  Unless the Company shall consent in writing, the

   Employee, if his employment be terminated other than by death

   or disability or as provided in Paragraphs (3) or (4) prior

   to his attaining age 65, shall forfeit all right to benefits

   hereunder and the Company shall have no liability for any

   payment to the Employee or the Beneficiary.  Notwithstanding

   any other provision of this Agreement, if within three years

   of a Change in Control the employment of the Employee is

   terminated by the Employee for Good Reason or by the Company

   without Cause, then the Company will pay Employee the amount

   referred to in Paragraph (1) of this Agreement within 60 days

   of such termination of employment.  For purposes hereof:

  (a)A "Change in Control" shall have occurred if (i) any

      "person" within the meaning of Section 14 (d) of the

      Securities Exchange Act of 1934 becomes the "beneficial

      owner" as defined in Rule 13d-3 thereunder, directly or

      indirectly, of more than 25% of the Company's Common Stock,

      (ii) any "person" acquires by proxy or otherwise, other

      than pursuant to solicitations by the Incumbent Board (as

      hereinafter defined), the right to vote more than 35% of

      the Company's Common Stock for the election of directors,

      for any merger or consolidation of the Company or for any

      other matter or question, (iii) during any two-year period,

      individuals who constitute the Board of Directors of the

      Company (the "Incumbent Board") as of the beginning of the

      period cease for any reason to constitute at least a

      majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a

      director during such period whose election or nomination

      for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by

      a vote of at least three-quarters of the Incumbent Board

      (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy

      statement of the Company in which such person is named as a

      nominee for director without objection to such nomination)

      shall be, for purposes of this clause (iii), considered as

      though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board, or

      (iv) the Company's Stockholders approve the sale of all or

      substantially all of the assets of the Company.

  (b)Termination by the Company of the employment of the

      Employee for "Cause" shall mean termination upon (i) the

      willful and continued failure by the Employee to perform

      substantially his duties with the Company, (other than any

      such failure resulting from the Employee's incapacity due

      to physical or mental illness) after a demand for

      substantial performance is delivered to the employee by

      the Chairman of the Board or President of the Company

      which specifically identifies the manner in which such

      executive believes that the Employee has not substantially

      performed his duties, or (ii) the willful engaging by the

      Employee in illegal conduct which is materially and

      demonstrably injurious to the Company.  For purposes of

      this subparagraph (b), no act or failure to act on the

      part of the Employee shall be considered "willful" unless

      done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee in bad faith

      and without reasonable belief that the Employee's action

      or omission was in, or not opposed to, the best interests

      of the  Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon

      authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by

      the Board or based upon the advice of counsel for the

      Company shall conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted

      to be done, by the Employee in good faith and in the best

      interests of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,

      the Employee shall not be deemed to have been  terminated

      for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered

      to the Employee a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by

      the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of

      the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the

      Board called and held for that purpose (after reasonable

      notice to the employee and an opportunity for him,

      together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board),

      finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board the

      Employee was guilty of the conduct set forth in sections

      (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph (b) and specifying the

      particulars thereof in detail.

  (c)Termination by the employee of employment for "Good

      Reason" shall mean termination based on:

      (i) an adverse change in the status of the Employee (other

          than any such change primary attributable to the fact

          that the Company may no longer be publicly owned) or

          the Employee's position(s) as an officer of the Company

          as in effect immediately prior to the Change in

          Control, or the assignment to the Employee of any

          duties or responsibilities which, in his reasonable

          judgement, are inconsistent with such status or

          position(s), or any removal of the Employee from, or

          any failure to reappoint or reelect him to, such

          position(s) (except in connection with the termination

          of the Employee's employment for Cause, total

          disability, or retirement on or after attaining age 65

          or as a result of death or by the Employee other than

          for Good Reason);

      (ii)     a reduction by the Company in the Employee's base

          salary as in effect immediately prior to the Change in

          Control;

      (iii)   A material reduction in the Employee's total

          annual compensation; a reduction for any year of over

          10% of total compensation measured by the preceding

          year without a substantially similar reduction to other

          executives shall be considered "material"; provided,

          however, the failure of the Company to adopt or renew a

          stock option plan or to grant stock options to the

          Employee shall not be considered a reduction; and

      (iv)     the Company's requiring the employee to be more

          than fifty miles from Norwalk, Connecticut, except for

          required travel on the Company's business to an extent

          substantially consistent with the business travel

          obligations which he undertook on behalf of the Company

          prior to the Change in Control.

        (6)  In the event the Employee shall become disabled so

   that he is unable to perform his duties as an employee and so

   that he is entitled to benefits under a long range disability

   insurance program made available by the Company, or so that

   he would have been eligible for such benefits had he elected

   to insure himself thereunder, the Company will make payments

   as provided in Paragraph (1) above to commence at age 65.  In

   the event the Employee should die at any time after becoming

   disabled and before attaining age 65, payments as provided in

   this Paragraph (6) will be made to the Beneficiary commencing

   as of the date of the Employee's death.

        (7)  The Company has or may procure a policy or policies

   of life insurance upon the life of the Employee to aid it in

   meeting its obligations under this Agreement.  It is

   understood, however, that such policy or policies held by the

   Company and the proceeds therefrom shall be treated as the

   general assets of the Company; that they shall in no way

   represent any vested, secured, or preferred interest of the

   Employee or his beneficiaries under this Agreement; and that

   the Company shall be under no obligation either to procure or

   to continue life insurance in force upon the life of the

   Employee.

             The employee hereby agrees that he already has or

   will submit to a physical examination and answer truthfully

   and completely without mental reservation or concealment any

   question or request for information by any insurance company

   in connection with the issuance of any policy procured by the

   Company under this Paragraph. (7).  In the event the Employee

   fails to do so or in the event the Employee dies by suicide,

   and the liability of the insurer under such policy is

   restricted as a result of such failure or suicide, then the

   Company shall thereby be released from all of its obligations

   under Paragraph (2) above.

        (8)  If the Company shall procure any policy or policies

   of life insurance in accordance with Paragraph (7) above and

   shall have the option of including in any such policy an

   accidental death or so-called "double indemnity" provision,

   the Company will so advise the Employee and, if the Employee

   requests and agrees to pay any additional premium resulting

   therefrom, will include in the policy such accidental death

   or double indemnity provisions as may be available and will

   further provide or cause to be provided that any benefit

   payable under or by reason of such provisions shall be paid

   as a death benefit to the beneficiary designated by the

   Employee hereunder; provided that in the event the Employee

   shall cease to pay such additional premium the Company may

   cancel any accidental death or double indemnity provision;

   and further provided that the inclusion of such a provision

   shall in no way affect the Company's right to cancel or

   otherwise dispose of the policy, even though such action may

   have the effect of terminating such provision.

        (9)  If during a period of 10 years from the termination

   of his employment with the Company the Employee shall: engage

   in a business competitive with any business activity engaged

   in by the Company at any time while he was employed; enter

   into the service of any organization so engaged in such

   business (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such an

   organization); or personally engage in or enter the service

   of any organization that is engaged in consulting work or

   research or development or engineering activities for any

   organization so engaged in such business (or any subsidiary

   or affiliate of such an organization), then any liability of

   the Company to make any further payments hereunder shall

   cease.  The investment of funds by the Employee in securities

   of a corporation listed on a recognized stock exchange shall

   not be considered to be a breach of this Paragraph.

        (10)  The Company may in its sole discretion grant the

   Employee a leave of absence for a period not to exceed one

   year during which time the Employee will be considered to be

   still in the employ of the Company for the purposes of this

   Agreement.

        (11)  The Company in its sole discretion and without the

   consent of the Employee, his estate, his beneficiaries, or

   any other person claiming through or under him, may commute

   any payments which are due hereunder at the rate of 4% per

   annum to a lump sum and pay such lump sum to the Employee or

   to the beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to receive

   payment at the date of commutation, and such payment shall be

   a full discharge of the Company's liabilities hereunder.  The

   Company may also in its sole discretion and without the

   consent of any other person accelerate the payment of any of

   the sums payable hereunder.

        (12)  The right to receive payments under this Agreement

   shall not be assignable or subject to anticipation, nor shall

   such right be subject to garnishment, attachment, or any

   other legal process of creditors of the Employee or of any

   person or persons designated as beneficiaries hereunder

   except to the extent that this provision may be contrary to

   law.

        (13)  This Agreement creates no rights in the Employee

   to continue in the employ of the Company for any length of

   time nor does it create any rights in the Employee or

   obligations on the part of the Company other than those set

   forth herein.

        (14)  If the Company, or any corporation surviving or

   resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the

   Company may be a party or to which substantially all the

   assets of the Company shall be sold or otherwise transferred,

   shall at any time be merged or consolidated with or into any

   other corporation or corporations or shall otherwise transfer

   substantially all its assets to another corporation, the

   terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon

   and inure to the benefit of the corporation surviving or

   resulting from such merger or consolidation or to which such

   assets shall be so sold or otherwise transferred.  Except as

   herein provided, this Agreement.  This Agreement is solely

   between the Company and the Employee.  The Employee and his

   beneficiaries shall have recourse only against the Company

   for enforcement, and the Agreement shall be binding upon the

   beneficiaries, heirs, executors, and administrators of the

   Employee and upon the successors and assigns of the Company.

        (15)  This Agreement has been made, executed, and

   delivered in the State of Connecticut; and shall be governed

   in accordance with the laws thereof.


   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have set their hands

and affixed the seal of the Corporation as of the date first

written above.

November 1, 1990



Dear Andre Marion:
In view of your position as a Corporate Senior Manager at
Applied Biosystems Inc. (the "Company"), and in
consideration of your services in such capacity, the Board
of Directors (the "Board") has approved the commitment by
the Company to you ("Employee") to provide you with the
certain benefits in the event your employment is terminated
for specified reasons within two years after a Change of
Control.  The purpose of this letter agreement (the
"Agreement") is to set forth the terms and conditions of the
Company's agreement with you concerning such benefits.

   1.  Termination of Benefits.  If within two years after
the date of a Change of Control, Employee's employment is
terminated (a) by the Company for any reason other than for
Cause or Employee's death or Disability or (b) by Employee
for Good Reason, Employee will be entitled to receive the
following benefits:

     1.1  Salary Continuation.  The Company will continue to
pay Employee salary at the annual rate equal to Employee's
Annual Compensation for the number of weeks determined by
adding (a) the number of years Employee has been an employee
of the Company (rounding up to the next full year and
excluding any intervening periods during which Employee was
not an employee) or two, if greater, plus (b) two and one-
half times the number of $5,000 increments (rounded up to
the next $5,000 increment) contained in the Employee's
Annual Compensation.  Continued salary will be paid to
Employee on the Company's regular paydays during the period
of salary continuation and will be subject to applicable
withholding taxes.  If Employee should die before receiving
all amounts payable to Employee hereunder, any unpaid
amounts will be paid to Employee's spouse, if living,
otherwise to Employee's estate.  Employee shall be entitled
to receive interest on any amount payable hereunder from the
date payment was due to the date actually paid at the rate
of the lesser of 12% or the highest rate legally
permissible.  Employee will not be required to mitigate the
amount of the payments due to Employee hereunder by seeking
other employment or otherwise, and any amount earned by
Employee as the result of employment by another employer or
otherwise after the Date of Termination shall not reduce the
Company's obligation to Employee hereunder.

     1.2  COBRA Benefits.  The Company will pay for
Employee's health insurance continuation benefits provided
for under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1986 ("COBRA") and Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 until the earliest of (a) eighteen months after
the Date of Termination, (b) the last payday on which the
Company is obligated to make a payment to Employee pursuant
to paragraph 1.1 above or (c) the date on which Employee
first becomes eligible to participate in another health
insurance plan.  The insurance continuation benefits paid
for hereunder shall be deemed to be part of Employee's COBRA
coverage.

     1.3  Offset for Other Arrangements.  The severance
benefits provided hereunder will be reduced by the amount of
any payment to which Employee may be entitled under any
severance plan or policy of the Company or under any
individual severance agreement, employment agreement or
offer letter.

   2.  Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause or by Employee for Good Reason shall be
communicated by written notice to the other party given by
hand delivery or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, if to Employee, then to
Employee at his or her address as set forth in the Company's
records, and, if to the Company, to Applied Biosystems,
Inc., 777 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, California
94404, Attention:  Andre F. Marion.  Any notices given
pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall be effective the earlier
of when such notice is actually received by the addressee or
three days after such notice is delivered or sent.

   3.  Definitions.

     3.1  "Annual Compensation"  means all wages, salary,
bonus and other incentive compensation (including
commissions) paid by the Company as consideration for
Employee's service during the 12 months ended on either the
Termination Date or the date of the Change of Control,
whichever is greater, which are includable in the gross
income of Employee for federal income tax purposes.

     3.2  "Cause"  means (a) gross or habitual failure to
perform assigned duties of Employee's job, that is,
performance failure not corrected within thirty (30) days
after written notice to Employee thereof or (b) misconduct,
including but not limited to:  (i) conviction of a crime, or
entry of a plea of nolo contendere with regard to a crime,
involving moral turpitude or dishonesty, or (ii) drug or
alcohol abuse on Company premises or at a Company sponsored
event or reporting to or remaining at work while under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, or (iii) conduct by Employee
which in the good faith and reasonable determination of the
Board demonstrates gross unfitness to serve.

     3.3  "Change of Control"  shall be deemed to have
occurred at any of the following times:

    i. Upon the acquisition (other than from the Company)
        by any person, entity or "group," within the meaning
        of Section 13(d) (3) or 14(d) (2) of the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")
        (excluding, for this purpose, the Company or its
        affiliates, or any employee benefit plan of the
        Company or its affiliates which acquires beneficial
        ownership of voting securities of the Company) of
        beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-
        3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 50% or more
        of either the then outstanding shares of common
        stock or the Combined Voting Power; or

    ii.At the time individuals who, as of October 31, 1990,
        constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease
        for any reason to constitute at least a majority of
        the Board, provided that any person becoming a
        director subsequent to October 31, 1990 whose
        election, or nomination for election by the
        Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at
        least a majority of the directors then comprising
        the Incumbent Board (other than an election or
        nomination of an individual whose initial assumption
        of office is in connection with an actual or
        threatened election contest relating to the election
        of the Directors of the Company, as such terms are
        used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated
        under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of
        the Plan, considered as though such person were a
        member of the Incumbent Board; or

     iii.   Immediately prior to the consummation by the
        Company of a reorganization, merger, consolidation
        (in each case, with respect to which persons who
        were the shareholders of the Company immediately
        prior to such reorganization, merger or
        consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, own
        more than 50% of the Combined Voting Power of the
        reorganized, merged or consolidated company's then
        outstanding voting securities) or a liquidation or
        dissolution of the Company or of the sale of all or
        substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

    iv.The occurrence of any other event which the
        Incumbent Board in its sole discretion determines
        constitutes a Change of Control.

     3.4  "Combined Voting Power" means the combined voting
power of the Company's then outstanding securities
ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under special
circumstances ) having the right to vote at elections of
directors.

     3.5  "Date of Termination" means the date of receipt of
the written notice of termination pursuant to paragraph 2 or
any later date specified therein, as the case may be;
provided, however, that (1.) if Employee's employment is
terminated by the Company other than for Cause or by reason
of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which the Company notifies Employee of such
termination and (2.) if Employee's employment is terminated
by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination
shall be the date of death or determination of Disability
pursuant to paragraph 3.6 , as the case may be.

     3.6  "Disability" means disability which, at least 26
weeks after its commencement, is determined to be total and
permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its
insurers and acceptable to Employee or Employee's legal
representative (such acceptance not to be unreasonably
withheld).

     3.7  "Good Reason" means (i) reduction of Employee's
base salary or rate of compensation as in effect immediately
prior to the Change of Control, (ii) failure to continue in
effect any medical, dental, accident or disability plan in
which Employee is entitled to participate immediately prior
to the Change of Control and failure to provide plans with
substantially similar benefits (except that employee
contributions may be raised to the extent of any cost
increases imposed by third parties) or any action by the
Company which would adversely affect Employee's
participation or reduce Employee's benefits under any of
such plans, (iii) failure or refusal of the successor
company to assume the Company's obligations under this
Agreement, as required by paragraph 5 or (iv) breach by the
Company or any successor company any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

   4.  Nonexclusivity.  Nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent or limit Employee's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other
plans, programs, policies or practices provided by the
Company and for which Employee may otherwise qualify, nor
shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights
as any Employee may have under any stock option or other
agreements with the Company.  Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, amounts which are vested benefits or which
Employee is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan,
policy, practice or program of the Company at or subsequent
to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance
with such plan, policy, practice or program.

   5.  Successor to Company.  The Company shall require any
successor or assignee, whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or
substantially all the business or assets of the Company,
expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform
the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Company would be
required to perform if no such succession or assignment had
taken place.  In such event, the term "Company," as used in
this Agreement, shall mean the Company as hereinafter
defined and any successor or assignee to the business or
assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

   6.  Certain Reduction of Payments.

     (a)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that
any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
benefit of Employee (whether paid or payable or distributed
or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise) (a "Payment") would be nondeductible by the
Company for Federal income tax purposes because of Section
280G of the Code, then the aggregate present value of
amounts payable or distributable as severance benefits
hereunder shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount.  The
"Reduced Amount" shall be an amount expressed in present
value which maximizes the aggregate present value of such
severance benefits without causing any Payment to be
nondeductible by the Company because of Section 280G of the
Code.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, if the
Reduced Amount is zero and it is determined further that any
Payment which is not part of the severance benefits payable
hereunder would nevertheless be nondeductible by the Company
for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of
the Code, then the aggregate present value of Payments which
are not severance benefits under this Agreement shall also
be reduced (but not below zero) to an amount expressed in
present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of
Payments without causing any payment to be nondeductible by
the Company because of Section 280G of the Code.  For
purposes of this paragraph 6, present value shall be
determined in accordance with Section 280G(d) (4) of the
Code.

     (b)  All determinations required to be made under this
paragraph 6 shall be made by the Company's independent
auditors which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Company and Employee within 15
business days of the Date of Termination or such earlier
time as is requested by the Company and an opinion to
Employee that he or she has substantial authority not to
report any excise tax on his Federal income tax return with
respect to any Payments.  Any such determination by the
Company's independent auditors shall be binding upon the
Company and Employee.  Employee shall determine which and
how much of the Payments, shall be eliminated or reduced
consistent with the requirements of this paragraph 6,
provided that, if Employee does not make such determination
within ten business days of the receipt of the calculations
made by the Company's independent auditors, the Company
shall elect which and how much of the Payments shall be
eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of
this paragraph 6 and shall notify Employee promptly of such
election.  Within five business days thereafter, the Company
shall pay to or distribute to or for the benefit of Employee
such amounts as are then due to Employee under this
Agreement.

     (c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the application
of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Company's independent auditors
hereunder, it is possible that Payments will have been made
by the Company which should not have been made
("Overpayment") or that severance benefits payable hereunder
will not have been made by the Company which could have been
made ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the
calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event
that the Company's independent auditors, based upon the
assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service
against Employee or the Company which the Company's
independent auditors believe has a high probability of
success, determine that an Overpayment has been made, any
such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or
for the benefit of Employee shall be treated for all
purposes as a loan ab initio to Employee which Employee
shall repay to the Company together with interest at the
applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2)
of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be
deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable to
the Company if and to the extent such deemed loan and
payment would not either reduce the amount on which Employee
is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the
Code or generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that
the Company's independent auditors, based upon controlling
precedent or other substantial authority, determine that an
Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be
promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of
Employee together with interest at the applicable federal
rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code.

   7.  Amendments and Termination.  The Incumbent Board may
from time to time supplement, amend or terminate this
Agreement or make any other provisions which the Company may
deem necessary or desirable, without the approval of
Employee; provided, however, that from and after such time
there has been a Change of Control, this Agreement shall not
be amended in any manner which would adversely affect the
interests of Employee without the written consent of
Employee.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
establishes and vests in Employee a contractual right to the
benefits to which Employee is entitled hereunder,
enforceable by Employee against the Company.  The form of
any proper amendment or termination of this Agreement shall
be a written instrument signed by a duly authorized officer
or officers of the Company certifying that the amendment or
termination has been approved by the Incumbent Board.

   8.  Miscellaneous.

     8.1  Employment Status.  This Agreement does not
constitute a contract of employment or impose on Employee or
the Company any obligation to retain Employee as an
employee, to change the status of Employee's employment, or
to change the Company's policies regarding termination of
employment.

     8.2  No Assignment.  No benefit hereunder shall be
subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt
to do so shall be void.

     8.3  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed
by the laws of the State of California.

     8.4  Expenses of Suit.  In the event of any dispute or
litigation between the Company and the Employee arising out
of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the enforcement of its rights hereunder.

     8.5  Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

     8.6  Descriptive Headings.  Descriptive headings of the
several paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning
or construction of any of the provisions hereof.

     Please acknowledge your agreement to the foregoing
agreement by signing the enclosed counterpart of this letter
and returning it to the Company.

Very truly yours,

APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS, INC.

December 3, 1992



Dear Andre Marion:

     Pursuant to a letter dated November 1, 1990 (the
"Severance Benefit Letter") between you ("Employee") and
Applied Biosystems, Inc., a California corporation (the
"Company"), the Company has agreed to provide you with
certain benefits in the event that your employment is
terminated for specified reasons within two years after a
Change of Control.  We now wish to make certain amendments
to that letter.  Certain capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the
Severance Benefit Letter.

     Recitals.  The Company has entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 6, 1992, by and
among the Company, The Perkin-Elmer Corporation ("Perkin-
Elmer") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Perkin-Elmer (the
"Merger Agreement"), providing for a merger ("Merger")
following which the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Perkin-Elmer.  In consideration for and as an
inducement to Employee's agreement to the provisions of
Section 1(b), the Company is willing to agree to the
provisions of Section 1(a).

     1.   Amendments.

     a.  Paragraph 3.7 of the Severance Benefit Letter is
hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

          "Good Reason" means (i) reduction of Employee's
     base salary or rate of compensation as in effect
     immediately prior to the Change of Control, (ii)
     failure to continue to provide any medical, dental,
     accident or disability benefits that are no less
     favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided
     to Employee immediately prior to the Change of Control
     (except that employee contributions may be raised to
     the extent of any cost increases imposed by third
     parties), (iii) failure or refusal of the successor
     company to assume the Company's obligations under this
     Agreement, as required by paragraph 5, (iv) breach by
     the Company or any successor company of any of the
     provisions of this Agreement, or (v) change of
     Employee's principal place of employment to a location
     more than 50 miles from Employee's principal place of
     employment on the date hereof without the consent of
     Employee.

     b.  New paragraph 8 is added as follows:

          Conditions to Payment of Salary Continuation
     Benefits.  Payment of benefits pursuant to Sections 1.1
     and 1.2 shall be conditioned upon (i) Employee not,
     directly or indirectly, during the period in which
     Employee is receiving salary continuation benefits
     pursuant to Section 1.1, without the written consent of
     Perkin-Elmer, becoming a principal, partner,
     shareholder owning more than 5%, director, officer,
     employee, agent or consultant of a company or other
     business entity whose principal business is the
     development, manufacturing, marketing, sale or lease of
     instrument systems or associated consumable products,
     including reagents, for life science research, (ii)
     Employee not, during the period in which Employee is
     receiving salary continuation benefits pursuant to
     Section 1.1, without the written consent of Perkin-
     Elmer, becoming a principal, partner, shareholder
     owning more than 5%, director, officer, employee, agent
     or consultant in a part of a business not covered by
     clause (i) where Employee's primary work responsibility
     involves the development, manufacturing, marketing,
     sale or lease of instrument system or associated
     consumable products, including reagents, for life
     science research, and (iii) Employee not directly or
     indirectly interfering with an customer or supplier
     relationship of Perkin-Elmer's or the Company's, or
     solicit or assisting anyone to solicit in any way any
     employee of Perkin-Elmer or the Company to resign or
     sever employment, or to breach an employment contract
     with Perkin-Elmer or the Company.  In the event that
     Employee shall at any time during the period in which
     Employee is receiving salary continuation benefits
     pursuant to Section 1.1 fail to meet the condition to
     payment of benefits set forth in the preceding
     sentence, then the Company shall, effective as of the
     date on which Employee fails to meet such condition,
     have no further obligation to make any payments
     pursuant to Sections 1.1 or 1.2.

and the subsequent paragraph is renumbered accordingly.

     2.  Governing Law.  This letter shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws
principles or rules.

     3.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
shall constitute an original copy hereof, but all of which
together shall constitute one agreement.

     4.  Full Force and Effect.  Except to the extent
expressly provided in this letter, the terms and provisions
of the Severance Benefit Letter shall remain in full force
and effect.

     The undersigned duly authorized officer of the Company
hereby certifies that, the amendments to the Severance
Benefit Letter contained herein have been approved by the
Incumbent Board.

Physical Electronics Division (PHI) as of March 31, 1994. Both product
lines were sold for approximately net book value.
On February 18, 1993, the shareholders of PE and Applied Biosystems,
Inc. (ABI) approved the merger of PE and ABI. The transaction was
accounted for as a pooling of interests (see Note 2).
On July 29, 1993, the Company announced its plans to divest its
Material Sciences business segment. Consequently, the Material
Sciences segment is presented in the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements as a discontinued operation (see Note 2).
Effective June 30, 1993, the Company changed its fiscal year end from
July 31 to June 30. Prior to fiscal 1993, the financial statements of
ABI and PE's subsidiaries outside the United States were for fiscal
years ended June 30, while PE's domestic operations reported on a July
31 year end. Fiscal 1993, therefore, includes PE's domestic operations
for eleven months compared with a full year for fiscal years 1994 and
1992.
Results of Continuing Operations
Consolidated net revenues were $1,024.5 million in fiscal 1994,
up $13.2 million from $1,011.3 million in fiscal 1993. The Company
sold ASO during the first quarter of fiscal 1994 and PHI as of the end
of the third quarter. The effect of selling these two business units
decreased net revenues by $37 million compared with the prior year.
Currency effects, primarily from the stronger U.S. dollar compared to
the major European currencies, decreased net revenues approximately
$25 million in the current year when compared with fiscal 1993. Strong
worldwide demand for life science products, especially Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) - related instruments and consumables and DNA
sequencers, increased revenues $53.5 million (including the
unfavorable effects of currency) in fiscal 1994 and offset slower
demand experienced in traditional analytical instrument product lines.
As previously mentioned, fiscal 1993's net revenues for domestic
operations included only eleven months of results because of the
change in the Company's fiscal year end. Management estimates that
this decreased net revenues by approximately $35 million.
Fiscal 1993 consolidated net revenues of $1,011.3 million were up 4.3%
from $970.1 million in fiscal 1992. The increase of $41.2 million in
fiscal 1993 was attributed to strong worldwide demand for the
Company's life science products, especially DNA sequencers, PCR-
related instruments and consumables, and liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry instrument systems. The effects from foreign currency
translation added approximately $5 million to net revenues for fiscal
1993.
Net revenues by geographic area
(Dollar amounts in millions)      1994     1993      1992
United States                $   417.8  $  404.5   $ 412.2
Europe                           362.6     420.4     395.2
Far East                         195.3     144.5     120.1
Other Countries                   48.8      41.9      42.6
                             $ 1,024.5  $1,011.3    $970.1
The previously mentioned change in year end and the loss of ASO and
PHI revenues approximately offset each other in the U.S. on a year-to-
year comparison of fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1993. The U.S., Far East and
Latin American markets improved during fiscal 1994 as demand for life
science products increased. Net revenues in the Far East increased 35%
from year to year showing improvement in both traditional analytical
instrument products (organic and inorganic product lines) and life
science products. This is indicative of the emerging markets in this
region. In the Far East, the Company used selective pricing strategies
throughout the year in analytical instrument product lines to generate
higher unit sales volumes in the current fiscal year. Latin America
showed a 17% increase year to year as sales were strong in all
analytical instrument product lines. In Europe, the continued
recessionary environment and strong competition resulted in sales at a
lower level than the prior year.
During fiscal 1993, net revenues in the United States decreased $7.7
million primarily because of the change in fiscal year end, offset
somewhat by increased sales in life science products. European sales
were higher in fiscal 1993, increasing 6.4% over fiscal 1992, as a
result of higher unit prices. Instrument sales in the Far East were
strong during fiscal 1993 as a result of increased demand for large
scale DNA products and increased sales of thermal analysis and atomic
absorption instrument systems. Net revenues in the Far East benefited
from the establishment of several direct sales offices in emerging
markets.

Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was
48% in fiscal 1994 compared with 47% in fiscal 1993 and 46% in fiscal
1992. Gross margins are traditionally lower in the U.S. than overseas
due to keen domestic competition and favorable pricing in Europe for
specific product offerings. The improvement in gross margin in fiscal
1994 resulted from a more favorable product mix worldwide. The more
favorable product mix was caused by sales of higher margin life
science products in the U.S. and the Far East and the decrease in
sales of lower margin products resulting from the divestitures of ASO
and PHI. The increase in life science revenues in the Far East,
yielding improved gross margins, helped offset lower margins resulting
from the poor economic conditions in Europe and the aforementioned
pricing strategies used in the Far East for analytical instruments.
The increase from fiscal 1992 to 1993 was primarily attributed to
higher sales volumes of life science products.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses
(SG&A) decreased $8.8 million or 3% in fiscal 1994. Favorable
currency effects during fiscal 1994 accounted for approximately $7
million of the decrease. Higher marketing expenses of approximately $6
million in the Far East, primarily related to the life science
business, were offset by reduced marketing expenses of approximately
$8 million in Europe during fiscal 1994. Also, fiscal 1993 included a
$3 million one-time charge to reduce the value of certain receivables
due from customers in Eastern Bloc countries.
The increase in fiscal 1993 of $22.2 million was attributed to the
aforementioned writedown of receivables, higher marketing expenses
resulting from the establishment of direct sales offices in the Far
East, expansion of marketing activities in the Company's life science
markets and currency effects from the weaker U.S. dollar during the
first half of the year.
Consolidated research, development and engineering expenses
(R&D) were $94.2 million in fiscal 1994, an increase of 12% over
the prior year, and $83.8 million in fiscal 1993, an increase of 3%
over fiscal 1992. The Company has increased its investment in R&D,
primarily in life science programs, which accounts for the higher
spending in fiscal 1994.
In fiscal 1993, the increase of $2.5 million was the result of higher
spending on R&D efforts in the biotechnology field.
Other. In connection with the ABI merger, the Company
recorded one-time charges in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 of $12.5
million for transaction costs and $28.5 million to combine operations
of the two companies. The transaction costs included expenses for
investment banker and professional fees. The costs to combine
operations included provisions for streamlining marketing and
distribution arrangements, consolidation of field sales and service
offices worldwide, relocation of certain product lines and key
personnel and severance-related costs. During fiscal 1994,
approximately $17 million in costs was incurred. The balance primarily
represents severance and facilities-related costs which are expected
to be paid over the next two fiscal years. Accordingly, the impact on
working capital in future years is expected to be minimal.
In fiscal 1992, the Company and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. formed a
strategic alliance to market and develop PCR technology used in the
amplification of DNA. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
sold its 51% interest in the Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments joint
venture. The transaction resulted in a one-time before-tax gain of
$3.3 million (see Note 2 for further discussion).
Based upon a strategic assessment of its markets, in fiscal 1992 ABI
recorded a $22 million charge to write down goodwill and other
intangibles and to provide for costs of closing a small European
operation and a manufacturing facility in San Jose, California. This
restructuring was substantially completed in fiscal 1993 (see Note
10).
Consolidated operating income for fiscal 1994 was $96.0 million
compared to $43.5 million in fiscal 1993 and $62.6 million in fiscal
1992. Operating income was affected in fiscal 1993 and 1992 by the
aforementioned merger and restructuring costs.
Consolidated interest expense was $7.1 million in fiscal 1994
compared with $13.1 million in fiscal 1993 and $19.9 million in fiscal
1992. The decrease of $6 million in fiscal 1994 was primarily the
result of reduced borrowing levels and lower interest rates. The
decrease of $6.8 million in fiscal 1993 was a result of lower interest
rates, lower average commercial paper borrowings, repayment of long-
term debt and the reclassification of interest expense on tax claims
to income tax expense. This reclassification was made in connection
with the adoption of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
Consolidated interest income was $2.4 million in fiscal 1994
compared with $7.5 million in fiscal 1993 and $10.1 million in fiscal
1992. During fiscal 1993, the Company owned a 7% promissory note from
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. which was sold in June 1993. The sale of
this note accounted for most of the decrease in interest income in
fiscal 1994. In addition, two sub-

                                 -22-
<PAGE>
ordinated long-term notes receivable totaling $3.7 million were repaid
in connection with the sale of the Company's minority equity investment
in MRJ Inc. during the second quarter of this year (see Note 2).
The lower interest income in fiscal 1993, when compared with the prior
year, was the result of a reduction in long-term notes receivable.
During fiscal 1992, higher interest income resulted from accrued
interest on the note received as partial consideration for the sale of
an equity investment (see Note 2).
Consolidated other income (expense), net was expense of $2.1
million in fiscal 1994 compared with income of $6.1 million in fiscal
1993 and expense of $3.5 million in fiscal 1992. In fiscal 1993, other
income included the gain of $8.5 million from the sale of a promissory
note from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., and higher joint venture income
which was partially offset by a $5 million charge to reduce the
carrying value of certain unoccupied properties. Fiscal 1994 included
higher miscellaneous nonoperating expenses than fiscal 1993. The
increased other income in fiscal 1993 over the prior year was the
result of the aforementioned events in fiscal 1993, as well as lower
net realized exchange losses.
The consolidated effective income tax rate was 17% for fiscal
1994 compared with 44% for fiscal 1993 and 51% in fiscal 1992. The
prior year's results included one-time charges of $41.0 million
related to the merger with ABI, which were not fully deductible for
tax purposes, resulting in a higher tax rate. During the first quarter
of fiscal 1994, the Company received a favorable ruling from the U.S.
Tax Court upholding the Company's pricing method on intercompany sales
with respect to its operations in Puerto Rico. Resolution of this long-
standing dispute with the U.S. government and the additional tax
benefits realized from the inclusion of ABI results for a full year
also reduced the Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 1994 when
compared with the prior year. Together with other information about
the income tax provision, an analysis of the differences between the
U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective rate can be found in
Note 4.
Discontinued Operations (see Note 2)
Loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 1994 includes the
after-tax settlement of $15.2 million related to the Hubble Space
Telescope mirror and the anticipated loss on disposal of the Company's
Material Sciences segment. During fiscal 1994, the Company entered
into an agreement with Sulzer Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Sulzer, Ltd., Winterthur, Switzerland, for the sale of the Material
Sciences segment. The completion of the sale is subject to closing
conditions, including obtaining relevant government regulatory
approvals. The transaction has taken longer to complete than expected
due primarily to obtaining necessary government approvals in both the
U.S. and Europe. As a result of this and negative operating factors,
the Company recorded an after-tax loss on disposal of $7.7 million
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations in fiscal 1993 and 1992
includes the results of the Company's Material Sciences segment and
Lynx Therapeutics, Inc., a discontinued operation of ABI.
Management believes that divesting its Material Sciences business will
allow the Company to concentrate on growth opportunities in its core
business of analytical instruments. This will allow the Company to
focus its financial and operational resources in one industry segment:
the development, manufacture, marketing, sales and service of
analytical instrument systems. As disclosed in Note 2, Material
Sciences profits declined from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994. This was
primarily related to the weakness and extended downturn in the
aircraft turbine engine market and significant downsizing that has
occurred in the airline industry in recent years. In addition, in
fiscal 1994, operations were adversely affected by the pro-
tracted negotiations with the potential buyer and regulatory
authorities.
Changes in Accounting Principles. In fiscal 1993, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
and No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." SFAS
Nos. 106 and 112 require the accrual method of accounting for the
related costs (see Note 5). SFAS No. 109 supersedes SFAS No. 96 and,
among other things, changes the criteria for recognition and
measurement of deferred tax assets (see Note 4).
As a result of adopting the new accounting standards as of August 1,
1992, a one-time, after-tax charge of $83.1 million was recorded. This
represented the cumulative effect of the changes on fiscal years prior
to 1993.

Foreign Currency. It is the Company's policy to reduce sub-
stantially the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates associated with future cash flows through its exposure
management and foreign currency hedging activities. The Company enters
into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option
contracts to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency rates
associated with certain assets and obligations denominated in foreign
currencies. The foreign exchange options permit but do not require the
Company to exchange foreign currencies at a future date with another
party at a contracted exchange rate. The foreign exchange contracts
are accounted for as hedges of net investments, firm commitments, and
foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses on hedges of net
investments are reported as equity adjustments from translation on the
balance sheet. The gains and losses on hedges of firm commitments are
deferred and included in the basis of the transaction underlying the
commitment. Gains and losses on transaction hedges are recognized in
income and offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related
transaction. Management believes any reasonably likely change in the
level of underlying major currencies being hedged will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial statements.
Management's Discussion of Financial Resources and Liquidity
This discussion of financial resources and liquidity focuses on the
Statements of Financial Position (page 27) and the Statements of Cash
Flows (page 28).
Statements of Financial Position
bullet Cash and short-term investments are primarily cash, cash equivalents,
time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturity dates
of three months to one year (short-term investments). Cash and short-
term investments were $25.0 million at June 30, 1994 and $30.3 million
at June 30, 1993.
bullet PE's current accounts receivable of $231.6 million at June 30, 1994
increased by $13.3 million over June 30, 1993. An estimated $8.5
million was due to the effects of currency translation. The balance at
June 30, 1993 included $12.4 million of accounts receivable with
respect to the operations of PHI and ASO which were sold during fiscal
1994. Increased fourth quarter sales of analytical instruments in
fiscal 1994 accounted for the remaining increase year to year.
bullet Inventories were $201.4 million at June 30, 1994 compared with $179.1
million a year ago. The effects of currency translation accounted for
approximately $7 million of the increase. The balance at June 30, 1993
included $12.8 million of inventory with respect to the divested
operations of PHI and ASO. Orders for analytical instruments in the
fourth quarter of this year outpaced sales in every geographic region.
The primary reason for the higher inventories was an increase in
manufacturing to support the higher backlog at June 30, 1994.
bullet Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $56.7 million
at June 30, 1994 from $47.3 million a year ago. The increase in
prepaid expenses and other current assets of $9.4 million was
primarily because of increased taxes receivable and royalties
receivable.
bullet Net property, plant and equipment (PP&E) was $149.1 million at June
30, 1994 compared with $162.7 million a year ago. PP&E consists
primarily of investments for productive use. The net decrease of $13.6
million primarily resulted from the sales of PP&E of $14.4 million for
ASO and PHI and reclassifications of assets held for sale, which were
partially offset by capital spending during fiscal 1994.
bullet Total other long-term assets increased from $152.7 million at June
30, 1993 to $164.5 million at June 30, 1994. Other long-term assets
primarily consist of marketable securities maturing beyond one year,
goodwill, investments in affiliated companies, deferred tax assets and
other long-term assets. The primary reason for the increase in long-
term assets was higher assets held for sale and a note receivable for
$7.2 million received as partial consideration for the sale of PHI.
bullet Accounts payable increased approximately $7 million at
June 30, 1994 compared with the prior year. This resulted from higher
purchases to support production as previously discussed.
bullet Other accrued expenses decreased approximately $11 million. The
decrease resulted primarily from funding merger-related costs of $17
million and the reclassification of pension liabilities from current
to long-term. This was partially offset by an increase in deferred
service revenues. The reclassification of pension liabilities was the
result of anticipated funding requirements in the U.S. for fiscal
1995.
bullet Total borrowings on a consolidated basis aggregated $117.8 million at
June 30, 1994 compared with $81.1 million at the end of fiscal 1993.
The Company's debt to total capitalization was 29% at June 30, 1994
compared with 21% at June 30, 1993. The increase in total borrowings
of $36.7 million in fiscal 1994 was primarily the result of PE's
funding of merger-related costs, settlement of potential claims
related to the Hubble Space Telescope mirror and the Company's stock
repurchase program. In accordance with existing Board authorizations,
the Company purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of PE common
stock during fiscal 1994.

                              -24-
<PAGE>

bullet Other long-term liabilities were $181.5 million at June 30, 1994
compared with $163.4 million at the end of fiscal 1993. The increase
was primarily the result of higher pension and postretirement benefit
liabilities.
PE has consistently maintained a strong financial position and
conservative capital structure. Management believes that the Company's
financial resources and liquidity remain strong and adequate to meet
ongoing operational and financial commitments.
Statements of Cash Flows
The Statements of Cash Flows depict cash flows by three broad
categories: operating activities, investing activities and financing
activities.
Operating activities are the principal source of PE's cash flows.
Investments in property, plant and equipment represent the Company's
ongoing investing activity. Major ongoing financing activities include
payment of dividends to shareholders and transactions surrounding the
Company's various stock plans. PE's capital expenditures for fiscal
1994 approximated $34 million compared with $28 million for fiscal
1993 and $31 million for fiscal 1992.
PE's cash and cash equivalents aggregated $25 million at June 30, 1994
compared with $28.6 million at the end of fiscal 1993. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $37 million for the year ended
June 30, 1994 compared with $66.4 million at the end of fiscal 1993
and $71.5 million at the end of fiscal 1992. Fiscal 1994 included
approximately $15 million paid to settle potential claims related to
the Hubble Space Telescope mirror and $17 million to fund combination
costs related to the merger with ABI. The Company generated $32
million in additional borrowings, $31.9 million from the sale of
businesses and assets and $17.4 million from the exercise of Company
stock options. During the year, the Company invested approximately $34
million in capital expenditures, paid $30 million in dividends to
shareholders and repurchased approximately $60 million of PE's common
stock. Purchases of common stock were made to support the Company's
various stock plans and additional shares were repurchased under the
existing Board authorization. Capital spending commitments as of June
30, 1994 were not significant.
Outlook
Inflation and changing prices are continually monitored. The
Company attempts to minimize the impact of inflation by improving
productivity. When operating costs increase, the Company generally
recovers such costs by increasing, over time, the price of its
products and services. The Company believes that the effects of
inflation have been appropriately managed and therefore have not had a
material impact on its operations or financial position.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," is
required to be implemented no later than fiscal 1995. The Company
believes adoption of the standard, at this time, will not have a
material impact on its financial statements.
The global economic and political outlook for 1995 has uncer-
tainties. PE is subject to these economic uncertainties in key markets
around the world. However, management believes that the Company has
been strengthened by its merger with ABI and will benefit from its
decision to divest its Material Sciences business and concentrate on
growth opportunities for analytical instrument systems. Expectations
for the remainder of this calendar year are being impacted by the
protracted economic downturn in the European analytical instrument
markets and the uncertain climate for environmental and pharmaceutical
customers in the United States. In the longer term, the Company is
encouraged by the accelerating pace of biotechnology advances which it
hopes will translate into demand for its life science systems. The
Company is also optimistic about the gradual upturn of global
analytical instrument markets. Management believes that PE's global
businesses and strong financial condition combine to position the
Company to deal effectively with the uncertainties and to benefit from
any improvements in the economy in fiscal 1995.

Note 1   Accounting Policies and Practices
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of all majority-owned
subsidiaries of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (PE or the Company),
reflect the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI) as a
pooling of interests and present the Company's Material Sciences
segment as a discontinued operation (see Note 2). Effective June
30, 1993, the Company changed its fiscal year end from July 31 to
June 30. Prior to fiscal 1993, the financial statements of ABI
and PE's subsidiaries outside the United States were for fiscal
years ended June 30, while PE's domestic operations reported on a
July 31 fiscal year end. Fiscal 1993, therefore, includes PE's
domestic operations for eleven months. The fiscal 1993
Consolidated Statement of Operations has been reclassified to
reflect a $3.0 million charge to reduce the value of receivables
due from Eastern Bloc countries, previously included as other
expense, as an operating expense.
Investments. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for
its investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures. Investments
in which PE's ownership is less than 20% are carried at cost.
The Company is required to implement SFAS No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," no later
than fiscal year 1995. This statement requires investments in
equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and
all investments in debt securities to be classified in three
categories: (1) held-to-maturity securities, which are reported
at amortized cost; (2) trading securities, which are reported at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings;
and (3) available-for-sale securities, which are reported at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and
reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The
Company believes adoption of the standard, at this time, will not
have a material impact on its financial statements.
Changes in Accounting Principles. During fiscal 1993, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" and No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." SFAS Nos. 106 and 112 require the accrual method of
accounting for the related costs (see Note 5). SFAS No. 109
supersedes SFAS No. 96 and, among other things, changes the
criteria for recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets
(see Note 4).
As a result of adopting the new accounting standards as of August
1, 1992, a one-time, after-tax charge of $83.1 million was
recorded in fiscal 1993. This represented the cumulative effect
of the changes on fiscal years prior to 1993.
Cash, Short-Term Investments and Marketable Securities. Cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments, time
deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities of
three months or less. Time deposits and certificates of deposit
with original maturities of three months to one year are
classified as short-term investments. Short-term investments and
marketable securities are valued at cost which approximates
market. Long-term marketable securities were $7 million at June
30, 1994 and 1993, and are included in other long-term assets
(see Note 13).
Foreign Currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations,
where the functional currency is the local currency, are
translated into U.S. dollars at the fiscal year end exchange
rate. The related translation adjustments are recorded as
cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated using
average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses, as well as translation
adjustments for assets and liabilities of foreign operations
where the functional currency is the dollar, are included in net
income (loss). Foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and
losses for the years presented were not material.
It is the Company's policy to reduce substantially the effects of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with
future cash flows through its exposure management and foreign
currency hedging activities. The Company enters into foreign
exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts
to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency rates associated
with certain assets and obligations denominated in foreign
currencies. The foreign exchange options permit but do not
require the Company to exchange foreign currencies at a future
date with another party at a contracted exchange rate. The
foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as hedges of net
investments, firm commitments, and foreign currency transactions.
Gains and losses on hedges of net investments are reported as
equity adjustments from translation on the balance sheet. The
gains and losses on hedges of firm commitments are deferred and
included in the basis of the transaction underlying the
commitment. Gains and losses on transaction hedges are recognized
in income (loss) and offset the foreign exchange gains and losses
on the related transaction.
The forward contracts and options contain an element of risk that
the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. However, the Company minimizes such risk exposure for
forward contracts and options by limiting the counterparties to
major international banks and financial institutions. Management
does not expect to record any losses as a result of counterparty
default. The Company does not require or place collateral for
these financial instruments.

Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a
first-in, first-out basis) or market. Inventories at June 30,
1994 and 1993 included the following components:
(Dollar amounts in millions)   1994     1993
Raw materials and supplies   $ 24.9   $ 27.9
Work-in-process                22.4     25.4
Finished products             154.1    125.8
Total                        $201.4   $179.1
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation. Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost and at June 30, 1994 and 1993
consisted of the following:
(Dollar amounts in millions)             1994      1993
Land                                   $ 20.8    $ 27.9
Buildings and leasehold improvements    124.6     131.2
Machinery and equipment                 183.7     193.7
Property, plant and equipment, at cost  329.1     352.8
Accumulated depreciation and
  amortization                          180.0     190.1
Property, plant and equipment, net     $149.1    $162.7
Major renewals and improvements that significantly add to
productive capacity or extend the life of an asset are
capitalized. Repairs, maintenance and minor renewals and
improvements are expensed when incurred.
Provisions for depreciation of owned property, plant and
equipment are based upon the expected useful lives of the assets
and computed primarily by the straight-line method. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the term of the applicable lease, whichever is less, using the
straight-line method. Fixed assets leased under capital leases
were not material for the years presented.
Intangible Assets. The excess of purchase price over the net
asset value of companies acquired is amortized on a straight-line
method over periods not exceeding 40 years. Patents and
trademarks are amortized using the straight-line method over
their expected useful lives. The accumulated amortization of
intangibles at June 30, 1994 and 1993 was $22.5 million and $17.6
million, respectively.
Amortization of Software Development Costs. Capitalized software
development costs are amortized based upon the greater of the
straight-line method over the estimated economic life or the
ratio of current gross revenues to total expected gross revenues
for the product. The amounts recorded in the financial statements
are not material.
Income Taxes. PE intends to permanently reinvest substantially
all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. In
those instances where the Company expects to remit earnings, the
effect on the results of operations, after considering available
tax credits and amounts previously accrued, would not be
significant.
Revenues. PE recognizes revenues when products are shipped or
services are rendered. Amounts billed for service contracts are
credited to deferred service contract income and reflected in net
revenues over the term of the contract. The balance of deferred
service contract income included in other accrued expenses at
June 30, 1994 and 1993 was $37.3 million and $30.7 million,
respectively.
Research, Development and Engineering. Research, development and
engineering expenditures are expensed when incurred.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share. Net income (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents
outstanding. Common stock equivalents include stock options. The
difference between weighted average shares for primary and fully
diluted net income (loss) per share was not significant for the
years presented.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information. SFAS No. 95, "Statement of
Cash Flows," requires disclosure of noncash investing and
financing activities excluded from the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows and amounts paid in cash for interest and income
taxes.
The following is a statement of supplemental cash flow
information for fiscal years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992:
(Dollar amounts in millions)    1994    1993    1992
Interest                       $ 7.0   $12.5   $14.4
Income taxes                   $16.1   $18.5   $13.7
Noncash investing and
financing activities:
Note receivable from sale of
 assets (see Note 2)           $ 7.2
Acquisition of preferred stock
 for common stock and a note
 receivable (see Note 2)                       $17.0
Acquisition of note receivable
 for Payment-in-Kind
 preferred stock (see Note 2)                  $ 5.8
Acquisition of purchased tech-
 nology payable in future
 periods                                       $ 3.2
Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. stock

Other. During fiscal 1993, because of the continued softness in
the commercial real estate market, the Company reduced the
carrying value of certain unoccupied properties by $5 million.
This charge is included in other income (expense), net in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Note 2   Mergers and Divestitures
Merger with Applied Biosystems, Inc. On February 18, 1993, the
shareholders of PE and ABI approved the merger of PE and ABI.
Under the terms of the agreement, ABI shareholders received .678
of a share of the Company's common stock for each ABI share.
Accordingly, the Company issued 10.2 million shares of its common
stock for all the outstanding shares of ABI common stock.
Additionally, outstanding options to acquire ABI common stock
were converted to options to acquire 1.5 million shares of the
Company's common stock. ABI, founded in 1981, is a leading
supplier of automated systems for life science research and
related applications. ABI develops, manufactures and markets
systems, instruments and associated chemicals used to purify,
analyze, interpret results and synthesize biological molecules
such as DNA, RNA and proteins.
The merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization and was
accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the
Company's financial statements include the results of ABI for all
periods presented.
Combined and separate results of PE and ABI during the periods
preceding the merger were as follows (in millions):
Six months ended
January 31, 1993
(unaudited)           PE      ABI    Adjustment   Combined
Net revenues       $420.2   $100.9                 $521.1
Net income (loss)  $(54.5)  $  5.7                 $(48.8)

Fiscal year ended
July 31, 1992
Net revenues       $788.3   $181.8                 $970.1
Net income (loss)  $ 58.8   $(15.9)    $(7.7)      $ 35.2

The combined financial results presented above include
adjustments made to conform accounting policies of PE and ABI.
The only adjustment impacting net income was the restatement of
ABI's provision for income taxes from the accounting methods
prescribed by SFAS No. 109, to the methods prescribed by SFAS No.
96, which was used by PE prior to fiscal 1993. All other
adjustments were reclassifications to conform financial statement
presentation. Intercompany transactions between the two companies
for the periods presented were not material.
In connection with the merger, the Company recorded one-time
charges in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 for transaction costs
($12.5 million) and to reflect the costs to combine operations of
the two companies ($28.5 million). The transaction costs include
expenses for investment banker and professional fees. The costs
to combine operations include provisions for streamlining
marketing and distribution arrangements, consolidation of field
sales and service offices worldwide, relocation of certain
product lines and key personnel, and severance-related costs.
Amounts included in other accrued expenses related to costs to
combine operations at June 30, 1994 and 1993, were $9.6 million
and $26.4 million, respectively.
Discontinued Operations
Legal Settlement. During the first quarter of fiscal 1994, the
Company paid $15.5 million to settle potential claims related to
the Hubble Space Telescope mirror. This amount, which included
legal costs, resulted in an after-tax charge of $15.2 million and
is recorded in discontinued operations. In 1989, the Company had
sold the unit which performed the work on the telescope to a
subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft Company.
Material Sciences Segment. On July 29, 1993, the Company
announced its plans to divest its Material Sciences segment which
consists of the Company's Metco division (Metco) headquartered in
Westbury, New York. Metco produces combustion, electric arc and
plasma thermal spray equipment and supplies. The Company has
entered into an agreement with Sulzer Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Sulzer, Ltd., Winterthur, Switzerland, for the sale
of Metco. The completion of the sale is subject to closing
conditions, including receipt of relevant government regulatory
approvals. The transaction has taken longer to complete than
expected due primarily to obtaining necessary government
approvals in both the U.S. and Europe. As a result of this and
negative operating factors, the Company recorded an after-tax
loss on disposal of $7.7 million during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1994.
The net assets and operating results of Metco are presented in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a
discontinued operation.
Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. On October 5, 1992, prior to its merger
with PE, ABI announced the decision to distribute to its
shareholders approximately 82% of the stock of its subsidiary,
Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. (Lynx). The accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations reflect the Lynx operating results as a
discontinued operation. The net assets of Lynx were not
significant.

                             -32-

Summary results of the aforementioned discontinued operations
were as follows:

The net assets of Metco have been segregated in the June 30,
1994 and 1993 Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and
are summarized below:
(Dollar amounts in millions)          1994    1993
Assets:
Accounts receivable, net             $25.6   $27.1

Cumulative translation adjustments     4.7     2.9
Net Assets                           $56.2   $60.7
Divestitures. During the first quarter of fiscal 1994, the
Company sold the net assets of its Applied Science Operation to
Orbital Sciences Corporation. The Company received cash proceeds
of $600,000 and 320,000 shares of Orbital Sciences Corporation
common stock which were subsequently disposed of in the second
quarter of fiscal 1994 for proceeds of approximately $5 million.
During the second quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company sold its
minority equity investment in MRJ, Inc. to MRJ Group, Inc. for
$3.3 million in cash. In addition, two subordinated notes due
from MRJ, Inc. were repaid to the Company. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company completed the sale of its
Physical Electronics Division (PHI) to the management of PHI and
Chemical Venture Partners. The unit, which was sold for
approximately net book value, manufactures and markets surface
analysis equipment primarily used for thin-film characterization
by chemical analysis. The Company received cash proceeds of $23
million and a 10% interest-bearing note with a face value of $7.2
million in connection with the sale. The gains and losses from
the aforementioned divestitures were not significant to the
Company's results of operations.
Other. In June of fiscal 1992, PE acquired 10,000 shares of
Silicon Valley Group preferred stock in exchange for its minority
interest in SVG Lithography, Inc. (SVGL) (2 million shares of
SVGL common stock), and an SVGL note receivable maturing on May
1, 1995, representing an aggregate purchase price of $17 million.
The investment in preferred stock is included in other long-term
assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In
July of fiscal 1992, the Company sold to ETEC its senior Payment-
in-Kind preferred stock with a liquidation value of $6 million in
exchange for $250,000 in cash and a senior subordinated note
valued at approximately $5.8 million. The note is included in
other long-term assets.
Sale of Joint Venture. On December 11, 1991, PE and Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. formed a strategic alliance to market and develop the
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology used in the
amplification of DNA. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company sold its 51% interest in the noninstrument PCR assets  of
the Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments joint venture to Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. The agreement provides for PE to remain the exclusive
distributor of all PCR products in the nondiagnostic markets for
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. The Company received a 7% promissory note
from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., in the amount of $45 million and
royalty payments based on the net revenues of future sales for
PCR products. The transaction resulted in a one-time before-tax
gain of $3.3 million in fiscal 1992. In June of fiscal 1993, the
Company completed the sale of the 7% promissory note. This
transaction resulted in a one-time pretax gain of $8.5 million
included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations for fiscal 1993.

  fiscal 1997                         $28.4
 Yen denominated bank notes with
  maturities through fiscal 2005        5.7     $ 6.9

Total long-term debt                  $34.3     $ 7.1

The weighted average interest rates at June 30, 1994 and 1993 for
bank borrowings were 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively, and 4.5% and
3.2%, respectively, for commercial paper borrowings.
On June 1, 1994, the Company entered into a $150 million credit
facility consisting of a $50 million 364 day revolving credit
agreement and a $100 million three year revolving credit
agreement. The facility supports commercial paper issued by the
Company in the United States and working capital financing
requirements. Commitment and facility fees are based on leverage
and interest coverage ratios. Borrowings under the facility may
be either in the domestic or Eurodollar markets at the option of
the Company; interest rates on amounts borrowed vary depending on
the source. There were no borrowings under this facility at June
30, 1994 . This agreement replaced a similar facility which would
have expired on June 7, 1994.
On November 12, 1993, the Company's subsidiary, Perkin-Elmer
Italia S.p.A., exercised its option to extend 10 billion Lira of
the 15 billion Lira credit facility for an additional year.
Interest is payable at the Milan Interbank Offered Rate plus .75%
per annum. The loan agreement provides for a commitment fee of
.2%. At June 30, 1994, there were borrowings of approximately 3
billion Lira under the facility.
The Company's subsidiary, Perkin-Elmer Japan, entered into a
three year credit agreement under which it borrowed 2.8 billion
Yen at a fixed interest rate of 3.255%. The final maturity date
is scheduled for February 1997.
At June 30, 1994, PE had unused credit facilities for short-term
borrowings from domestic and foreign banks in various currencies
totaling approximately $321 million. Compensating balance
requirements and/or commitment fees for such credit arrangements
were not material.
Yen denominated bank notes include fixed rate notes (5.4% and
6.2% at June 30, 1994) and notes bearing interest at the bank's
long-term variable prime rates (3.5% and 4.4% at June 30, 1994).
Under various credit agreements, the Company is restricted as to
maintenance of minimum net worth and interest charge coverage
ratios.
Annual maturities of long-term debt for the fiscal years 1995
through 1999 are $1.9 million, $1.5 million, $29.3 million, $.7
million and $.4 million, respectively.
Note 4   Income Taxes
Effective August 1, 1992, PE adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns.
The cumulative effect of the change in the method of accounting
for income taxes attributable to fiscal years prior to 1993 was
to increase net income by $19.9 million. The tax benefit
primarily resulted from the recognition of deferred tax assets
relating to future tax amortization of foreign intangibles. The
impact of this change on fiscal 1993 operating results, after
recording the cumulative effect, was to recognize additional tax
expense of $2 million.
Income before income taxes for fiscal years ended 1994, 1993 and
1992 was as follows:
(Dollar amounts in millions)      1994    1993    1992
United States                    $65.0   $16.1   $14.2
Foreign                           24.1    27.8    35.1
Total                            $89.1   $43.9   $49.3

The components of the provision for income taxes for fiscal years
1994, 1993 and 1992 consisted of the following:
(Dollar amounts in millions)      1994     1993    1992
Currently payable:
 Federal                         $(1.3)   $ 2.4   $13.2

Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
at June 30, 1994 and 1993 were:

                                        Deferred Tax Assets

(Dollar amounts in millions)                1994     1993

Valuation allowance                       (119.6)  (136.0)
Total deferred tax asset                  $ 24.4   $ 25.7

                                   Deferred Tax Liabilities

(Dollar amounts in millions)                1994     1993
Inventories                               $ (1.0)  $  (.7)
Other reserves and accruals                 (6.6)    (5.1)
Total deferred tax liability                (7.6)    (5.8)
Total net deferred tax asset              $ 16.8   $ 19.9

For fiscal 1992, temporary differences giving rise to deferred
income taxes principally resulted from intangibles, reserves and
inventories.
A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax provision to the
Company's tax provision for the fiscal years ended 1994, 1993 and
1992 follows:
(Dollar amounts in millions)       1994    1993    1992
Federal statutory rate               35%     34%     34%

Total provision for
 income taxes                     $15.2   $19.5   $25.0

At June 30, 1994, PE has available foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $8.5 million which will expire between 1995 and
1999, and alternative minimum tax credits of $12.3 million with
an indefinite carryforward period.
The Company's federal tax returns have been examined by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 1975 through 1987,
and the IRS is currently examining 1988 and 1989. The primary
issue of significant dollar amount for the fiscal years 1975
through 1987 relates to the Company's pricing method on
intercompany sales with its subsidiary in Puerto Rico. In 1989,
the Company filed a petition in the United States Tax Court
contesting a Notice of Deficiency for taxable years 1975 through
1981 relating primarily to this matter. The Company has completed
trial before the Tax Court with respect to the deficiencies
relating to pricing and has received the Court's decision, which
essentially upheld the Company's pricing methods of the
intercompany sales. The favorable ruling from the Tax Court
contributed to a lower effective tax rate for the Company in
fiscal 1994. The other issue being considered by the Tax Court
has not yet been decided but is not material in nature. The years
1982 through 1987 are under consideration at the IRS appeals
level. It is the Company's opinion that it has adequately
provided in the financial statements for any potential IRS tax
adjustment relating to these years.
Note 5   Retirement and Other Benefits
Pension Plans. Substantially all employees worldwide are covered
by either PE or government sponsored retirement plans. The
Company recognizes pension expense in accordance with SFAS No.
87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions." Total pension expense
for its domestic plans and significant foreign plans was $17.3
million for fiscal 1994, $13.8 million for fiscal 1993 and $11.7
million for fiscal 1992.
The Company has a noncontributory pension plan (contributory
1984 and prior) covering substantially all of its domestic
employees (ABI employees were covered effective July 1, 1993).
Plan benefits are generally established based on average career
earnings. The Company also has nonqualified supplemental and
deferred compensation plans for certain officers and key
employees which are unfunded and paid directly by the Company.
The qualified pension plan in the United States is funded in
accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974. Plan assets are invested in various
securities including U.S. government and federal agency
obligations, corporate debt, preferred and common stocks, foreign
government obligations, real estate and foreign equities.
Employees outside of the U.S. generally receive retirement
benefits under various pension plans based upon such factors as
years of service and employee compensation levels which conform
to the practice common in the country in which PE conducts
business.

The following assumptions and components were used for the fiscal
years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992 to develop net periodic pension
cost:

The following table sets forth the funded status of the plans and
amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position at June 30, 1994 and 1993:

                                               Domestic Plans

Effect of items not yet recognized:
 Net actuarial loss                             (57.2)  (51.6)
 Prior service cost                              (4.7)   (9.3)
 Net transition asset                            13.7    16.0
Pension liability                              $ 29.5  $ 30.0

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, the Company
recorded, as shown in the table above, an additional minimum
liability at the end of each year representing the excess of the
accumulated benefit obligations over the fair value of plan
assets and accrued pension liabilities. The liabilities have been
offset by intangible assets to the extent possible. Because the
asset recognized may not exceed the amount of unrecognized prior
service cost, the balance of the liability is reported as a
reduction of shareholders' equity.
As a result of the Company's decision to sell its Applied Science
Operation, Physical Electronics Division and Material Sciences
segment (see Note 2), PE recognized a curtailment of its domestic
pension plan. The loss recognized was not material to the
financial statements.
The curtailment reduction of $2.8 million, reflected in the
Statement of Financial Position, was the gain from the reduction
in the projected benefit obligation. This is not recognized
immediately as a reduction of expense because it did not exceed
the amount of unrecognized cumulative loss, net of the
unrecognized initial asset, as required by SFAS No. 88.

PE has a profit sharing and savings plan whereby, when pretax
earnings per share of the common stock outstanding exceed $.3125
per share, the Company is required to fund the plan in an amount
equal to 8% of consolidated pretax earnings, as defined by the
plan, provided the amount of such payment does not reduce the
balance of such earnings below $.3125 per share of common stock.
The profit sharing payment by the Company is allocated among its
domestic employees (ABI employees were covered as of July 1,
1993) in direct proportion to their earnings. PE's contribution
was $7.5 million for fiscal 1994, $6.7 million for fiscal 1993
and $7 million for fiscal 1992.
Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits. PE provides
certain health care and life insurance benefits to domestic
employees, hired prior to January 1, 1993, who retire from the
Company and satisfy certain service and age requirements.
Generally, the medical coverage pays a stated percentage of most
medical expenses reduced for any deductible and payments made by
Medicare or other group coverage. Benefits are administered
through an insurance carrier paid by PE. The cost of providing
these benefits is shared with retirees. The cost sharing
provisions will vary depending on the retirement date, age and
years of service. The Company has amended the plan to exclude any
domestic employees hired after January 1, 1993. The plan is
unfunded.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," as of August 1,
1992. This statement requires the accrual of the cost of
providing postretirement benefits, including medical and life
insurance coverage, during the active service period of the
employee. The Company elected to immediately recognize the
accumulated liability, measured as of August 1, 1992. This
resulted in a one-time after-tax charge of $88.8 million or $1.98
per share. The effect of this change on fiscal 1993 operating
results, after recording the cumulative effect for fiscal years
prior to 1993, was to recognize additional after-tax expense of
$3.0 million or $.07 per share. The pro forma effect of the
change on fiscal years prior to 1993 was not determinable. Prior
to fiscal 1993, the Company recognized expense in the year the
benefits were paid. Postretirement health care and life insurance
costs charged to expense were $5.3 million in fiscal 1992.

The following table sets forth the funded status of the plan,
reconciled to the accrued postretirement benefit liability
recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position at June 30, 1994 and 1993:
(Dollar amounts in millions)               1994     1993
Actuarial present value of
 postretirement benefit obligation:
   Retirees                               $68.8    $72.1
 Fully eligible active participants         7.5      6.1
 Other active participants                 10.9     14.6
Accumulated postretirement benefit
 obligation (APBO)                         87.2     92.8
Effect of items not yet recognized:
 Unrecognized net gain                      6.6
Accrued postretirement benefit liability  $93.8    $92.8

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for fiscal 1994 and 1993
included the following components:
(Dollar amounts in millions)                 1994     1993
Service cost of benefits earned              $1.2     $1.2
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement
  benefit obligation                          7.2      6.7
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost     $8.4     $7.9

As a result of the Company's decision to sell its Applied Science
Operation, Physical Electronics Division and Material Sciences
segment (see Note 2), it recognized a $2.9 million gain related
to the curtailment of its postretirement benefit plan during
fiscal 1994.
The discount rate used in determining the APBO was 8.5% in fiscal
1994 and 1993. The assumed health care cost trend rate used for
measuring the APBO was divided into three categories:
                               1994   1993
Pre-65 participants            12.3%  13.0%
Post-65 participants            8.7%   9.0%
Medicare                        7.8%   8.0%

All three rates were assumed to decline to 5.5% over 11 years in
fiscal 1994 and over 12 years in fiscal 1993.
If the health care cost trend rate was increased 1 percent, the
APBO, as of June 30, 1994, would have increased 10.3%. The effect
of this change on the aggregate of service and interest cost for
fiscal 1994 would be an increase of 13%.
Foreign employees are primarily covered under government
sponsored programs and, therefore, the impact of SFAS No. 106 was
not material. No significant expense for foreign retiree medical
benefits was incurred by the Company in any of the years
presented.
Postemployment Benefits. The Company provides certain
postemployment benefits to eligible employees. These benefits
include severance, disability and medical-related costs paid
after employment but before retirement.
The Company adopted, effective as of the beginning of fiscal
1993, SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." SFAS No. 112 requires an accrual method of accounting
for the related costs. Prior to the adoption of this standard,
the Company recognized such costs at the time the benefits were
paid.
The adoption of SFAS No. 112 in fiscal 1993 resulted in a one-
time after-tax charge to net income of $14.2 million in the first
quarter of the year, representing the cumulative effect on prior
years of adopting the new standard.
Note 6   Geographic Area Information
PE operates in one industry segment: the development,
manufacture, marketing, sales and service of analytical
instrument systems. Included in this industry segment are
analytical instrument systems and associated consumable products
used to amplify, purify, analyze, interpret results of,
synthesize and sequence biological molecules such as DNA, RNA and
proteins utilized in life science and related applications.
This industry segment also includes analytical instrument systems
used for determining the composition and molecular structure of
chemical substances and measuring the concentration of materials
in a sample. Analytical instruments include spectrophotometers,
gas and liquid chromatographs, analytical balances, flame
photometers, polarimeters and data handling devices that are
designed for use with analytical instrument systems.
Operating income is net revenues less operating costs and
expenses. Operating costs and expenses include cost of sales,
selling, general and administrative and research, development and
engineering expenses. Identifiable assets include all assets
directly identified with those geographic areas. Corporate assets
consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, long-term marketable securities, certain

                            -38-
<PAGE>

other current and long-term assets and certain investments in
unconsolidated companies.
Information by geographic area is presented on a source basis,
with exports shown in their area of origin and R&D expenses
reflected in the area where the activity was performed. Operating
income reflects all profit in the region where the sale
originated. The geographic groupings of non-U.S. operations are
based on similarities of business environment and geographic
proximity.

(a) The financial data by geographic area for prior years has been
reclassified to reflect all operating profit in the region where the revenue
originated.
(b) The costs to combine operations of $28.5 million were included in
operating income of the United States ($15.4 million), Europe ($11.4
million), Far East ($1.4 million) and other countries ($.3 million). The $12.5
million in transaction costs is reflected as a corporate expense.


For purposes of this footnote, revenues between geographic areas
are accounted for at approximately cost.
Export sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and
July 31, 1992 were approximately $63.8 million, $76.1 million and
$80.7 million, respectively.
Note 7   Shareholders' Equity
Treasury Stock. PE's Board of Directors has authorized the
purchase of PE common stock to support the Company's employee
stock purchase plan and stock option plans. Under this Board of
Directors' resolution, purchases for this program are limited
annually to the number of shares expected to be issued under
these plans. For the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and July 31,
1992, the Company purchased .8 million shares, .4 million shares
and .5 million shares, respectively, to support these plans.
Under a separate program, PE is authorized to purchase common
stock when management deems such action to be in the best
interest of its shareholders and the Company. During fiscal 1989,
the Company's Board of Directors increased its authorization to
purchase PE common stock from 5 million shares to 10 million
shares. As of June 30, 1994, approximately 5 million shares
remain authorized to be purchased.
Shareholder Protection Rights Plan. PE has adopted a Shareholder
Protection Rights Plan designed to protect shareholders against
abusive takeover tactics by declaring a dividend of one right on
each outstanding share of common stock. Each right entitles
shareholders to buy one one-hundredth of a newly-issued share of
participating preferred stock having economic and voting terms
similar to those of one share of common stock at an exercise
price of $90.00, subject to adjustment.
The rights will be exercisable only if a person or a group: (a)
acquires 20% or more of the Company's shares or (b) commences a
tender offer that will result in such person or group owning 20%
or more of the Company's shares. Before that time, the rights
trade with the common stock, but thereafter they become
separately tradeable.
Upon exercise, after a person or a group acquires 20% or more of
the Company's shares, each right (other than rights held by the
acquiring person) will entitle the shareholder to purchase a
number of shares of preferred stock of the Company having a
market value of two times the exercise price. If PE is acquired
in a merger or other business combination, each right will
entitle the shareholder to purchase at the then exercise price a
number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having
a market value of two times such exercise price. If any person or
group acquires between 20% and 50% of PE's shares, the Company's
Board of Directors may, at its option, exchange one share of the
Company's common stock for each right.
The rights are redeemable at PE's option at one cent per right
prior to a person or group becoming an acquiring person.
Common Stock. In October 1993, the Company's shareholders
approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common
stock from 60 million to 90 million.
Note 8   Stock Plans
Stock Option Plans. Under PE's stock option plans, officers and
other key employees may be granted options, each of which allows
for the purchase of common stock at a price of not less than 100%
of fair market value at the date of grant.
As a result of the merger with ABI in 1993, all unexpired and
unexercised stock options under ABI's stock option plans were
converted to options to acquire .678 of a share of the Company's
common stock, and the obligations with respect to such options
have been assumed by PE. Each ABI option assumed by PE is subject
to the same terms and conditions which existed prior to the
merger.
Stock options granted under the ABI plans were available for
grant to employees, directors, consultants, sales representatives
and distributors. Incentive stock options, granted at prices not
less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of grant, and nonstatutory stock options, granted at prices
ranging from 85% to 100% of the fair market value on the date of
grant, were available for grant.
Transactions relating to the stock purchase and option plans of
the Company are summarized below. The table reflects the pooled
activity of PE and ABI options for 1992 and 1993 as if all ABI
options were granted, exercised, or canceled at .678 of a PE
share.

                              -40-
<PAGE>

As of June 30, 1994, 1.0 million shares remain available for
option grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
enables substantially all domestic employees to subscribe to
shares of common stock on an annual offering date at a purchase
price equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the day the right is granted or 85% of the fair
market value of the common stock on the day the 24 month purchase
period applicable to each right to purchase terminates.
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding right to
acquire ABI common stock pursuant to the ABI Employee Stock
Purchase Plan was converted to a right to purchase .678 of a
share of PE common stock subject to the same terms and conditions
set forth in the ABI purchase plan. ABI contributed 25% of the
purchase price of eligible stock purchases.
Common stock issued under the PE and ABI Employee Stock Purchase
Plans, assuming ABI stock was issued at .678 of a PE share prior
to the merger, was approximately .1 million in fiscal 1994, 1993
and 1992. At June 30, 1994, .8 million shares are reserved for
issuance.
Director Stock Purchase and Deferred Compensation Plan. In 1993,
PE adopted the Director Stock Purchase and Deferred Compensation
Plan which requires nonemployee directors of the Company to apply
at least 50% of their annual retainer to the purchase of common
stock. The purchase price of the common stock to be purchased
under the plan is the fair market value on the first calendar day
of the third month of each fiscal quarter. At June 30, 1994,
approximately 96,500 shares were available for issuance.
Restricted Stock. As part of PE's 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, a
total of 100,000 shares of common stock may be granted to key
employees pursuant to restricted stock awards. Such stock will
not vest until certain continuous employment restrictions are
met. PE's 1988 Stock Incentive Plan also permitted the grant of
restricted stock awards. In fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, there
were no shares awarded. The amounts charged to expense in fiscal
years 1993 and 1992 related to the 1988 plan were $.7 million and
$1 million, respectively. There were no charges in fiscal 1994.

or no continuing value; to reserve for the closing of its Swedish
operation; and to accrue for expenses related to the closure and
relocation of its San Jose, California manufacturing facility.
The closure of the Swedish operation and the San Jose facility
were substantially completed in fiscal 1993.

Rental expense was $32.9 million in fiscal 1994, $31.9 million in
fiscal 1993 and $27.7 million in fiscal 1992.
The Company has been named as a defendant in several legal
actions arising from the conduct of its normal business
activities. Although the amount of any liability that might arise
with respect to any of these matters cannot be accurately
predicted, the resulting liability, if any, will not in the
opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the
financial statements of the Company.
Note 12   Sale of Accounts Receivable
The Company periodically sells accounts receivable in Japan. In
1992, the Company also sold accounts receivable in Italy. These
transactions are recorded as sales in accordance with SFAS No.
77, "Reporting by Transferors for Transfers of Receivables with
Recourse," as amended. During the fiscal years ended 1994, 1993
and 1992, the Company received cash proceeds of $43.8 million,
$17.8 million and $38.1 million, respectively. The Company
believes that it has adequately provided for any risk of loss
which may occur under these arrangements.
Note 13   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of the following financial instruments held by the
Company:
Cash and Short-Term Investments. The carrying amount approximates
fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Marketable Securities Beyond One Year. The fair values of these
investments are estimated based on quoted market prices for those
or similar instruments.
Minority Equity Investments, Notes Receivable. The fair values
of these instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices
if available or quoted market prices of financial instruments
with similar characteristics.
Debt. The fair value of the Company's debt is estimated based on
the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same
remaining maturities.
Foreign Currency Contracts. The fair value of foreign currency

To the Shareholders of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation
The Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances
and include amounts based upon management's best estimates and
judgments. These accounting principles have been consistently
applied. The financial statements are believed to reflect, in all
material respects, the substance of events and transactions that
should be included. Financial information presented elsewhere in
this annual report is consistent with that in the financial
statements.
In meeting its responsibility for preparing reliable financial
statements, the Company depends on its system of internal
accounting controls. This system is designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions
are executed in accordance with the appropriate corporate
authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company believes that its accounting
controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or
irregularities that could be material to the financial statements
are prevented or would be detected within a timely period by
employees in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the
recognition that judgments are required to assess and balance the
costs and expected benefits of a system of internal accounting
controls. Written internal accounting control and other operating
policies and procedures supporting this system are communicated
throughout the Company. Adherence to these policies and
procedures is reviewed through a coordinated audit effort of the
Company's internal audit staff and independent accountants.
The independent accountants review and test the system of
internal accounting controls to the extent they consider
necessary to support their opinion on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Their report is the result of an
independent and objective review of management's discharge of its
responsibilities relating to the fairness of reported operating
results and financial condition.
The Company's Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed
solely of outside directors. The committee meets periodically
with the Company's independent accountants, management and
internal auditors to review matters relating to the quality of
financial reporting and internal accounting controls, the nature
and extent of internal and external audit plans and results, and
certain other matters. The independent accountants, whose
appointment is recommended by the Audit Committee to the Board of
Directors, have full and free access to this committee.
A statement of business ethics policy is communicated to all
Company employees. The Company monitors compliance with this
policy to help assure that operations are conducted in a
responsible and professional manner with a commitment to the
highest standard of business conduct.

Report of Independent Accountants
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
The Perkin-Elmer Corporation
In our opinion, based upon our audits and the
report of other auditors, the accompanying
consolidated statements of financial position
and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of shareholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of The
Perkin-Elmer Corporation and its subsidiaries
at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our
audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Applied Biosystems, Inc., which
statements reflect total revenues of
$181,805,000 for the year ended July 31,
1992. Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose report thereon has been
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed
herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for Applied Biosystems, Inc., is
based solely on the report of the other
auditors. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and
the report of other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.
As discussed in Note 4 and Note 5 to the
financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for income taxes,
postretirement benefits and postemployment
benefits in fiscal 1993.
