Item 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

      Lancaster Colony Corporation was reincorporated in Ohio effective January
2, 1992.  Prior to this date Lancaster Colony Corporation had been a Delaware
Corporation organized in 1961.  As used herein the term "registrant," unless
the context otherwise requires, refers to Lancaster Colony Corporation and its
subsidiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT BUSINESS SEGMENTS

      The registrant operates in three business segments - specialty foods,
automotive, and glassware and candles - which accounted for approximately 40%,
33% and 27%, respectively, of consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1994.  The financial information relating to business segments for the
three years ended June 30, 1994, appearing in Exhibit 13 in this Form 10-K
Annual Report, is incorporated by reference.  Further description of each 
business segment the registrant operates within is provided below.

                                SPECIALTY FOODS

      The food products manufactured and sold by the registrant include salad
dressings and sauces marketed under the brand names "Marzetti," "Pfeiffer" and
"Girard's"; frozen unbaked pies marketed under the brand names "Mountain Top"
and "Reames"; hearth-baked frozen breads marketed under the brand name "New
York Frozen Foods"; refrigerated chip and produce dips, dairy snacks and
desserts marketed under the brand names "Oak Lake Farms," "Allen" and/or
"Marzetti"; premium dry egg noodles marketed under the brand names "Inn Maid"
and "Amish Kitchen"; frozen specialty noodles, pastas, and breaded specialty
items marketed under the brand name "Reames" and caviar marketed under the
brand name "Romanoff."

      The salad dressings and sauces are manufactured in Columbus, Ohio;
Wilson, New York; Atlanta, Georgia and Milpitas, California.  The dressings are
sold in various metropolitan areas with sales being made both to retail and
foodservice markets.

      The frozen unbaked pies are marketed principally in the midwestern United
States through salesmen and food brokers to institutional distributors and
retail outlets.  A significant portion of the frozen bread sales is directed to
the foodservice market.

      The refrigerated chip and produce dips, dairy snacks and desserts are
sold through food brokers and distributors primarily in the midwestern and
southeastern parts of the United States.  The distribution of these products to
other parts of the country has significantly increased over the last three
years.

      The dry egg noodles are marketed by brokers principally in Ohio,
Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky.

      The "Reames" line is sold through brokers and distributors in various
metropolitan areas principally in the central and midwestern United States.

      This segment is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers,
the loss of any one or more of which would have a significant adverse effect on
operating results.  Although the Company is a leading producer of salad
dressings, all of the markets in which the registrant sells food products are
highly competitive in the areas of price, quality and customer service.


                                      2
<PAGE>   3





     During fiscal year 1994, the registrant obtained adequate supplies of raw
materials for this segment.

      The registrant's firm order backlog at June 30, 1994, in this business
segment, was approximately $3,089,000 as compared to a backlog of approximately
$2,749,000 as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.  It is expected that all
of these orders will be filled during the current fiscal year.  The operations
of this segment are not affected to any material extent by seasonal
fluctuations.  The registrant does not utilize any franchises or concessions in
this business segment.  The trade names under which it operates are significant
to the overall success of this segment.  However, the patents and licenses
under which it operates are not essential to the overall success of this
segment.

                                   AUTOMOTIVE

      The registrant manufactures and sells a complete line of rubber, vinyl
and carpeted car mats both in the aftermarket and to original equipment
manufacturers.  Other products are pickup truck bed mats, running boards, bed
liners and other accessories for pickup trucks and vans, truck and trailer
splash guards and quarter fenders, accessories such as tissue holders, litter
caddies and oil drain pans and new car components.  The automotive aftermarket
products are marketed primarily through mass merchandisers and automotive
outlets under the name "Rubber Queen" and the registrant sells bed liners under
the "Protecta" and "Line-A-Bed" trademarks, running boards under the "Dee Zee"
name, as well as under private labels.  Although minor, rubber matting sales
are also included in this segment.  The aggregate sales of two customers
accounted for approximately 32% of this segment's total net sales during 1994.
No other customer accounted for more than 10% of this segment's total net
sales.  Although the Company is a market leader in many of its product lines,
all the markets in which the registrant sells automotive products are highly
competitive in the areas of design, price, quality and customer service.

      During fiscal year 1994, the registrant obtained adequate supplies of raw
materials for this segment.

      The registrant's firm order backlog at June 30, 1994, in this business
segment, was approximately $12,503,000 as compared to a backlog of
approximately $7,257,000 as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.  It is
expected that all of these orders will be filled during the current fiscal
year.  The operations of this segment are not affected to any material extent
by seasonal fluctuations.  The registrant does not utilize any significant
franchises or concessions in this segment.  The patents, trademarks and
licenses under which it operates are generally not essential to the overall
success of this segment.

                             GLASSWARE AND CANDLES

      Glass products include a broad range of machine pressed and machine blown
consumer glassware and technical glass products such as cathode ray tubes,
lighting components, lenses and silvered reflectors.

      Consumer glassware includes a diverse line of decorative and ornamental
products such as tumblers, bowls, pitchers, jars and barware.  These products
are marketed under a variety of trademarks, the most important of which are
"Indiana Glass," "Tiara," "Colony" and "Fostoria." The registrant also
purchases domestic and imported blown glassware which is sold through Colony, a
marketing division, and some domestic handcrafted ware sold through its Tiara
home party marketing plan.

     Glass vases and containers are sold both in the retail and wholesale
florist markets under the trade name "Brody" as well as under private label.

      Candles of all sizes, forms and scents are sold in the mass merchandise
markets as well as to supermarkets, drug stores and specialty shops under

                                      3
<PAGE>   4


the name "Candle-lite."  Private label business is also an important part of
the candle market.

      The registrant's glass and candle products are sold to discount,
department, variety and drug stores, as well as to jobbers and directly to
retail customers.  Commercial markets such as foodservice, hotels, hospitals
and schools are also served by this segment's products.   All the markets in
which the registrant sells houseware products are highly competitive in the
areas of design, price, quality and customer service.  During 1994, sales of
glassware and candles to one customer accounted for approximately 12% of this
segment's total net sales.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of
this segment's total net sales.

      During fiscal year 1994, the registrant obtained adequate supplies of raw
materials for this business segment.

      The registrant's firm order backlog at June 30, 1994, in this business
segment, was approximately $24,229,000 as compared to approximately $23,142,000
as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.  It is expected that all of these
orders will be filled during the current fiscal year.  Seasonal retail stocking
patterns cause certain of this segment's products to experience increased sales
in the first half of the fiscal year. The registrant does not use any
franchises or concessions in this segment.  The patents and licenses under
which it operates are not essential to the overall success of this segment.
However, certain trademarks are important to this segment's marketing efforts.

NET SALES BY CLASS OF PRODUCTS

      The following table sets forth business segment information with respect
to the percentage of net sales contributed by each class of similar products
which accounted for at least 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales in any
fiscal year from 1992 through 1994.

GENERAL BUSINESS

                            RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

      The estimated amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on
research and development activities determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles is not considered material.

                             ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      Certain of the registrant's operations are subject to compliance with
various air emission standards promulgated under Title V of the Federal Clean
Air Act.  The effective date of compliance with such standards is scheduled to
occur in the registrant's fiscal year ending June 30, 1996.  The registrant is
currently developing a compliance strategy to submit to the related Federal
agency for approval.  Based upon available information, compliance with the
Federal Clean Air Act provisions, as well as other various Federal, state and
local environmental protection laws and regulations, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect upon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or the
competitive position of the registrant for the remainder of the current and
succeeding fiscal year.  See also Item 3 for a discussion of pending
environmental matters.

                                   EMPLOYEES

     The registrant has approximately 5,600 employees.

                      FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

      Financial information relating to foreign operations and export sales
have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in
the future based on existing operations.

Item 2.  PROPERTIES

      The registrant uses approximately 5,382,000 square feet of space for its
operations.  Of this space, approximately 1,560,000 square feet are leased.

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    On January 28, 1991, a cost recovery action under Section 107 of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")
was filed against Pretty Products, Inc. ("Pretty Products") and the registrant
in the United States District Court ("Court") for the Southern District of Ohio
in a proceeding styled UNITED STATES VS. PRETTY PRODUCTS, ET AL.  The complaint
seeks recovery of response costs allegedly incurred or to be incurred by the
EPA in connection with the cleanup of the Coshocton City Landfill. The
complaint also contains a claim for penalties under Section 104(e) of CERCLA
for an alleged failure to respond properly to certain information requests, but
this claim has been partially settled and the Court has indicated it is not
inclined to award penalties against the registrant or Pretty Products on the
record before it.  Pretty Products and the registrant are defending the
complaint on various grounds, among them the defense that the EPA's response
costs are overstated.  During fiscal 1994, the parties reached a tentative
settlement of all remaining claims totaling approximately $1,700,000, the full
amount of which has been provided for in the registrant's consolidated
financial statements as of June 30, 1994 and is exclusive of any future
insurance recoveries.  The tentative settlement is subject to the approval of
the Department of Justice before it is presented to the Court in the form of a
proposed consent decree.  The consent decree will become binding on Pretty
Products and the registrant when it is approved and entered by the Court, which
is expected to occur prior to December 31, 1994.  If approved, it is
anticipated the registrant will pay the claims during fiscal 1995.  It is the
opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse affect on its financial condition or results of
operations, whether or not it obtains recovery from its insurance companies.

         AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

For the third consecutive year, Lancaster Colony Corporation achieved record
levels of net sales and net income. During its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994,
net sales totaled $721,732,000 reflecting a 14% increase over the previous
year's record total of $630,627,000. Net sales totaled $555,793,000 in fiscal
1992. These increases in consolidated net sales primarily reflect the effects
of significant growth in unit volumes recorded by each of the Company's three
operating segments.

Consolidated gross margins, as well as the level of consolidated operating
income, can be significantly affected by the relative proportion of sales
contributed by each of the Company's operating segments. Generally, sales
within the Specialty Foods segment provide higher gross margins but incur
greater selling costs than do sales of the other operating segments. The
segment sales mix and related operating income experienced over the last three
years can be summarized as follows:

</TABLE>
For fiscal 1994, the consolidated gross margin percentage of 32.2% remained
essentially unchanged from that of 1993. A favorable sales mix combined with
productivity improvements helped offset the effects of higher raw material
costs incurred within  the Specialty Foods segment.  Fiscal 1993 margins
increased to 32.2% from 31.5% in 1992 due to an increased proportion of
specialty food sales as well as productivity improvements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1994 totaled $131,428,000,
which reflects a 5% increase in such costs from 1993. Compared to 1992 levels,
such operating expenses increased 8% in 1993 primarily as a result of higher
sales. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 18.2%, 19.8% and
20.8% in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The 1994 percentage was affected 
by the curtailment of selected promotional activities within the Specialty 
Foods segment during the latter half of the fiscal year.

As affected by increased sales and improved operating efficiencies discussed
above, operating income for 1994 of $100,668,000 increased 29% over the prior
year total of $78,027,000. For similar reasons, operating income in 1993
increased over the 1992 level of $59,679,000 by 31%.

Interest expense during 1994 totaled $2,849,000 compared to $3,625,000 and
$5,584,000 incurred in 1993 and 1992, respectively. This trend has resulted
from reduced levels of borrowings during the respective periods as well as from
the generally lower interest rates present in 1994 and 1993.

The Company's overall effective tax rate during 1994 increased to 39% compared
to 38% in 1993. This increase reflects the August 1993 enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which increased the statutory marginal
Federal income tax rate to 35% from 34%. The retroactive provisions of this
legislation also increased the current year's tax provision by $343,000. During
fiscal 1992, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109 were adopted although the impact to that year's financial statements was
not significant.  See Note 7 to the accompanying financial statements for
additional information regarding income taxes provided for each period.





                                                                        3

SEGMENT REVIEW - SPECIALTY FOODS
Net sales of the Specialty Foods segment during 1994 totaled $289,734,000, a
15% increase over 1993 sales of $252,288,000. The latter year's sales had also
increased over 1992 sales of $212,349,000 by 19%. Over the last five years,
sales have grown at an average compound rate of approximately 14%. Contributing
to growth within the last three years has been this segment's expanded
geographic market penetration, particularly toward the West Coast. This effort
has been assisted by the fiscal 1992 acquisition of a California manufacturing
facility. The addition of new national foodservice accounts as well as new
products have also played an important role in recent years, with the 1994
results also being impacted by the July 1993 acquisition of Romanoff caviars
and related product lines.

As a percentage of net sales, operating income of $42,542,000 for 1994 was 15%
which was comparable to the same percentage in 1993 and 14% in 1992. The
increase in operating income over the last three years has been driven
primarily through increases in sales volumes. However, in fiscal 1994, the
effects of increased raw material costs incurred within this segment were
minimized by the reduction of certain promotional activities as well as by the
implementation of selected price increases.

SEGMENT REVIEW - AUTOMOTIVE
The Automotive segment's sales increased 16% in fiscal 1994 to $235,287,000
compared to 1993 sales of $203,079,000. The latter year's sales had increased
15% from 1992 sales of $176,762,000. Sales growth of the Company's automotive
products during these periods was influenced by a pattern of increasing
domestic sales of new automobiles and light trucks. The Automotive segment's
sales to original equipment manufacturers over the last three years have
increased as a percentage of total segment sales from 38% in fiscal 1992 to 44%
in 1993 and 45% in 1994.  Additionally, growth in the sales of domestic new
light trucks and vans have out-paced the increase in automotive sales causing
the Company's aftermarket lines of truck and van accessories to also experience
strong growth. 

The increased sales volumes, combined with the implementation of productivity 
improvements, have provided manufacturing efficiencies which permitted this 
segment's operating income to increase from 12% of net sales in 1992 and 1993 
to 13% in 1994. Operating margins within the Automotive segment are expected 
to remain constrained by the restrictive pricing programs present throughout 
much of the original equipment markets. Accordingly, continued enhancements of 
manufacturing processes will be important in assuring satisfactory levels of 
future operating margins.

SEGMENT REVIEW -
GLASSWARE AND CANDLES
Increased sales of candles have led the sales growth of this segment during
each of the last two years. Net sales in 1994 totaled $196,711,000, a 12%
increase over the 1993 total of $175,260,000. Sales of new candle products,
particularly wax-filled glass items marketed under the brand name Candle-lite,
have significantly contributed to this growth. Also affecting this segment's
sales during 1994 was a recovery in the sales of industrial glassware products
which had experienced a decline in 1993 due to unfavorable economic conditions
faced by customers in this market.

Operating income of the Glassware and Candles segment during 1994 increased to
16% of net sales compared to 12% during 1993 and 9% in 1992.  Factors
contributing to this improved operating margin include the presence of a more
favorable sales mix, volume-driven efficiencies and the installation of new
machinery utilized to improve manufacturing processes. With respect to the new
line of wax-filled glass products, synergies are also being attained through 
the production of glass components used within this product line.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash flows from operating activities during 1994 totaled $61,092,000 compared
to $61,733,000 in 1993. These amounts were affected by an increase in net
working capital of $37,798,000 in 1994 compared to 1993 and an increase of
$29,641,000 in 1993 compared to 1992. The 1994 working capital increase
reflects a volume-driven increase in accounts receivable as well as a growth in
inventories reflecting higher sales and a planned build of certain seasonal
inventories within the Glassware and Candles segment.

The Company has established a considerable degree of financial flexibility over
the last five years through its reduction of debt and its profit-driven growth
in equity. Including short- and long-term debt within total capitalization, the
Company's debt to capital percentage was 13% at June 30, 1994 compared to 16%
at June 30, 1993. For perspective, this percentage was 40% at June 30, 1989.
Management believes that liquidity for internal expansion and dividend
requirements during fiscal 1995 will be sufficiently provided by cash flows
from operating activities. The Company also continues to maintain discretionary
bank lines of credit in excess of $150,000,000 to provide additional access to
liquidity if required.

Significant uses of cash during 1994 included expenditures for property
additions totaling $23,532,000 compared to $18,921,000 in 1993 and $17,040,000
in 1992. The Company also expended approximately $5,438,000 in July 1993 to
acquire the operating assets of a specialty foods operation specializing in the
distribution of caviar and related products. Other significant 1994
expenditures included $7,718,000 for the purchase of treasury stock. During
fiscal 1995, management will continue to consider opportunities for additional
business acquisitions and review the benefits of further treasury stock
purchases.

Weighted average shares outstanding during each of the last three years were
impacted by the declaration of stock splits including a three-for-two stock
split paid in 1992, a four-for-three stock split paid in 1993 and a
four-for-three stock split declared in fiscal 1994 and paid in July 1994.
Shares issued were affected in 1992 by the retirement of all the treasury
shares then-outstanding. Also during 1992, common stock was converted to stock
with no par value to coincide with the Company's reorganization as an Ohio
corporation. This resulted in the elimination of additional capital as a
separate balance sheet caption.

Not unlike other companies with a significant manufacturing base, the Company
continues to incur certain costs and provide for necessary capital expenditures
needed to comply with various environmental laws and regulations. It is clear
that the trend in recent years has been for these requirements to become
increasingly more complex and stringent. The extent to which these compliance
costs may be ongoing is difficult to measure but is not believed to be material
to financial operations. From time to time, the Company also communicates with
regulatory authorities regarding various environmental matters and is currently
named as a "potentially responsible party" in a legal action brought under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act relating
to a landfill site in Ohio. The Company believes that the resolution of this
matter should occur in fiscal 1995 and will not materially affect its results
of operations or financial condition.


IMPACT OF INFLATION
The margins of the Specialty Foods segment were affected during 1994 by
increased average market prices for soybean oil, a primary ingredient in
several product lines of this segment. It is anticipated that the
implementation of selected price adjustments should minimize the impact of
these higher costs which still persist. With the exception of soybean oil, the
last three years have otherwise remained a period of relatively stable costs
and inflation is therefore not believed to have had a significant impact on
gross margins or operating expenses.

As mentioned above, the Company attempts to adjust its selling prices to offset
the effects of increased raw material costs whenever possible.  However, these
adjustments have historically been difficult to implement on a timely basis
relative to the increase in costs incurred by the Company. The Company's
presence in diverse operations tends to minimize the inflationary risks
associated with reliance on a limited number and type of purchased materials.
Furthermore, the continuous implementation of productivity improvements in
manufacturing and distribution operations have lead to reduced unit costs of
production over time.

                               -----------------
                    FOR THE YEARS ENDED 1994, 1993 AND 1992
The business segments of the Company are defined as Specialty Foods, Automotive
and Glassware and Candles.

SPECIALTY FOODS--includes production and marketing of a family of pourable and
refrigerated produce salad dressings, sauces, refrigerated produce vegetable
dips, chip dips, dairy snacks and desserts, dry and frozen egg noodles, caviar,
frozen ready-to-bake pies and frozen hearth-baked breads.

AUTOMOTIVE--includes production and marketing of rubber, vinyl and
carpet-on-rubber car mats both for original equipment manufacturers and
importers and for the auto aftermarket; truck and trailer splash guards; pickup
truck bed mats and liners; aluminum running boards for pickup trucks and vans;
and a broad line of auto accessories and components.

GLASSWARE AND CANDLES--includes the production and marketing of table and
giftware consisting of domestic glassware, both machine pressed and machine
blown, imported glassware and candles in all popular sizes, shapes and scents;
industrial glass and lighting components;  distribution of a variety of the
Company's products to commercial markets; and glass floral containers.

Operating income represents net sales less operating expenses related to the
business segments. Expenses of a general corporate nature, including interest
expense and income taxes, have not been allocated to business segments.
Identifiable assets for each segment include those assets used in its
operations and intangible assets allocated to purchased businesses. Corporate
assets consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and deferred income taxes.

The 1992 capital expenditures of the Specialty Foods Group included property
from the purchase of a California manufacturing operation totaling $4,268,000.
Specialty Foods expenditures would have been $2,741,000 and total capital
expenditures would have been $17,040,000 without this purchase.

Foreign operations and export sales are not significant, and no single customer
accounts for 10% or more of consolidated net sales.

The following sets forth certain financial information attributable to the
Company's business segments for the three years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and
1992:

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   ------------------------------------------
                 LANCASTER COLONY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
                             The accompanying consolidated financial statements
                             include the accounts of Lancaster Colony
                             Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
                             collectively referred to as the "Company". All
                             significant intercompany transactions have been
                             eliminated.

                             CASH EQUIVALENTS
                             The Company considers all highly liquid
                             investments purchased with maturities of three
                             months or less to be cash equivalents.

                             INVENTORIES
                             Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
                             market. Inventories which comprise approximately
                             25% and 22% of total inventories at June 30, 1994
                             and 1993, respectively, are costed on a last-in,
                             first-out (LIFO) basis.  Inventories which are
                             costed by various other methods approximate actual
                             cost on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

                             PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
                             The Company uses the straight-line method of
                             computing depreciation for financial reporting
                             purposes based on the estimated useful lives of
                             the corresponding assets. For tax purposes, the
                             Company generally computes depreciation using
                             accelerated methods.

                             OTHER ASSETS
                             Included in other assets at June 30, 1994 is the
                             cost in excess of net assets of purchased
                             subsidiaries. Of this cost, $10,228,000 (net of
                             accumulated amortization of $3,338,000) relates to
                             companies acquired after October 31, 1970, and is
                             being amortized over fifteen to forty years.
                             Excess cost of $2,243,000 relates to a company
                             acquired prior to November 1, 1970, and is not
                             being amortized because, in the opinion of
                             management, there has been no diminution in value.

                             The remaining other assets consist of deferred
                             costs which are amortized over their estimated
                             useful lives; costs of patents acquired which are
                             amortized over their estimated remaining economic
                             lives; and other miscellaneous assets. Management
                             periodically evaluates the future economic benefit
                             of its long-lived intangible assets and
                             appropriately adjusts those assets which are
                             determined to have been impaired.

                             REVENUE RECOGNITION
                             Net sales and related cost of sales are recognized
                             upon shipment of products. Net sales are recorded
                             net of estimated sales discounts and returns.

                             PER SHARE INFORMATION
                             Net income per common share is computed based on
                             the weighted average number of shares of common
                             stock and common stock equivalents (stock options)
                             outstanding during each period.

                             On July 20, 1994 and April 15, 1993, a
                             four-for-three stock split was effected whereby
                             one additional common share was issued for each
                             three shares outstanding to shareholders of record
                             on June 20, 1994 and March 15, 1993, respectively.
                             Additionally, on April 30, 1992, a three-for-two
                             stock split was effected whereby one additional
                             common share was issued for each two shares
                             outstanding to shareholders of record on April 2,
                             1992. Accordingly, net income per common share and
                             all other per share information appearing in the
                             consolidated financial statements and notes
                             thereto have been retroactively adjusted for these
                             splits where appropriate.

                             CREDIT RISK
                             Financial instruments which potentially subject
                             the Company to concentrations of credit risk
                             consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade
                             accounts receivable. The Company places its cash
                             equivalents with high-quality institutions and, by
                             policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to
                             any one institution. Concentration of credit risk
                             with respect to trade accounts receivable is not
                             material, as the Company has a large diverse
                             customer base with no single customer accounting
                             for a significant percentage of trade accounts
                             receivable.

                             BUSINESS SEGMENTS
                             The business segments information for 1994, 1993
                             and 1992 included in this Annual Report is an 
                             integral part of these financial statements.

2. ACQUISITIONS               In July 1993, the Company acquired substantially
                              all of the net operating assets and customer base
                              of a specialty foods marketer of caviar and other
                              specialty food products for cash of approximately
                              $5,438,000. In November 1991, the Company
                              acquired substantially all of the assets of a
                              California salad dressing operation for cash of
                              approximately $5,100,000. Both aquisitions were
                              accounted for under the purchase method of
                              accounting. The results of operations of these
                              entities have been included in the consolidated
                              financial statements from the date of acquisition
                              and are immaterial in relation to the
                              consolidated totals.

3. INVENTORIES                If the FIFO method (which approximates current
                              cost) of inventory accounting had been used for
                              inventories costed on a LIFO basis, these
                              inventories would have been $12,553,000 and
                              $13,147,000 higher than reported at June 30, 1994
                              and 1993, respectively.

                              It is not practicable to segregate work in
                              process from finished goods inventories.
                              Management estimates, however, that work in
                              process inventories amount to 10% or less of the
                              combined total of finished goods and work in
                              process inventories at June 30, 1994 and 1993.

4. SHORT-TERM BANK LOANS      Short-term bank loans (generally for terms not
                              exceeding ninety days) represent unsecured
                              borrowings under various credit arrangements. The
                              Company had unused lines of credit for short-term
                              borrowings from various banks at June 30, 1994,
                              1993 and 1992 of $169,000,000, $179,000,000 and
                              $156,500,000, respectively. The lines of credit
                              are granted at the discretion of the lending
                              banks and are generally subject to periodic
                              review.

                              The weighted average interest rate on short-term
                              bank borrowings at June 30, 1992 was 4.1%. The
                              maximum aggregate short-term borrowings
                              outstanding at any month end during the years
                              ending June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were
                              $10,500,000, $21,000,000 and $32,500,000,
                              respectively. The average amounts of short-term

                 The net book value of property subject to lien at June
                 30, 1994 was approximately $4,327,000. The Company has entered
                 into various capital lease agreements in connection with
                 equipment used in its operations. Such equipment at June 30,
                 1994 and 1993 had a capitalized cost of approximately
                 $2,028,000 and $2,942,000 and related net book value of
                 $507,000 and $1,131,000, respectively.

                 No material debt was assumed for the purchase of property
                 additions in 1994, 1993 and 1992. Cash payments for interest
                 were $2,868,000, $3,664,000 and $6,263,000 for 1994,
                 1993 and 1992, respectively.

                 Various debt agreements require the maintenance of certain
                 financial statement amounts and ratios, including a
                 requirement to maintain a specified minimum net worth, as
                 defined. At  June 30, 1994, the Company exceeded this net
                 worth requirement by approximately $93,704,000.

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY       As approved by the Company's shareholders in
                              November 1991, the Company was reincorporated in
                              Ohio on January 2, 1992 through a merger with a
                              newly formed Ohio subsidiary. Each of the
                              Company's common stock then-outstanding was
                              thereby changed from having $1.00 par value to no
                              par value resulting in the elimination of
                              additional capital as a separate balance sheet
                              amount. Also pursuant to this reorganization, the
                              Company is authorized to issue 2,650,000 shares
                              of preferred stock consisting of 350,000 shares
                              of Class A Participating Preferred Stock with
                              $1.00 par value, 1,150,000 shares of Class B
                              Voting Preferred Stock without par value and
                              1,150,000 shares of Class C Nonvoting Preferred
                              Stock without par value.

                              In April 1990, the Company's Board of Directors
                              adopted a Rights Agreement, the terms of which
                              were unaffected by the January 1992
                              reorganization.  This Agreement provides for one
                              preferred share purchase right to be associated
                              with each share of the  Company's outstanding
                              common stock. Shareholders exercising these
                              rights would become entitled to purchase shares
                              of Class A Participating Preferred Stock. The
                              rights may be exercised on or after the time when
                              a person or group of persons without the approval
                              of the Board of Directors acquire beneficial
                              ownership of 15 percent or more of the Company's
                              common stock or announce the initiation of a
                              tender or exchange offer which if successful
                              would cause such person or group to beneficially
                              own 30 percent or more of the common stock. Such
                              exercise may ultimately entitle the holders of
                              the rights to purchase for $70 per right common
                              stock of the Company having a market value of
                              $140. The person or groups effecting such 15
                              percent acquisition or undertaking such tender
                              offer will not be entitled to exercise any
                              rights. These rights expire April 2000 unless
                              earlier redeemed by the Company under
                              circumstances permitted by the Rights Agreement.

9. STOCK OPTIONS              Under terms of an incentive stock option plan as
                              amended and approved by the shareholders, the
                              Company reserved 3,625,000 common shares for
                              issuance to qualified key employees. Shares
                              available for future grants at June 30, 1994
                              total 990,747 shares. All options granted are
                              exercisable at prices not less than fair market
                              value as of the date of grant.

10. PENSION AND OTHER        PENSION PLANS:
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS      The Company and certain of its operating 
                             subsidiaries sponsor five noncontributory defined
                             benefit plans  which cover the union workers at
                             such locations. Additionally, the Company and
                             certain of its operating subsidiaries participate
                             in two multiemployer defined benefit plans
                             covering the union workers at such locations.
                             Benefits under these plans are primarily based on
                             negotiated rates and years of service. The Company
                             contributes to these pension funds at least the    
                             minimum amount required by regulation or
                             contract.

                              The majority of plan assets are invested in
                              bonds, short-term investments and common stocks
                              including shares of the Company's common stock
                              with a market value of $3,296,000, $4,198,000 and
                              $3,006,000 as of June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
                              respectively. The weighted average discount rates
                              used in determining the projected benefit
                              obligation for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were 7.7%,
                              7.0% and 7.7%, respectively. The expected
                              long-term rate of return on assets was 9.0% for
                              the three years.

                              EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN:
                              The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership
                              Plan (ESOP). In April 1990, the Company loaned
                              $10,000,000 to the Lancaster Colony Corporation
                              ESOP for the purpose of purchasing the Company's
                              common stock in furtherance of the objectives of
                              the Plan. The Company funded this transaction
                              primarily through short-term bank borrowings.
                              With the proceeds and as adjusted for all stock
                              splits since April 1990, the ESOP effectively
                              purchased 1,194,390 shares of the Company's
                              common stock in the open market.

                              The ESOP is fully paid by the Company and
                              generally provides coverage to all domestic
                              employees, except those covered by a collective
                              bargaining agreement. Contributions to the ESOP
                              are to be not less than that required by the
                              terms of the loan agreement between the Company
                              and the ESOP. The Company uses the
                              shares-allocated method of accounting in
                              determining the amount of expense related to each
                              contribution.

                              As of June 30, 1994, the amount due from the ESOP
                              is recorded as a reduction in shareholders'
                              equity and represents the Company's prepayment of
                              future contributions to the ESOP. This amount
                              will be expensed over not more than the next
                              three years. Dividends accumulated on the
                              Company's unallocated common stock held by the
                              ESOP are used to repay the loan to the Company.
                              Accordingly, the pretax expense associated with
                              1994, 1993 and 1992 totaled $1,008,000, $994,000
                              and $981,000, which is net of dividends of
                              $270,000, $285,000 and $297,000 on the
                              unallocated shares, respectively.

                              In November 1993, the Accounting Standards
                              Executive Committee issued Statement of Position
                              93-6, "Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock
                              Ownership Plans". This Statement will not effect
                              the Company's accounting treatment of existing
                              shares purchased by the ESOP discussed above.
                              However, any future purchases of the Company's
                              stock by the ESOP will require the adoption of
                              this Statement.

                              POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:
                              In addition to pension benefits, the Company also
                              provides certain employees other postretirement
                              benefits including health care and life insurance
                              coverage. As of June 30, 1994, the Company
                              provides such coverage under three active benefit
                              plans of which two relate to collectively
                              bargained benefits. In general, all eligible
                              employees are entitled to receive medical and
                              life insurance benefits upon meeting certain age
                              and service requirements at the time of their
                              retirement.

                              The Company recognizes the cost of postretirement
                              medical and life insurance benefits as the
                              employees render service in accordance with
                              Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                              (SFAS) No. 106. Relevant information with respect
                              to these postretirement benefits as of June 30,
                              1994 and 1993 can be summarized as follows:

                              For 1994, annual increases in medical costs are
                              initially assumed to total approximately 10% per  
                              year and gradually declining to 5% by
                              approximately year 2005. Annual increases in
                              medical costs for 1993 were assumed to total
                              approximately 12% per year and gradually
                              declining to 5% by approximately year 2005.

                              The Company and certain of its subsidiaries
                              participate in two multiemployer plans that
                              provide various postretirement health and welfare
                              benefits to the union workers at such locations.
                              The Company's contributions required by its
                              participation in the multiemployer plans totaled
                              $996,000, $832,000 and $726,000 in 1994, 1993 and

                              POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS:

                              The Financial Accounting Standards Board has
                              issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
                              Postemployment Benefits," which requires
                              employers to accrue for postemployment benefits
                              provided to former or inactive employees, their
                              beneficiaries and covered dependents after
                              employment, but before retirement. This change
                              must be implemented by the Company no later than
                              the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1994.
                              Management has determined that the new statement
                              will not have a material effect on the
                              consolidated financial statements of the Company.



11. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES        

                              The Company has operating leases with initial
                              noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year,
                              covering the rental of various facilities and
                              equipment, which expire at various dates through
                              fiscal 2004.  Certain of these leases contain
                              renewal options, some provide options to purchase
                              during the lease term and some require contingent
                              rentals based on usage. The future minimum rental
                              commitments due under these leases are summarized
                              as follows:

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Lancaster Colony Corporation and
its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
