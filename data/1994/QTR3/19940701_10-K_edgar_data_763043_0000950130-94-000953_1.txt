Item 1.  Business
         --------

General

  Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") manufactures and markets various
dosages of generic drugs. Generic drugs are the chemical and therapeutic
equivalents of brand name drugs which generally have gained market acceptance
while under patent protection. Although subject to strict Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") standards, generic drugs are sold under their chemical
(generic) names, typically at prices substantially below those of their brand 
name equivalents.

  Sales of generic drugs have increased significantly in recent years, due in
part to greater awareness and acceptance of generic drugs by physicians,
pharmacists and the public. Among the factors which have contributed to this
increased awareness and acceptance are the modification of state laws to permit
pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brand name drugs (where authorized
or not expressly prohibited by the prescribing physician), and the publication
by the FDA of a list of therapeutic equivalent drugs which provides physicians
and pharmacists with the names of generic drug alternatives. In addition, since
generic drugs are typically sold at prices significantly below the price of
brand name drugs,

                                       1
<PAGE>
 
the prescribing of generic drugs has been encouraged, and in many cases
required, by various government agencies and by many private health programs as
a cost-saving measure in the purchase of, or reimbursement for, prescription
drugs.

Products and Product Development

  The Company presently manufactures various dosages of 25 prescription drugs,
and one prescription veterinary drug constituting an aggregate of 73 products.
Governmental approvals were required and obtained for each of these products.
The Company's products are sold in various oral dosage forms, including
compressed tablets, two-piece hard-shell capsules, powders for oral solution or
suspension and liquids. As of March 31, 1994, the Company was awaiting FDA
approvals to market 14 generic drugs constituting 26 products. The Company
intends to submit to the FDA applications to approve 11 new generic drugs
constituting a variety of products during fiscal 1995. See "Government
Regulations."

  The 26 drugs manufactured by the Company can be divided into 11 categories.
The number of products in each category is shown in parentheses.

  1. Penicillin and Semi-Synthetic Penicillin Drugs (23): These antibiotic drugs
include Penicillin V Potassium and the semi-synthetic penicillin drugs
Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, Cloxacillin, Dicloxacillin and Oxacillin.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
  2.  Cephalosporin Drugs (10): These antibiotic drugs are Cephradine and
Cephalexin.

  3. Other Antibiotic Drugs (6): These drugs are Cinoxacin, Clindamycin,
Minocycline HCl, Neomycin and Nystatin.

  4.  Analgesic Drug (3):  This drug is Ketoprofen.

  5. Anti-Infective Drugs (5): These drugs are Trimethoprim and a combination of
Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim.

  6.  Anti-Depressant Drugs (8): These drugs are Amitriptyline Hydrochloride and
Imipramine Hydrochloride.

  7. Bronchial Dilator Drugs (5): These drugs are Albuterol and Metaproterenol.

  8. Cardiovascular Drugs (3): These drugs are Disopyramide Phosphate and
Amiloride Hydrochloride with Hydrochlorothiazide.

  9. Gastrointestinal Drug (3): This drug is Metoclopramide. 

 10. Anti-Spasmodic Drug (2): This drug is Baclofen.

 11. Veterinary Drugs (5): The drug in this category is Amoxicillin, an
antibiotic sold under the registered trademark "Biomox."

  The Company also manufactures the active ingredients it uses in its semi-
synthetic penicillin drugs at its Waldwick, New Jersey facility and bulk form
Cephalexin at its Mexico, Missouri facility. Such active ingredients are from
time to time sold in bulk form, generally in small amounts. Chemical
intermediates for antibiotic production are also manufactured in its Mexico,
Missouri
                                       3

<PAGE>
 
facility. In March 1994, the Company received FDA approval to manufacture bulk
form Amoxicillin and Ampicillin in its plant in Missouri.

  The Company's research and development activities generally consist of new
generic drug product development, clinical studies for generic and non-generic
drugs and research for developing new bulk manufacturing processes. In the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1992, 1993 and 1994, total research and development
expenditures were approximately $8,755,000, $8,662,000 and $9,923,000,
respectively.

  The Company's primary product development strategies are to manufacture and
sell in generic form antibiotic drugs for which the Company can maintain certain
cost controls by manufacturing the chemical intermediates and/or active
ingredients in bulk. Generally, the Company also selects non-antibiotic drugs
for which the Company anticipates initially limited competition due to such
factors as extensive FDA approval requirements, complexity of manufacture or
limited availability of raw materials. In all cases, the Company seeks to obtain
FDA approval to market a new generic drug product by, or shortly after, the
patent expiration date of the equivalent brand name drug in order to be among
the first generic drug companies to offer a generic equivalent at a
substantially lower price. Since the development of a generic drug product,
including its formulation, testing and FDA approval,

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
generally takes approximately three to four years, development activities for a
product may begin several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the
brand name drug equivalent. Consequently, the Company is presently selecting
drugs it expects to market several years in the future.

  The Company is developing certain drugs which the FDA has determined require
clinical studies in order to obtain approval of a generic equivalent. Completion
of these clinical studies involves larger numbers of subjects and longer periods
of time and results in greater expenditures than do bioequivalency studies which
are required for most generic drugs. The Company is currently awaiting FDA
approval of one such drug, Sucralfate, an ulcer medication.

  The Company is considering developing, manufacturing and selling drugs which
require New Drug Applications. The process of obtaining FDA approval of these
types of drugs typically requires greater expenditures by the Company than
approval of most generic drugs and often takes many years to complete. To market
these drugs, it will be necessary to familiarize physicians, pharmacists and the
public with the effects of such drugs. Since the Company has no experience in
this type of marketing, no assurance can be given that the Company will have the
ability itself, or that it will be able to make arrangements with others, to
market these drugs in such manner.

                                       5

Marketing and Customers

  The Company sells its products primarily through 12 salaried employees. Sales
of drugs in dosage forms are made primarily to distributors, drug wholesalers,
drugstore chains, mass merchandisers, other drug manufacturers, health care
institutions and government agencies. More than half of the Company's gross
sales of drugs in dosage form is made under its own label and the balance is
made under customers' labels; however, in all cases the Company is named on the
label as the manufacturer.

  The Company sells dosage form products to approximately 400 customers.  No
single customer accounted for over 10% of total net sales in fiscal 1992, 1993
or 1994.

  In fiscal 1992, 1993 and 1994, sales of cephalosporins constituted
approximately 27%, 24% and 27%, respectively, of total gross sales. For the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1992, 1993 and 1994, penicillin and semi-synthetic
penicillin drugs accounted for approximately 41%, 33% and 36%, respectively, of
total gross sales.

  A key element of the Company's marketing strategy is to attempt to maintain
sufficient inventories of products in order to fill customer orders generally
within a one to four week period. This strategy requires a substantial amount of
working capital to 

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
maintain inventories at a level sufficient to meet anticipated demand.

Competition

  The Company competes in varying degrees with numerous foreign and domestic
companies in the health care industry, including other manufacturers of generic
drugs (among which are several major pharmaceutical companies) and manufacturers
of brand name drugs.  Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial
and other resources and are, therefore, able to expend more effort than the
Company in areas such as marketing and product development.

  The principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market are the
ability to introduce generic versions of brand name drugs promptly after patent
expiration, price, quality and customer service.

Raw Materials

  The principal raw materials of the Company's business are active ingredients
for non-penicillin drugs and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals. The bulk
pharmaceutical chemicals are used to 

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
manufacture bulk form antibiotics. Both types of raw materials are generally
available from multiple sources.

  Because the FDA requires specification of raw material suppliers in
applications for approval of drug products, if raw materials from a specified
supplier were to become unavailable, the required FDA approval of a new supplier
could cause a delay in the manufacture of the drug involved. To date, the
Company has not experienced any significant delay and it does not expect any
such delays in the future.

Employees

  As of April 1, 1994, the Company had approximately 750 full-time employees.
Approximately 115 administrative and professional personnel are engaged, at
least part of their time, in product development, including market research,
product selection and formulation, and in seeking FDA approvals of dosage form
products. Approximately 290 employees are represented by a local collective
bargaining unit whose agreement with the Company expires June 30, 1994. An
agreement in principle has been reached with the collective bargaining unit
concerning a new agreement. Management believes that its relations with
employees are satisfactory.

Government Regulation

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
  All pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the
federal government, principally by the FDA, and to a lesser extent by state and
local governments. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled
Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence
the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval,
pricing, advertising and promotion of the Company's products. Noncompliance with
applicable requirements can result in fines, recall and seizure of product,
total or partial suspension of production, delays in receiving approval of new
drug applications, refusal to enter into government supply contracts and
criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to revoke approvals of
drugs.

  FDA approval is required before each dosage form of any new drug can be
marketed. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to
bioequivalency, product formulation, stability, manufacturing processes,
packaging, labeling and quality control. Validation of manufacturing processes
is also generally required before a Company may market new products. There are
generally two types of applications currently used to obtain FDA approval of a
new drug.

  1. New Drug Application ("NDA"). Generally, with respect to drugs with active
ingredients not previously approved by the FDA, a 

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
prospective manufacturer must conduct and submit to the FDA complete clinical
studies to prove that drug's safety and efficacy. An NDA may also be submitted
for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if the abbreviated
procedure discussed below is not available.

  2.  Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA").  The Drug Price Competition and
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the "Drug Price Act") established an
abbreviated procedure for obtaining FDA approval for generic drugs already
approved for sale in the United States.  Under the ANDA procedure, which applies
to most previously approved drugs, the FDA waives the requirement of conducting
complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy and instead requires data
illustrating that the generic drug formulation is bioequivalent to a previously
approved drug.  "Bioequivalence" indicates that the rate of absorption and the
levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body needed to produce a
therapeutic effect are substantially equivalent to those of the previously
approved drug.  In certain cases, however, the FDA may require clinical studies
in order to show generic equivalence to a previously approved drug.

  Although antibiotic and veterinary drugs are classified separately for
purposes of FDA approval, the procedure for such drugs conforms substantially to
the NDA/ANDA procedures.

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
  None of the products currently marketed by the Company, other than veterinary
drugs, have required a full NDA or the equivalent application.

  The Drug Price Act also created new statutory protections for brand name
drugs. Under certain circumstances the term of a product or use patent can be
extended for up to five years or provide an exclusivity period of two to ten
years.

  Under the Drug Price Act, the effective date of approval of most generic drugs
will ordinarily be delayed until the expiration of patents covering the product
or until a court has determined the patent to be invalid or not infringed.  If a
manufacturer files an ANDA certifying that it believes a patent is invalid or
not infringed and successfully defends itself in patent litigation, it may
receive exclusive marketing rights for the generic version of the product for a
period of 180 days.  These provisions do not apply to antibiotics.

  The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 was enacted in May 1992 as a result
of findings of corruption in the FDA's process of approving generic drugs. The
law establishes procedures to bar individuals who have been convicted of certain
crimes from working for companies that manufacture or distribute such products
and delays the review and approval of ANDAs submitted by or with the assistance
of debarred individuals. The law also provides, under certain circumstances, for
debarment of corporations and "high 

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
managerial agents" as defined in the Act, withdrawal of approvals of ANDAs and
civil penalties for both individuals and corporations. The Company does not
expect the law to have a material impact on the review or approval of the
Company's ANDAs.

  Among the requirements for new drug approvals is the requirement that the
prospective manufacturer's methods conform to the FDA's current good
manufacturing practices standards ("cGMP Regulations").  The cGMP Regulations
must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured.
In complying with the standards set forth in these regulations, the Company must
continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality
control in order to achieve compliance.  Failure to so comply risks possible FDA
action such as the suspension of manufacturing, withdrawal of ANDAs or the
seizure of drug products.   The Company is in discussions with the FDA over
issues arising from an inspection in May 1994.  The FDA has requested that it
take additional steps to remedy alleged noncompliance with cGMP
Regulations primarily as they relate to some of the Company's products.  The
Company believes that its marketed products meet appropriate standards and are
safe and effective, and that it is in substantial compliance with cGMP
Regulations.  Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of these
discussions and no assurances can be made, it is hopeful that 

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
a mutually acceptable resolution can be reached with the FDA without litigation.
Pending resolution of such issues, new drug approvals may continue to be
delayed.

  In November 1990, Congress passed, as part of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990, The Medicaid Prudent Purchasing Act (the "Medicaid
Rebate Act"). The Medicaid Rebate Act, with respect to generic pharmaceuticals,
requires all manufacturers whose products are covered by the Medicaid Program,
to rebate to each state a percentage (currently 11% in the case of products sold
by the Company) of the manufacturer's average net sales price, for all products
dispensed by pharmacists pursuant to Medicaid. Additional rules, which apply
with respect to nongeneric pharmaceuticals, are not currently applicable to the
Company. In addition, several states, including New Jersey, New York,
California, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, have enacted similar legislation with
respect to programs other than Medicaid.

  The Company also is governed by federal, state and local laws of general
applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions.  In addition, the
Company is subject, as are manufacturers generally, to various federal, state
and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including those
governing the discharge of materials into the environment.  

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
  Compliance with such environmental provisions is not expected to have a
material effect on the earnings, cash requirements or competitive position of
the Company in the foreseeable future. See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to
pending environmental matters.

Item 2.  Properties
         ----------

  The executive offices and production, laboratory and warehouse facilities of
the Company occupy an aggregate of approximately 347,000 square feet in seven
facilities. The Company's principal executive offices, its 49,000 square foot
warehouse and distribution center are located in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

  Penicillin and semi-synthetic penicillin dosage form production operations and
a quality control laboratory are located in the Company's plant of approximately
37,000 square feet in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, approximately 4 miles from the
executive offices. The Company's plant in Paterson, New Jersey, one mile from
the Elmwood Park facility, is approximately 48,000 square feet and is used for
the manufacture of dosage form products other than penicillins and
cephalosporins. Dosage form cephalosporin drug products are produced at the
Company's 56,000 square foot facility 

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
located in Fairfield, New Jersey, approximately 15 miles from the executive
offices. It also contains a quality control laboratory.

  The Company manufactures the active ingredients used in its semisynthetic
penicillin drugs at its plant of approximately 15,000 square feet in Waldwick,
New Jersey, approximately 5 miles from the executive offices.  The Waldwick
plant also houses the Company's laboratories for microbiology, quality control
for bulk form penicillin manufacturing and research and development for bulk
form antibiotics.  Raw materials and finished inventory for the Waldwick plant
are stored in a warehouse of approximately 17,000 square feet which is adjacent
to the Waldwick plant.

  The Company completed construction of a facility to manufacture pharmaceutical
intermediates and bulk antibiotics in Mexico, Missouri in fiscal 1992.  The
plant is approximately 125,000 square feet and contains manufacturing,
laboratory, office and warehouse facilities.  In addition, the complex includes
a solvent recovery facility and a waste disposal plant.

  All of the above property is owned by the Company. Management believes that
the Company's facilities are suitable for its requirements. These facilities
have additional capacity for expansion of production of existing and new
products. The Company owns substantially all of its manufacturing equipment and
believes that such equipment is well maintained and suitable for its
requirements.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
         -----------------

  Between November 23 and November 29, 1993, five separate actions were
commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
against the Company and Harold Snyder, Beatrice Snyder, Beryl L. Snyder, Brian
S. Snyder and Jay T. Snyder, all of whom are officers and directors of the
Company, and Steven J. Sklar, who is an officer of the Company, purporting to
allege securities fraud and common law claims on behalf of purchasers of the
Company's stock. Thereafter, pursuant to an Order of the Court, the five actions
were consolidated under the caption In re Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. Securities
                                    --------------------------------------------
Litigation, and a Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (the
- - ----------
"Complaint") was served on March 8, 1994. The Complaint purports to allege
securities fraud claims under Sections 10 (b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. (S)(S) 78(b) and 78t, and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.
(S)(S) 240.10b-5, as well as claims for common law fraud and negligent
misrepresentation, based on alleged misrepresentations and omissions in the
Company's publicly filed statements and press releases regarding the Company's
compliance with the FDA concerning the Company's manufacture of its products.
  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as
well as attorneys' fees and other costs of 

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
the lawsuit. On May 9, 1994, the Company moved to dismiss the Complaint on the
grounds that, among other things, it fails to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted.

  In February 1986, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. (Roche) obtained a declaratory
judgment that the Company was not entitled to withhold royalties under a license
for the right to manufacture and sell a patented drug, which patent expired in
June 1988. In February 1994 this matter was settled by the Company and the case
was dismissed. The Company paid Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. $250,000.

  In September 1980, the Company entered into an administrative consent order
with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to
which the Company agreed to among other things, monitor and take certain action
to remediate contamination of the groundwater beneath the Company's Waldwick,
New Jersey plant by use of microbiological decontamination wells which were
installed in fiscal 1981. This order has been modified to include action to be
taken to monitor and, if necessary remediate, possible contamination of the
groundwater below the property adjacent to the Waldwick facility. The Company
does not expect the continued cost of this remediation to be material.

  On June 8, 1989, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
notified the Company that it was a potentially responsible party (PRP) along
with other generators of industrial 

                                       17

waste, the site owners and operators, and transporters of wastes to the site,
for the alleged release of hazardous substances from a waste management site in
Elkton, Maryland, known as the "Spectron Site." The Company has participated
with other PRPs in investigating and remediating the site under a Consent Order
entered into with EPA in August 1989. As of March 31, 1994, the Company has paid
to the PRP group approximately $224,000, all of which was paid in previous
years, for its share of cleanup costs, based on volumetric allocation of waste
shipments to the Spectron Site. On March 19, 1990, EPA sent another letter to
the Company notifying it of potential liability for planned additional remedial
work at the Spectron Site. This additional remedial work arises from alleged
releases of hazardous substances at the Spectron Site during the period of 1968
to 1982, known as the Galaxy Period. The Company has decided to join with other
PRPs in the negotiation of a Consent Order with EPA for the additional remedial
work related to the Galaxy Period.

  The Company is also one of more than 400 defendants in an action entitled
"Transtech Industries, Inc. et al v. A & Z Septic Clean, et al" pending in the
federal district court for New Jersey, regarding hazardous waste allegedly
shipped to the Kin-Buc Landfill in New Jersey; has been notified by the North
Carolina Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources that it
believes that the Company was one of approximately 1,500 entities that caused
hazardous material to be shipped to a waste treatment facility 

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
previously operated by the Seaboard Chemical Corporation at Jamestown, North
Carolina; and is one of more than 900 entities notified that it has shipped
hazardous waste to a site in Caldwell County, North Carolina.

  The Company is in discussions with the FDA over issues arising from an
inspection in May 1994. The FDA has requested that it take additional steps to
remedy alleged noncompliance with cGMP regulations primarily as they relate to
some of the Company's products. The Company believes that its marketed products
meet appropriate standards and are safe and effective, and that it is in
substantial compliance with cGMP regulations. Although the Company cannot
predict the outcome of these discussions and no assurances can be made, it is
hopeful that a mutually acceptable resolution can be reached with the FDA
without litigation.

       amount of the Loans being converted; provided, however, that such
                                            --------  -------
       repayment shall not be considered a prepayment under this Agreement.

initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or two (2) Business Days prior to
the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to such CD Rate Loan or LIBOR
Loan (in the case of subsequent Interest Periods), the Company shall have the
right to elect, upon notice to the Bank, the Interest Period applicable to each
borrowing of CD Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans. If any Interest Period would
otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period
shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day with respect to a CD Rate Loan,
and the next preceding Business Day with respect to a LIBOR Loan; provided,
                                                                  --------

- - ------- 
upon the expiration of any Interest Period for any CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan,
the Company has failed to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to such

have elected to convert such CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan into a Prime Rate Loan
effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

            (ii) the Company shall not make any prepayment on account of a CD
            Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan except at the end of an Interest Period
            therefor and shall give the Bank irrevocable telephonic notice of
            any permitted prepayment on account of a CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan
            not later than two (2) Business Days prior to such prepayment, and
    
            (iii) if any partial prepayment of a CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan

            LIBOR Loans remaining outstanding to less than Five Hundred Thousand
            Dollars ($500,000), then upon such prepayment all CD Rate Loans or
            LIBOR Loans, as the case may be, remaining outstanding shall be
            automatically converted into Prime Rate Loans.
    
       (b) If the Bank should accept any prepayment on account of a CD Rate Loan
       or LIBOR Loan not otherwise permitted under this Subsection 2.11 or if
       the Company should fail to make any prepayment after having given notice
       thereof, the Company shall reimburse the Bank upon demand for any costs,
       losses (including loss of profit) or expenses incurred by the Bank (all
       as reasonably determined by the Bank) as a result of such prepayment or
       failure to make prepayment.

       2.12. Illegality; Indemnity; Additional Costs.
             ----------------------------------------

       (a) If at any time due to any new Requirement of Law, or for any other
       reason arising subsequent to the date hereof, it shall become unlawful
       for the Bank to fund any CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan which it is committed
       to make hereunder, the obligation of the Bank to provide CD Rate Loans or
       LIBOR Loans, as the case may be, shall, upon the happening of such event,
       forthwith be suspended for the duration of such illegality. If any such
       Requirement of Law or other reason shall make it unlawful for the Bank to
       continue any CD Rate Loan, LIBOR Loan previously made by the Bank
       hereunder, the Bank shall give the Company notice thereof, stating the
       reasons therefor, and the Company shall, on the earlier of

            or
         
            (ii) if required by such Requirement of Law or other reason on such
            date as shall be specified in such notice, either convert each such
            unlawful CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan to Prime Rate Loans or prepay
            all such unlawful Loans, without penalty, except as provided in
            paragraph (b) of this Subsection 2.12, to the Bank in full.
         
       (b) The Company will indemnify the Bank against any loss or
       expense which the Bank may sustain
     
            (i) in employing deposits to effect, fund or maintain a CD Rate Loan
            or LIBOR Loan, as a consequence of any failure by the Company to
            make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection
            with such CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan,
         
            (ii) due to any failure of the Company to borrow, continue or
            convert a CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan on a date specified therefor in
            a notice thereof, or
         
            (iii) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any CD Rate
            Loan or LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest
            Period for such CD Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan
         
       (c)  If due to either
     
            (i) any Requirement of Law or
         
            (ii) compliance by the Bank with any request from any Governmental
            Authority, there shall be any increase in the cost to the Bank of
            agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan, the
            Company shall from time to time, upon demand by the Bank, pay to the
            Bank additional amounts sufficient to indemnify the Bank against
            such increased costs. The determination of such increased costs by
            the Bank shall be conclusive if made reasonably and in good faith.

To Our Shareholders



[PHOTO APPEARS HERE]                    In fiscal 1994 Biocraft sales set record
                                        levels, generating substantial earnings.
                                        Net sales climbed to $143 million, an
                                        increase of $30 million over fiscal
                                        1993, while earnings of $6.1 million
                                        ($.43 per share) surpassed the fiscal
                                        1993 results of $5.9 million ($.42 per
                                        share). For the fifth consecutive year,
                                        the Company paid a dividend of $.10 per
                                        share.

Product Review

  Leading the way in fiscal 1994 was our Amoxicillin chewable tablets,
introduced in fiscal 1993. In June 1993, Biocraft also commenced sales of a 5 mg
version of our gastrointestinal product, Metoclopramide.

  Our Mexico, Missouri facility was a bright spot in the year. In March 1994 the
facility received FDA approval to manufacture bulk form Amoxicillin and
Ampicillin, which is currently manufactured solely in our Waldwick, New Jersey
facility. We expect to begin to manufacture bulk form Cephradine by the end of
this year, subject to FDA approval. Because of process improvements, the cost of
manufacturing bulk form Cephalexin began to drop in the fourth quarter. Over the
mid-term (both alone and working with other companies) we expect to accelerate
entry into the manufacture of new bulk form products.

Results of Operations

  A net sales increase of $30 million or 26% over fiscal 1993, compensated for
the absence of $11.5 million that was contributed to fiscal 1993 revenue by the
Cefixime production arrangement with American Cyanamid that terminated in late
fiscal 1993.

  Moreover, gross profits improved to 23% of net sales in fiscal 1994 from 21%
in the prior year, primarily as a result of higher gross profit margins
associated with Biocraft's Amoxicillin chewable tablets, as

Quality Products

  At this writing, the Company is working to resolve regulatory issues with the
FDA.  Regardless of how this matter is resolved, I want to underscore for
shareholders, customers and employees that throughout our thirty years in the
generic drug business we have lived by our commitment to the manufacture of safe
and effective products at reasonable prices.  This has not been just a slogan at
Biocraft.  We take very seriously our responsibilities and are proud of the fact
that Biocraft has made safe and effective medication available to many consumers
where the cost of an alternative product might have been prohibitive.

Industry Outlook

  As you know, the past year saw significant strategic transactions by some of
the drug industry's largest players.  Manufacturers acquired distributors,
brand-name companies acquired or made significant investments in generic
companies, as the industry generally consolidated.  Reportedly, these moves were
fueled, at least in part, by concern over the future of an industry that has
become the focal point of public scrutiny and government proposals intended,
among other things, to contain the spiralling costs of healthcare in this
country.

  Those transactions involving generic drug companies reflected several
important acknowledgments.  First, the consumer demand for safe and effective
drugs at low

cost is continuing to gain increased support from third party payers, individual
states, municipalities and the federal government, as well as elected officials.
Second, the knowledge and skill required to manufacture generic drugs profitably
is indeed specialized and not easily duplicated. Third, the channels of
distribution will become increasingly important as drug companies strive to
offer broad product lines. Antibiotics will be essential to complete any full
line, affording Biocraft, a leading independent generic manufacturer of
antibiotics, additional opportunity for growth.

  Against the background of industry developments, these factors clearly signify
an important role for Biocraft and a broad range of opportunities in the times
ahead.

Net Sales

  Net sales rose to a record level for the Company in fiscal 1994, increasing by
$30 million (26%) and $28.9 million (34%)in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively, from the corresponding prior periods. The increase in
fiscal 1994 resulted primarily from increased sales volume of Amoxicillin and
Cephalexin products including Amoxicillin chewable tablets introduced by the
Company in fiscal 1993. The increase in fiscal 1993 was primarily attributable
to the introduction by the Company of six new products, especially Ketoprofen
capsules and Amoxicillin chewable tablets. The increases would not have been
achieved without the introduction of new products. Continued increases of this
magnitude are unlikely without further product approvals from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and new drug approvals may be delayed pending resolution of
inspection issues under discussion with the FDA (see Note 11 of notes to
consolidated financial statements).

Gross Profit

  Gross profit margins were 23.4% in fiscal 1994, 21.2% in fiscal 1993 and 11.2%
in fiscal 1992.  The large increase in fiscal 1993, as well as the smaller
increase in fiscal 1994, resulted primarily from  higher gross profit margins
associated with the Company's newly introduced products.  Although the Company
initially obtains higher sales prices for new products, intensified competition
typically forces the Company to lower its sales price and reduce its profit
margin.

Research and Development Expenses

  Research and development expenditures increased by approximately $1.3 million
in fiscal 1994 after decreasing by approximately $100,000 in fiscal 1993
compared to the corresponding prior periods. The increase in fiscal 1994
resulted primarily from increased activity and costs in connection with the
development and approval process for new generic drugs.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $3.3
million in fiscal 1994 and $2 million in fiscal 1993 compared to the
corresponding prior periods.  The decreases were primarily due to decreased
costs in connection with the manufacture of Cefixime (see Other Operating
Income).  Litigation settlements of approximately $400,000 and $800,000 in
fiscal 1994 and 1992, respectively, are included in this item.

Other Operating Income

  Other operating income decreased by approximately $12.8 million in fiscal 1994
after increasing by $5 million in fiscal 1993, compared to the corresponding
prior periods. The changes in both years were due primarily to changes in the
amount of revenues and other reimbursements from American Cyanamid Company
(Cyanamid) under an agreement which provided for the Company's exclusive
manufacturing of Cefixime for Cyanamid at the Company's Fairfield facility.  The
agreement expired on January 31, 1993. Other operating income in fiscal 1993
included a $1.3 million litigation settlement with Merck & Co. (see Note 9 of
notes to consolidated financial statements).

Non-Operating Income and Interest Expense

  Interest, dividend and other non-operating income was approximately the same
in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992.

  Interest expense decreased by approximately $500,000 in fiscal 1994 after
increasing by $1.3 million in fiscal 1993 compared to the corresponding prior
periods.  Most of the Company's interest expense is attributable to the
Company's $30 million bond issued in connection with the Company's facility in
Mexico, Missouri. The increase in fiscal 1993 over 1992 resulted primarily from
the absence of capitalized interest with respect to the bond as a result of the
substantial completion of the Company's facility in Mexico, Missouri. The
decrease in fiscal 1994 was due to reduced rates, during most of the fiscal
year, on the Company's credit facilities, as well as reduced long-term debt. The
Company anticipates a further reduction in its interest expense in the second
half of fiscal 1995 as a result of the refinancing or remarketing of its $30
million bond, scheduled for September 1994.

Provision for Income Taxes

  The Company's effective tax rate/benefit fell to 28% in fiscal 1994, after
falling to 36% in fiscal 1993 from 40% in fiscal 1992. The lower tax rate in
fiscal 1994 resulted primarily from increased research and development credits
as a result of the retroactive reinstatement by Congress of this tax credit. In
addition, adjustments relating to the recent conclusion of tax examinations for
the fiscal years ended in 1987 through 1990 contributed to the lower rate. These
items more than offset the increase in deferred tax liability as a result of the
increase in the statutory tax rate to 35%. In fiscal 1992, the Company incurred
a loss for income tax as well as financial accounting purposes and the Company's
tax exempt income therefore increased rather than decreased its income tax
rate/benefit. In April 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
method increased net earnings by $30,000 or less than $.01 per share for the
1994 fiscal year.

[CHART APPEARS HERE]

Net Earnings (Loss)

For the various reasons noted above, the ratios of net earnings to net sales and
net earnings to operating revenue, decreased from 5.2% and 4.6%, respectively,
in fiscal 1993 to 4.3% (for both ratios) in fiscal 1994. In fiscal 1992 the
Company had a net loss.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

  Net cash provided by earnings before interest, depreciation and taxes was
approximately $20 million in fiscal 1994. Funds were primarily used to finance
increased inventories ($8 million), capital expenditures ($6 million), income
tax payments ($4 million), interest payments ($4 million) and net long-term debt
repayment ($4 million). The Company was a net user of cash from operations
primarily because of the large increase in inventories. Although inventory
levels increased, inventory turnover improved to 2.4 in fiscal 1994 from 2.0 in
fiscal 1993. The increase in inventories was also due in large part to an
increase in products for which the Company is awaiting FDA approval and such
approval may be delayed pending resolution of inspection issues under discussion
with the FDA (see Note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements). In
addition, the Company paid a $1.4 million dividend and reduced its accounts
payable by $3 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents decreased by
approximately $11 million during fiscal 1994. The Company maintained $63 million
of working capital and a current ratio of 4.7:1 as of March 31, 1994, compared
to $61 million of working capital and a current ratio of 3.8:1 as of March 31,
1993.

  The Company had total long-term obligations at March 31, 1994 of $54 million
compared to $57 million at March 31, 1993, and its long-term obligations as a
percentage of total capitalization decreased to 36% at March 31, 1994 compared
to 38% at March 31, 1993.

  Most of the Company's long-term obligations is its 9.125% $30 million bond
issued in September 1989 in connection with the construction of its facility in
Mexico, Missouri. The bonds, due September 1, 2004, were issued by the Missouri
Economic Development, Export and Infrastructure Board and secured by a Letter of
Credit issued by the Bank of Tokyo, Ltd., New York Agency. The Letter of Credit
agreement provides for a mortgage on the Mexico, Missouri facility. Principal
amortization installments are in varying amounts, with an initial payment of
$2.2 million in fiscal 1995. The Company plans to remarket or refinance the
bonds in September 1994 and anticipates reducing its interest expense in the
second half of fiscal 1995 as a result thereof.

Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of
Operations (Continued)

  In addition to the bonds, the Company has a $10 million revolving credit line
($7 million outstanding as of March 31, 1994) with National Westminster Bank NJ
(NatWest), as well as a $3 million unsecured term loan and a $2.7 million
mortgage. The Company also has a $10 million revolving credit line with Commerce
Bank of St. Louis, N.A. (Commerce Bank) of which $3.25 million was outstanding
as of March 31, 1994. Both credit lines are automatically extended for
successive one-year periods unless the bank otherwise notifies the Company at
least two months before the maturity date. In the event a bank elects not to
renew, the Company may convert the revolving credit line into a term loan.

  The credit facilities with NatWest and Commerce Bank, as well as the Letter of
Credit Agreement with Bank of Tokyo require, among other matters, that the
Company meet certain financial covenants. The Company is in compliance with all
required financial covenants.

  The Company's other outstanding long-term obligations include (i) $459,000 in
connection with 15-year New Jersey Economic Development Authority Revenue bonds
issued in December 1983, used to finance the Company's Paterson, New Jersey
plant and which is secured by a mortgage on that plant and the Company's Elmwood
Park plant; (ii) a $250,000 term loan agreement with the Missouri Department of
Economic Development (MODED) and the City of Mexico, payable in 40 equal
quarterly installments of $10,000 beginning September 1, 1990; and (iii) $9
million ($7.4 million present value) due pursuant to a 1990 litigation
settlement agreement. (See Note 5 of notes to consolidated financial
statements).

  The Company currently has no other significant long-term commitments and
anticipates that it can satisfy its operating requirements and capital
expenditure needs from its existing credit facilities as well as from internally
generated funds.

Other
  
  In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities," effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1993. Under the new rules, debt securities that the Company has
both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at
amortized cost. Debt securities that the Company does not have the positive
intent and ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale or trading and carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available-for-
sale are carried as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Unrealized
holding gains and losses on securities classified as trading are reported in
earnings.

  Presently, the Company classifies debt securities as held-for-investment and
carries them at amortized cost.  Other securities are reported at the lower of
cost or market (LOCOM) and net unrealized losses are reported in earnings.  The
Company will apply the new rules starting in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.
Application of the new rules will result in an immaterial increase in
stockholders' equity as of April 1,1994, representing the recognition in
stockholders' equity of unrealized appreciation, net of taxes, on the Company's
investment in debt and equity securities determined to be available-for-sale,
previously carried at amortized cost or at LOCOM.

  In November 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 112, requiring accrual
accounting for certain post employment benefits, such as disabilitiy benefits.
The Company does not provide such post employment benefits.

  There were 908 holders of record of the Company's Common Stock on June 10,
1994.

  On August 16, 1993 the Company declared its fifth consecutive annual cash
dividend of $.10 per share on its Common Stock, which was paid on November 18,
1993. The Company's fourth annual dividend of $.10 per share on its common stock
was paid on November 18, 1992. The payment of cash dividends is subject to the
discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon many factors,
including the Company's earnings, its capital needs and its general financial
condition.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  (a)  Principles of Consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Biocraft
Laboratories, Inc.  (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific
American Insurance Company (PAIC).

  The equity method of accounting is used for the Company's investment in
Delmarva Laboratories, Inc. (Delmarva), a distributor of veterinary
pharmaceutical products, including products produced by the Company. The Company
owns a 25% interest in Delmarva, which is included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

  (b) Inventories

  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last-in, first-out (LIFO)) or
market and include appropriate elements of material, labor and manufacturing
overhead.

  (c) Depreciation and Amortization

  Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are provided for under
the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows:

<TABLE>
     <S>                                           <C> 
     Buildings and improvements..................  15 to 40 years

     Machinery and equipment.....................   3 to 10 years
                                                    -------------
</TABLE> 

  Expenditures for major renewals and betterments to property and equipment are
capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
operations as incurred.  When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their
cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts.  Any
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.

  (d) Income Taxes

  Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (Statement 109). Under Statement 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse. As permitted by Statement 109, the Company elected not to
restate the financial statements of any prior years. The cumulative effect of
the change in accounting method increased net earnings by $30,000 or less than
$.01 per share for the 1994 fiscal year.

  (e) Trade Receivables

  Trade Receivables for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1994 and 1993 are shown
net of an allowance for bad debts of $240,000 and $230,000, respectively.

  (f) Concentration of Credit Risk

  The Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of generic pharmaceutical
products.  The Company's manufacturing plants are located in New Jersey and
Missouri.  Its products are sold throughout the United States.  The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers' financial condition and,
generally, requires no collateral from its customers.

  (g) Earnings (Loss) Per Share

  Earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares, as well as common share equivalents (stock options) to the extent
dilutive, outstanding during the year.

  (h)  Reclassifications

  Certain 1993 and 1992 items have been reclassified to conform with 1994
classifications.

2) Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

  Cash equivalents consist of those securities with maturities of three months
or less when purchased. Marketable securities are stated at the lower of cost or
market value. Interest and dividend income realized from the aggregate of such
investments was approximately $500,000 during each of fiscal 1994, 1993 and
1992.

  In May 1993 the FASB issued Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  This Statement, which is required
to be adopted in fiscal 1995 and reflected prospectively, requires that, except
for debt securities classified as "held to maturity," investments in debt and
equity securities be reported at fair value.  Changes in unrealized gains and
losses for securities classified as "available for sale" are recorded directly
to stockholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes.  The adoption of this
Statement is expected to result in an immaterial increase in stockholder's
equity as of April 1, 1994.

  3) Inventories

  Inventories at March 31 consisted of:

  As noted above, at March 31, 1994 and 1993, the LIFO cost of inventories
exceeded current cost by approximately $2.6 million and $1.2 million,
respectively.  Allocation of the LIFO reserve among the components of inventory
is impractical.  As of March 31, 1994 and 1993, inventories include
approximately $4.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of inventory costs,
principally raw materials, relating to products for which the Company is
awaiting regulatory approval.

</TABLE>

  In November 1992, the Company secured a $3.6 million five year term loan from
National Westminster Bank NJ (NatWest), which is secured by a mortgage on the
Company's Fair Lawn, New Jersey property and its warehouse in Waldwick, New
Jersey.  Principal on the mortgage is payable in 20 equal quarterly installments
of $180,000 which commenced in February, 1993.

  In March 1992, the Company secured a $10 million revolving credit line and a
$5 million five year term loan from NatWest. Under the credit line, as amended
and extended, NatWest agreed to advance up to $10 million through September
1995, which period, at the option of the Company provided it is then in
compliance with the terms of the credit agreement, is automatically extended for
successive one-year periods unless NatWest otherwise notifies the Company at
least two months before the maturity date. In the event NatWest elects not to
renew, the Company may, provided it is then in compliance with the terms of the
credit agreement, convert the revolving credit line into a two year term loan
payable in eight equal quarterly installments beginning on the first day of the
fourth succeeding month. Principal on the term loan is payable in 20 equal
quarterly installments of $250,000 which began on May 15, 1992.

  Interest on the NatWest credit line as well as the term loans is based on
market indices selected by the Company. As of March 31, 1994, the Company had
outstanding $7 million under the credit line at a rate of 4.46%, the rate on the
mortgage was 4.34%, and the rate on the term loan was 4.40% (all of which are
.9% above NatWest's cost of funds at the time of borrowing).

  The Company also has a revolving credit line from Commerce Bank of St. Louis,
N.A. (Commerce Bank).  Under the credit line, as amended and extended, Commerce
Bank agreed to advance up to $10 million through September 1995. Interest on the
loan is based on market indices selected by the Company when it borrows under
the credit line.  As of March, 31, 1994, the Company had outstanding $3.25
million at an interest rate of 3.50% with respect to $1.75 million and 4.43%
(.8% above LIBOR) with respect to $1.5 million.

  Both unused lines of credit are subject to a bank commitment fee in an amount
equal to .25% per annum.

  In September 1989, the Company completed a $30 million financing for its
Mexico, Missouri facility. The project was funded primarily from the proceeds of
bonds due in September 2004 issued by the Missouri Economic Development, Export
and Infrastructure Board and secured by a Letter of Credit issued by the Bank of
Tokyo, Ltd., New York Agency. The Letter of Credit agreement provides for a
mortgage on the Mexico, Missouri facility. The bonds bear interest at a rate
equal to 9.125% per annum for a five-year period and thereafter at the Company's
election, from time to time, at a variable or fixed rate. In addition, the
Company pays an annual fee of approximately .80% per annum for the letter of
credit. Principal amortization installments are in varying amounts commencing in
fiscal 1995.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

  The credit facilities with NatWest and Commerce Bank, as well as the Letter of
Credit Agreement with Bank of Tokyo require, among other matters, that the
Company meet certain financial covenants.  The Company is in compliance with all
such covenants.

  In May 1990, the Company entered into a $400,000 term loan agreement with the
Missouri Department of Economic Development (MODED) and the City of Mexico.
This loan is payable in 40 equal quarterly installments of $10,000 beginning
September 1, 1990. Such term loan bears simple interest equal to $20,000 in the
aggregate over the term of the loan, payable in 10 equal installments. The loan
requires the Company to create a certain number of new jobs with at least 51% of
all new jobs from families classified as "low and moderate income" in Missouri,
within 24 months of commencement of the operations at the Company's Mexico,
Missouri plant and is collateralized by certain machinery and equipment subject
to the senior security interest in favor of the Bank of Tokyo, Ltd.

  The mortgage obligation due in 1999 relates to proceeds realized from New
Jersey Economic Development Authority Revenue bonds used to finance the
Company's Paterson, New Jersey plant facility which was purchased from its
principal officers/stockholders. Such mortgage is payable in monthly principal
installments of approximately $8,000 to January 1999, plus interest at a rate of
75% of Valley National Bank's prime rate (an interest rate of 4.69% at March 31,
1994). The mortgage obligation is secured by the Company's Elmwood Park and
Paterson facilities. Among other matters, this obligation requires the Company
to satisfy certain financial covenants.

  The net book value of property and equipment pledged at March 31, 1994 under
the aforementioned bond and mortgage obligations aggregated approximately $64
million.

  Long-term bond and bank principal payments, assuming conversion into a term
loan, at maturity, of each revolving credit line, in each of the next five years
ending March 31, 1998, are as follows: 1995-$4,066,000; 1996-$8,467,000;  1997-
$7,068,000; 1998-$4,373,000; and 1999-$2,113,000.

  The Company believes that the fair value of its long-term bond and bank
obligations approximates the carrying value included in the financial
statements.

  Other long-term obligations represent the present value of the remaining
payments due in connection with a litigation settlement reached in March 1990
concerning a patent on a particular form of Cefadroxil Monohydrate.  Required
annual payments are $1.5 million in both fiscal 1995 and 1996, and $3 million in
both fiscal 1997 and 1998.

  Interest paid, net of capitalized interest, in the years ended March 31, 1994,
1993 and 1992 aggregated $3.7 million, $4.1 million and $2.8 million,
respectively. Capitalized interest amounted to approximately $1 million in
fiscal 1992.

6) Transactions with Related Parties

  Certain officers/stockholders of the Company are also principal stockholders
of Groundwater Decontamination Systems, Inc. (GDS). GDS has granted the Company
a non-exclusive license to use certain of GDS's patented processes presently
employed in the Company's decontamination efforts at its Waldwick plant. The
license (terminable by the Company on 45 days' notice) provides for a royalty of
$120,000 increasing annually by the percentage increase in the consumer price
index during the preceding year.

  Royalties paid to GDS and charged to operations for the years ended March 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to  $12,000 , $9,000 and $14,000, respectively.
The balance of royalties under this license have been waived by GDS for each of
these years.

  Certain officers/stockholders are the principal stockholders of HS Realty
Company, Inc. (HS Realty), a company that owns property adjacent to the
Company's Waldwick plant.  The Company has agreed with HS Realty to extend to
such property the groundwater decontamination work currently being done at the
Waldwick plant.  The agreement also provides that the Company will be entitled
to recover its expenses of performing such work from the profits, if any, from
the future sale or lease of the property.

  The Company has a five-year employment agreement with its President, who is
also a principal stockholder, which expires in March 1995. The agreement
provides for annual compensation at the rate of $500,000 per annum during the
first year of the term, increasing annually thereafter by the greater of 10% or
the percentage increase in the consumer price index during the preceding year.
The President agreed to waive any increase in compensation for each year of his
employment agreement.

  The Company owns a 25% interest in Delmarva, a distributor of veterinary
pharmaceutical products (see Note 1). During fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, the
Company recognized income of $39,000, a loss of $23,000 and income of $16,000,
respectively, its proportionate share of Delmarva's net income or loss.  The
Company also had approximately $4.5 million,  $2.3 million and $1.8 million of
sales to Delmarva and earned exclusive distribution fees from Delmarva of
approximately  $121,000, $111,000 and  $113,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

                       Celebrating 30 Years Of Service
 
  As of March 31,1994 and 1993, accounts receivable from Delmarva totalled
$662,000 and $775,000, respectively.

  A member of the Company's Board of Directors serves as President of B.V.
Chemie Pharmacie Holland (C.P.H.). The Company purchased from or through such
firm bulk pharmaceutical chemicals for approximately $8.4 million, $10.6 million
and $4.0 million in the fiscal years ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. In addition, in the year ended March 31, 1992, the Company sold
approximately $200,000 of bulk pharmaceuticals to Chemie.

7) Income Taxes

  The Company adopted Statement 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," as of April
1, 1993, which changes its method of accounting for income taxes from the
deferred method (Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 - APB 11) to an
asset and liability approach. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting
method on net income was a credit of $30,000 (less than $.01 per share) and was
reflected as of April 1, 1993. Income taxes for fiscal 1993 and 1992 are
measured under APB 11.

  Statement 109 requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences.
Such temporary differences exist when the tax basis differs from the financial
reporting amount of assets or liabilities.  All tax liabilities and tax assets
are measured using current tax law and applicable rates.

  Statement 109 further requires adjustment of tax balances to reflect enacted
changes in tax law or rates in the period of enactment.  Accordingly, fiscal
1994 results include increased tax expense resulting from the enactment of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Tax Act) in August.  The Tax Act
increased the statutory corporate income tax rate one percent (to 35 percent)
and made other changes including a retroactive reinstatement of the research and
development credit.

sources of deferred taxes for the years ended March 31, 1993 and 1992 were:
litigation settlements (additional taxable income of $800,000 in 1993 and $1
million in 1992); depreciation (lower taxable income of $7 million in 1993 and
$4 million in 1992); a $3 million net operating loss arising in 1992 and used to
reduce deferred taxes in 1992, which deferred taxes were substantially restored
in 1993; a tax

credit carryforward of $70,000 in 1993 and $200,000 in 1992; and
an alternative minimum tax liability of $2 million in 1993.  In addition, a
state tax benefit of approximately $600,000 was applied as a reduction of
deferred taxes in 1992.  Income tax benefits related to employee and director
stock plans credited directly to stockholders' equity totalled $105,000 and
$63,000 in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  Income taxes paid in the years ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 aggregated
approximately $4.4 million, $950,000 and $325,000, respectively.

8) Common Stock, Profit-sharing and Pension Plans

  In January 1985, the Company adopted an incentive stock option plan (option
plan) and a restricted stock purchase plan (purchase plan) pursuant to which
300,000 shares of common stock under each plan have been reserved for issuance
to eligible employees.  The exercise price of a stock option under the option
plan shall not be less than the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of grant, unless designated as a non-qualified stock option by the Board of
Directors; the purchase price under the purchase plan may not be less than 10%
of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant.

  Option transactions during the fiscal years ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and
1992 are shown below:

</TABLE>

  During fiscal 1994 and 1993, options were granted at an exercise price of
$5.00 per share. Options were exercised in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 at an
average exercise price of $4.50, $4.26 and $7.65 per share, respectively. The
options forfeited had an average per share exercise price of $5.00 and $3.86 in
fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  Amortization of deferred compensation related to such options charged to
operations in the years ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $ 325,000,
$137,000 and $54,000, respectively.

  At March 31, 1994, an aggregate of approximately 112,000 shares of the
Company's common stock was issued under the purchase plan, including
approximately 9,000 shares issued during 1994, at a price of $2.00 per share.
The Company subsequently repurchased 375 shares at a cost of $ 2.00 per share in
fiscal 1994. The difference between the fair market value and the purchase price
of shares purchased under the purchase plan is charged to operations over the
vesting periods. Amortization of such deferred compensation charged to
operations in the years ended March 31, 1994 and 1992 was $78,000 and $34,000,
respectively.

  In fiscal 1990, the Company adopted the Directors' Stock Option Plan
(directors' plan) pursuant to which 150,000 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance to directors of the Company who are not Company employees
at an option price equal to the value of such shares on the date of grant.
During fiscal 1994, a total of 8,000 options were exercised by directors at an
exercise price of $15.50 per share. As of March 31, 1994, options to purchase
17,000 shares under the directors' plan were outstanding, of which options to
purchase 10,000 shares were currently exercisable at option prices ranging from
approximately $15 to $18 per share.

  The Company has a qualified profit-sharing plan covering eligible non-union
employees except certain employees hired in Missouri. The plan provides for an
annual contribution as determined by the Company; such contribution is not to
exceed the amount deductible as expense in accordance with the Internal Revenue
Code. Profit-sharing plan contributions charged to operations for the years
ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to approximately $1.3 million, $1.1
million and $1.0 million, respectively.

  In October 1987, the Company adopted the Employee Money Purchase Pension Plan
which provides for a mandatory employer contribution of 3% of annual
compensation, excluding bonuses and overtime.  Contributions to such plan
charged to operations for the years ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted
to approximately $ 384,000, $316,000, and $280,000, respectively.  At the same
time, the Company also adopted the 401(k) Savings Plan which provides for
voluntary employee salary deferrals.  Employer matching of $.50 for each dollar
contributed up to a maximum match of 2% of compensation is provided for those
employees who do not participate in the profit-sharing plan.  Matching
contributions to the 401(k) Plan charged to operations amounted to $34,000,
$20,000 and $18,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Both plans are
provided for non-union employees.

<PAGE>
                       Celebrating 30 Years of Service
 
  Pension contributions to a multi-employer plan in accordance with various
union agreements were $351,000, $370,000 and $393,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

  In November 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 112, requiring accrual
accounting for certain post-employment benefits, such as disability benefits.
The Company does not provide such post-employment benefits.

9) Litigation Settlement

  In February 1986, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. (Roche) obtained a declaratory
judgment that the Company was not entitled to withhold royalties under a license
for the right to manufacture and sell a patented drug, which patent expired in
June 1988. In February 1994 this matter was settled by the Company and the case
was dismissed. The Company paid Roche $250,000.

  In May 1992, the Company settled a litigation with two former sales
representatives.  Without any admission of liability, the Company agreed to pay
$175,000, which amount, together with related legal fees, was expensed in the
fiscal year ended March 31,1992.

  In May 1992 the Company settled its litigation with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck)
regarding Merck's patent for Amiloride Hydrochloride with Hydrochlorothiazide,
which patent was found invalid.  The parties agreed to the dismissal of the
Company's claim for damages and to release each other from all claims arising
from the litigation and Merck paid the Company $1.3 million, which amount was
included in the Company's other operating income in fiscal 1993.  There was no
admission of liability by Merck.

10) Segment Information and Other Matters

  The Company operates in one industry segment (generic pharmaceutical
products). Although the Company's net sales included both finished dosage form
products and bulk material, sales of bulk material constituted less than 1% of
the Company's total sales for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 1994,
1993 and 1992. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the
fiscal years ended in 1994, 1993 and 1992.

11) Contingencies

  At March 31, 1994, the Company was involved in certain litigation and other
claims related to its operations.

  In September 1980, the Company entered into an administrative consent order
with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to
which the Company agreed to among other things, monitor and take certain action
to remediate contamination of the groundwater beneath the Company's Waldwick,
New Jersey plant by use of microbiological decontamination wells which were
installed in fiscal 1981. This order has been modified to include action to be
taken to monitor and, if necessary, remediate possible contamination of the
groundwater below the property adjacent to the Waldwick facility. The Company
does not expect the continued cost of this remediation to be material.

  On June 8, 1989, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
notified the company that it was a potentially responsible party (PRP) along
with other generators of industrial waste, the site owners and operators, and
transporters of wastes to the site, for the alleged releases of hazardous
substances from a waste management site in Elkton, Maryland, known as the
"Spectron Site." The Company has participated with other PRPs in investigating
and remediating the site under a Consent Order entered into with EPA in August
1989. As of March 31, 1994, the Company has paid approximately $224,000 to the
PRP group, all of which was paid prior to fiscal 1994, for its share of clean-up
costs, based on volumetric allocation of waste shipments to the Spectron Site.
On March 19, 1990, EPA sent another letter to the Company notifying it of
potential liability for planned additional remedial work at the Spectron site.
The additional remedial work arises from alleged releases of hazardous
substances at the Spectron site during the period of 1968 to 1982, known as the
Galaxy period. The Company has decided to join with other PRPs in the
negotiation of a Consent Order with EPA for the additional remedial work related
to the Galaxy period.

  The Company is one of over 400 defendants in an action entitled "Transtech
Industries, Inc. et al v. A & Z Septic Clean, et al" pending in the federal
district court for New Jersey, regarding hazardous waste allegedly shipped to
the Kin-Buc Landfill in New Jersey; has been notified by the North Carolina
Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources that it believes that
the Company was one of approximately 1,500 entities that caused hazardous
material to be shipped to a waste treatment facility previously operated by the
Seaboard Chemical Corporation at Jamestown, North Carolina; and is one of more
than 900 entities notified that it has shipped hazardous waste to a site in
Caldwell County, North Carolina.  It is not possible to predict with any level
of certainty the Company's potential exposure with respect to the aforementioned
matters.  However, considering the number of potentially responsible parties,
many of which are substantial corporations, and the Company's small proportion
of the total volume of waste sent to the sites in question, the

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  

Company believes that its portion of such liability, if any (including any site
clean-up costs), is not likely to be material to the Company.

  In November 1993, a class action was commenced in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain officers of
the Company.  The action purports to allege securities fraud and common law
claims on behalf of purchasers of the Company's stock, based on alleged
misrepresentations and omissions in the Company's publicly filed statements and
press releases regarding the Company's compliance with FDA concerning the
Company's manufacture of its products.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and
punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as well as attorney's fees and other
costs of the lawsuit.  On May 9, 1994, the Company moved to dismiss the
complaint on the grounds that, among other things, it fails to state a claim
upon which relief can be granted.

  The Company is in discussions with the FDA over issues arising from an
inspection in May 1994.  The FDA has requested that the Company take additional
steps to remedy alleged noncompliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices
(cGMPs), primarily as they relate to certain of the Company's products.  The
Company believes that its marketed products meet appropriate standards and are
safe and effective, and that it is in substantial compliance with current cGMPs.
Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of these discussions and no
assurances can be made, it is hopeful that a mutually acceptable resolution can
be reached with the FDA without litigation.

  In addition, the Company is also a party to other litigation incidental to its
business.  In management's opinion, after consulting legal counsel, it is
unlikely that the ultimate resolution of such litigation and the matters
discussed above will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position.

Independent Auditors' Report

Ernst & Young

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Biocraft
Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiary as of March 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. The financial statements
of Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 1992, were audited
by other auditors whose report dated June 15, 1992 (except as to note 5, which
was as of June 22, 1992) expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the 1994 and 1993 financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiary at March 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

  As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective April 1, 1993,
the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

                         Independent Auditors' Report
                         ----------------------------

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows of Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. and
subsidiary for the year ended March 31, 1992. In connection with our audit of
the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial
statement Schedules V, VI and VIII for the year ended March 31, 1992. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statement and financial statement
schedules based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the results of the operations and the cash 
flows of Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiary for the year ended March 31,
1992 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our 
opinion, the related 1992 financial statement schedules, when considered in 
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, 
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
