Competition

    Standex manufactures and markets products many of which have achieved a
unique or leadership position in their market.  However, the Company
encounters competition in varying degrees in all product groups and for each
product line.  Competitors include domestic and foreign producers of the same
and similar products.  The principal methods of competition are price,
delivery schedule, quality of services, product performance and other terms
and conditions of sale.  During fiscal 1994, the Company invested $13,238,000
in new plant and equipment in order to upgrade facilities to become more
competitive in all segments.

International Operations

    Substantially all international operations of the Company are related to
domestic operations and are included in all three product groups.
International operations are conducted at 34 plants, principally in Western
Europe.  The industry segment information regarding non-U.S. operations on
page 20 of the 1994 Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.  


Research and Development

    Due to the nature of the manufacturing operations of Standex and the types
of products manufactured, expenditures for research and development are not
material to any segment.
    

Environmental and Other Matters

    To the best of its knowledge, the Company believes that it is presently in
substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and
does not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on its
future capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.


                              ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES


    At June 30, 1994, Standex operated a total of 86 principal plants and

sections of the United States, of which 17 were leased.  The approximate
building space utilized by each product group of Standex at June 30, 1994 is

         request in writing of either a majority of the directors or 
         the holders of a majority of the capital stock of the 
         Corporation then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.  
         Any such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the 
         proposed meeting.  The business transacted at any special 
         meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purpose or 
         purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.

         expressly required by law, notice of each meeting of 
         stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given, not

         personally, or by mailing such notice in a postage prepaid 
         envelope directed to him at his address as it appears on the 
         books of the Corporation, unless he shall have filed with the 
         Secretary a written request that notices intended for him be 
         sent to him at the address designated in such request.  Notice 
         shall be in writing and shall state the time when and the 
         place where it is to be held.  In the case of special 
         meetings, the notice shall also indicate that it is being 
         issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling 
         the meeting and shall state the purpose or purposes for which 
         the meeting is called.  Notice of any adjourned meeting of 
         stockholders shall not be required to be given except where 
         expressly required by law or as required by Section 6 of this 
         Article II.
         
              Section 4.   Place, Date and Time of Meeting.  Meetings 
         of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be held at such 
         place, date and time as may be fixed by the Board of 
         Directors.  If the Board shall not fix a place for such 
         meetings, they shall be held at the principal executive 
         offices of the Corporation in Salem, New Hampshire.
         
              Section 5.   List of Stockholders.  The officer who has 
         charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare 
         and make, at least ten days before every meeting of 
         stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to 
         vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and 
         showing the address of each stockholder and the number of 
         shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list 
         shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any 
         purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business 
         hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, 
         either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be 
         held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the 
         meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the 
         meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be produced and 
         kept at the time and place of the meeting during the meeting, 
         and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
         
              Section 6.   Quorum; Adjournments.  Except as otherwise 
         provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, 
         the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding 
         and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders present in 
         person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for 
         the transaction of business.  If however, such quorum shall 
         not be present at any meeting of stockholders, the 
         stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or 
         represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting 
         from time to time, without notice other than announcement at 
         the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.  
         At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present 
         or represented, any business may be transacted which might 
         have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  
         If the adjournment is for more than thirty days or, if after 
         the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned 
         meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to 
         each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
         
              Section 7.   Voting; Proxies.  When a quorum is obtained 
         at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the 
         capital stock having voting power present in person or 
         represented by proxy shall decide any matters brought before 
         such meeting, unless the matter is one upon which, by express 
         provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a 
         different vote is required, in which case such express 
         provision shall govern and control the decision of such 
         matter.  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of 
         Incorporation, each stockholder shall, at every meeting of 
         stockholders, be entitled to one vote for each share of the 
         capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder and 
         present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting.  No 
         proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless 
         the proxy provides for a longer period.  In each election of 
         directors, the candidates receiving the highest number of 
         votes, up to the number of directors to be elected in such 
         election, shall be elected.
         
              Section 8.   Organization of Meetings.  At every meeting 
         of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board, or in the absence 
         of the Chairman of the Board, the President or in the absence 
         of both the Chairman of the Board and the President, a Vice 
         President, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the 
         President and all the Vice Presidents, a chairman chosen by 
         the stockholders, shall act as chairman; and the Secretary, or 
         in his absence, a person appointed by the chairman, shall act 
         as secretary.
         
              Section 9.   Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting.  
         Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, 
         any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or 
         special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, may be 
         taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a 
         vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so 
         taken shall be signed by the holders of all the outstanding 
         stock of the Corporation.
         
                                  ARTICLE III
         
                                   DIRECTORS
         
              Section 1.   Number and Term of Office.  The Board of 
         Directors shall be composed of not less than seven nor more 
         than fifteen directors, as fixed by the stockholders from time 
         to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
         the next paragraph or elsewhere in these By-Laws, no change in 
         the number of directors shall result in the removal of any 
         director prior to the expiration of his term of office or the 
         reduction of his term of office.  The directors shall be 
         elected at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, except as 
         provided in Section 3 of this Article III. Directors need not 
         be stockholders.
         
              The directors shall be divided into three classes: Class 
         I, Class II, and Class III.  Such classes shall be as nearly 
         equal in number as possible.  The term of office of the Class 
         I directors shall expire at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
         in 1981; the term of office of the Class II directors shall 
         expire at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 1980; the term 
         of office of the Class III directors will expire at the Annual 
         Meeting of Stockholders in 1979; or in each case thereafter 
         when their respective successors are elected and have 
         qualified or upon their earlier death, resignation or removal.  
         At each annual election held after classification and the 
         initial election of directors according to classes, the 
         directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire 
         shall be identified as being of the same class as the 
         directors they succeed and shall be elected for a term 
         expiring at the third succeeding Annual Meeting of 
         Stockholders or in each case thereafter when their respective 
         successors are elected and have qualified or upon their 
         earlier death, resignation or removal.  If the number of 
         directors is changed, any increase or decrease in directors 
         shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain all 
         classes as nearly equal in number as possible and any 
         individual director elected to any such class shall hold 
         office for a term which shall coincide with the term of such 
         class.
         
              Section 2.   Resignations; Removals.  Any director may 
         resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board of 
         Directors, to the Chief Executive Officer or to the Secretary.  
         Any such resignation shall take effect at the date of the 
         receipt of such notice or at any later time specified therein, 
         and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of 
         such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.  
         A director may be removed from office only for cause, by vote 
         of the stockholders or by action of the Board.
         
              Section 3.   Vacancies.  Vacancies and newly created 
         directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized 
         number of directors may be filled by a majority of the 
         directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a 
         sole remaining director, and any director so chosen shall hold 
         office until the next election of the class for which such 
         director shall have been chosen, and until his successor is 
         duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, 
         resignation or removal.  If there are no directors in office, 
         then an election of directors may be held in the manner 
         provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or 
         any newly created directorship, the directors then in office 
         shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as 
         constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court 
         of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or 
         stockholders holding at least ten percent of the total number 
         of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for 
         such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill 
         any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to 
         replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office.
         
              Section 4.   Power to Manage Business.  The business and 
         affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the 
         direction of, its Board of Directors which may exercise all 
         such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and 
         things as are not, by statute or by the Certificate of 
         Incorporation or by these By-Laws, directed or required to be 
         exercised or done by the stockholders.
         
              Section 5.   Annual Meeting.  Immediately after each 
         annual election of directors, the Board of Directors shall 
         meet for the purpose of organization, election of officers and 
         the transaction of other business, at the place where such 
         election of directors was held.  Notice of such meeting need 
         not be given.  In the absence of a quorum at said meeting, the 
         same may be held at any other time or place which shall be 
         specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for 
         special meetings of the Board of Directors.
         
              Section 6.   Regular Meeting.  Regular meetings of the 
         Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and 
         place as shall from time to time be determined by standing 
         resolution of the Board.
         
              Section 7.   Special Meetings; Notice.  Special meetings 
         of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the 
         Board, by the President, or by two or more of the Directors, 
         and shall be held at such time and place as shall be given by 
         mail, telegram, telephone or orally, by or at the direction of 
         the person or persons authorized to call such meeting, to each 
         Director, not later than the day before the day on which the 
         meeting is to be held.
         
              Section 8.   Organization of Meetings.  At every meeting 
         of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, if one 
         has been selected and is present, or in the absence of the 
         Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, or in 
         the absence of the Chairman of the Board and the Vice Chairman 
         of the Board, the President, or in the absence of the Chairman 
         of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board and the 
         President, a chairman chosen by a majority of the Directors 
         present, shall preside; and the Secretary or, in his absence, 
         a person appointed by the chairman, shall act as secretary.
         
              Section 9.   Quorum; Voting; Adjournments.  A majority of 
         the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the 
         transaction of business and, except as otherwise specifically 
         provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote 
         of a majority of the  directors present at any meeting at 
         which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of 
         Directors.  In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, 
         the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from 
         time to time, without notice other than announcement at the 
         meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
         
              Section 10.  Committees.  The Board of Directors may, by 
         resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate 
         one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or 
         more of the directors of the Corporation.  The Board may 
         designate one or more directors as alternate members of any 
         committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member 
         at any meeting of the committee.  In the absence or 
         disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or 
         members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified 
         from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, 
         may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of 
         Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such 
         absent or disqualified member.
         
              Any such committee, to the extent provided in the 
         resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may 
         exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of 
         Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the 
         Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to 
         be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such 
         committee shall have the power or authority in reference to 
         amending the Certificate of Incorporation, adopting an 
         agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the 
         stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or 
         substantially all of the property and assets of the 
         Corporation, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of 
         the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending 
         the By-Laws of the Corporation; and unless the resolution or 
         the Certificate of Incorporation expressly so provides, no 
         such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a 
         dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock or to adopt a 
         certificate of ownership and merger.  Such committee or 
         committees shall have such name or names as may be determined 
         from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of 
         Directors.  Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its 
         meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when 
         required.
         
              Section 11.  Action Without a Meeting.  Any action 
         required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board 
         of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without 
         a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the 
         case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or 
         writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the 
         Board or committee.
         
              Section 12.  Participation in Meetings.  Members of the 
         Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may participate 
         in a meeting of the Board or committee by means of conference 
         telephone or similar communications equipment by means of 
         which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each 
         other.  Such participation in a meeting shall constitute 
         presence in person at such meeting.
         
              Section 13.  Compensation of Directors.  Each director 
         shall be entitled to receive such compensation, if any, as may 
         from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors, 
         including a fee, if any is so fixed, for each meeting of the 
         Board or any committee thereof, regular or special, attended 
         by him.  Directors may also be reimbursed by the Corporation

              Section 4.   Registered Stockholders.  The Corporation

         designated shall be valid unless countersigned by such 
         Transfer Agent and registered by such Registrar.  The Board 
         may also make such additional rules and regulations as it may 
         deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration

              Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside 
         out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends 
         such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their 
         absolute discretion, deem proper as a reserve or reserves to 
         meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for 
         repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or 
         for such other purpose as the directors shall deem conducive 
         to the interests of the Corporation, and the directors may

         Directors shall present at each annual meeting of 
         stockholders, and at any special meeting of the stockholders,

         impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
         
              Section 6.   Waiver of Notice.  Whenever notice is 
         required to be given under any provision of Delaware law or by 
         the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, a written waiver 
         thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether

         when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of 
         objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction 
         of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or 
         convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the 
         purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the 
         stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors 
         need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so 
         required by the Certificate of Incorporation.

         the Board of Directors at any regular meeting, or at any 
         special meeting if notice of such alteration, amendment,

by the surrender of the cash dividend, the Employee shall submit a 
personal check for the difference between the amount of the cash 
dividend and the interest then due.  The Company may postpone the date

representing the Shares in the name of the Employee or, upon written 
request by the Employee, in the joint names of the employee and his 
spouse.

(b) Pledge of Shares.  The Employee shall pledge and assign all of the 
Shares to the Company as collateral security for payment of the 
principal of and interest on the Loan unless the Company determines 
that a lesser number of shares will give it adequate security.  In 
order to implement this pledge, the Employee shall deliver to the 
Company a duly executed stock power authorizing the transfer of the 
Shares endorsed in blank by the Employee or, if necessary, jointly by 
the Employee and his spouse.

(c) Additional Shares.  Any new, additional or substituted shares

reclassification, merger, reorganization or otherwise, shall be held 
by the Company as additional collateral security for the Loan and 
shall be subject in all respects to this Agreement unless the Company 
determines that it has adequate security for the Loan.

(d) Voting of Shares.  Unless and until a default is declared by the 
Company under this Agreement, the Employee shall be entitled to vote

Employee shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber, grant any 
option with respect to, or otherwise dispose of the Shares.

same shall become due and payable, the Company shall have the right to

unpaid balance of the Loan shall become immediately due and payable.

sale or at public auction, with or without demand, advertisement or 
notice of the time or place of sale, for cash, on credit or for other 
property, for immediate or future delivery, and for such price or 
prices and on such terms as the Company in its sole discretion may 
determine.  The Company may purchase for its own account the whole or 
any part of the Shares.  Any purchaser shall acquire good title to the 
Shares free of the lien of this Agreement and free of any right or 
equity of redemption.  The net proceeds of any such sale shall be 
applied first to the payment of the full amount of principal and 
interest then due under the Loan, and second to the payment to the 
Employee of any excess proceeds, together with any of the Shares 
remaining unsold.

         2.   PRE-RETIREMENT_BENEFITS 
         
              In the event of the death of an Executive while employed 
         by the Corporation, the Beneficiary shall be entitled to 
         receive a death benefit which is calculated by multiplying 
         the Annual Earnings of the Executive by a Death Benefit 
         Factor derived from the following schedule:
         
              Age_of_Executive_at_Death     Death_Benefit Factor 
         
              Less than 45 years                  4.5
              45 to 49 years                      4.0 
              50 to 54 years                      3.5 
              55 and over years                   3.0 
         
              The Annual Earnings of the Executive used in the above 
         calculation shall depend on whether the date of death occurs 
         before March 1st (the effective date for annual changes under 
         the group life insurance contract) of any calendar year or on 
         or after March 1st.  If the date of death is before 
         March 1st in any calendar year, the Annual Earnings used in 
         the calculation shall be the Annual Earnings in the calendar 
         year in which falls the day which is exactly two years prior 
         to the date of death.  If the date of death is on or after 
         March 1st in any calendar year, the Annual Earnings shall be 
         those in the immediately preceding calendar year.
         
              Such pre-retirement death benefit shall be payable 
         pursuant to a group life insurance contract maintained by the 
         Corporation, only if and to the extent that the group life 
         insurance contract provides for such payment, and any balance 
         of the pre-retirement death benefit shall be payable directly 
         by the Corporation and not pursuant to the group life 
         insurance contract.
         
         3.   POST-RETIREMENT_BENEFITS 
         
              In the event that the Executive's employment with the 
         Corporation shall terminate by reason of his retirement as 
         provided in Section 4 hereof, the post-retirement death 
         benefit payable to the Beneficiary in the event of the 
         Executive's subsequent death shall be an amount equal to 
         three times the Executive's Annual Earnings in either the 
         calendar year in which he retires or in the immediately 
         preceding calendar year (whichever year results in the 
         greater Annual Earnings).
         
              The post-retirement death benefit shall be payable 
         pursuant to the group life insurance contract only to the 
         extent that the group life insurance contract provides for 
         such payment.  The balance of the post-retirement death 
         benefit shall be payable directly by the Corporation and not 
         pursuant to the group life insurance contract.
         
              The Corporation may determine that, in lieu of the 
         post-retirement death benefit mentioned in the immediately 
         preceding paragraph, the Executive shall receive supplemental 
         retirement income payable to the Executive in 120 equal 
         monthly installments beginning the month in which the 
         Executive begins to receive his pension under the Standex 
         Retirement Plan.  The total amount of such retirement income 
         shall equal the post-retirement death benefit.  The amount of 
         each monthly installment shall be the post-retirement death 
         benefit divided by 120.  
         
              In the event of the Executive's death while receiving 
         such supplemental retirement income, any unpaid monthly 
         payments shall be paid to the Beneficiary from the 
         Corporation in a lump sum, if the Beneficiary shall have 
         survived the Executive.  If the Beneficiary shall not have 
         survived the Executive, any unpaid monthly payments shall be 
         paid to the estate of the Executive.
         
         4.   RETIREMENT 
         
              For purposes of this Program, retirement shall mean 
         whenever an Executive has terminated employment with the 
         Corporation such that, under the Standex International 
         Corporation Retirement Plan, he is considered as retired and 
         receiving a pension.  In addition, for purposes of this 
         Program, an Employee shall be deemed to have retired in the 
         event of a change in control of the Corporation (which would 
         be required to be reported under Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of 
         Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and 
         the Executive chooses to terminate his employment because of:
         
               (i) a change in the Executives general area of 
                   responsibility, title or place of employment; or
         
              (ii) the Executive's salary or benefits are lessened or 
                   diminished.
         
         5.   LIFE INSURANCE
         
              The Corporation shall pay all premiums for the group 
         life insurance contract mentioned in Sections 2 and 3 hereof.
         
              The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, purchase 
         and be the owner of permanent insurance policies on the life 
         of an Executive.  Any proceeds payable pursuant to such 
         corporate-owned insurance policies shall be payable to the 
         Corporation.  By accepting this Program, the Executive agrees 
         to take any action required to enable the Corporation to 
         purchase and maintain such insurance.
         
         6.   NON-SECURED_PROMISE 
         
              Any asset or investment held by the Corporation in 
         connection with the liabilities assumed by it hereunder shall 
         be a general asset of the Corporation, and shall not be 
         pledged for the payment or to secure any obligation of the 
         Corporation, and the promise to pay any benefit hereunder is 
         a non-secured, general liability of the Corporation.
         
         7.   ASSIGNMENT 
         
              No Executive nor any Beneficiary shall have any right to 
         commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or hypothecate or 
         otherwise convey the right to receive any payment hereunder 
         (whether by operation of law or otherwise) nor shall any such 
         rights be subject to execution, attachment or similar 
         process.  Such payments and the right thereto are expressly 
         declared to be non-assignable and non-transferable.  Any such 
         attempted assignment, transfer, levy of any attachment or 
         similar process shall have no effect or validity.
         
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an 
         Executive shall have any rights under the group life 
         insurance coverage to assign that coverage, such assignment 
         shall be permitted but only in accordance with the terms of 
         the group life insurance contact.
         
         8.   INDEPENDENCE_OF_PROGRAM 
         
              The benefits provided under this Program shall be 
         independent of, and in addition to, any other benefits 
         provided by the Corporation or any compensation payable by 
         the Corporation to the Executive.  This Program shall not be 
         deemed to constitute a contract of service between the 
         Corporation and any Executive, nor shall any provision hereof 
         restrict the right of the Corporation to discharge an 
         Executive or restrict the right of an Executive to terminate 
         his services.
         
         9.   NO VESTING OF BENEFITS
         
              All benefits and all rights of each Executive covered 
         under this Program shall terminate in the event that the 
         Executive's employment with the Corporation shall terminate 
         for any reason other than death or retirement as provided in 
         Section 4.
         
         10.  MODIFICATION_OR_REVOCATION_OF_PROGRAM 
         
              The Corporation reserves the right to modify or revoke 
         this Program in whole or in part at any time, provided that 
         no such modification or revocation shall reduce or terminate 
         any pre-retirement benefits or post-retirement benefits to an 
         Executive or his Beneficiary.
         
         11.  NAMED_FIDUCIARY

            11.02  The Named Fiduciary shall have the authority to 
                   control and manage the operation and administration 
                   of the Program.  However, the Named Fiduciary may 
                   in his discretion allocate his responsibilities for 
                   the operation and administration of the Program, 
                   including the designation of persons who are not 
                   Named Fiduciaries to carry out fiduciary 
                   responsibilities.  The Named Fiduciary shall effect 
                   such allocation of his responsibilities by 
                   delivering to the Corporation a written instrument 
                   signed by him that specifies the nature and extent 
                   of the responsibilities allocated, including, if 
                   appropriate, the persons, not Named Fiduciaries, 
                   who are designated to carry out fiduciary 
                   responsibilities under the Program.
         
            11.03  The Named Fiduciary designated or appointed under 
                   the terms of Paragraph 11.01 above, is hereby 
                   designated as the Plan Administrator of the 
                   Program.
         
         12.  CLAIMS_PROCEDURE 
         
              The following Claims Procedure shall control the 
         determination of benefit payments under this Program:
         
            12.01  Filing of a Claim for Benefits 
         
              	   If the Executive or his Beneficiary believes he is 
                   entitled to receive benefits under the Program, he 
                   must submit a written claim for benefits, on a form 
                   supplied by said Fiduciary, to the Named Fiduciary.  
                   The Named Fiduciary's independent decision on the 
                   claimant's claim for benefits shall be 
                   determinative of whether or not the Executive or 
                   his Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive 
                   benefits under this Program.
         
            12.02  Denial of Claim
         
              	   A claim for benefits under the Program will be 
                   denied if the Named Fiduciary determines that the 
                   claimant is not entitled to receive benefits under 
                   the Program.  Notice of a denial shall be furnished 
                   to the claimant within a reasonable period of time 
                   after receipt of the claim for benefits by the 
                   Named Fiduciary.
         
            12.03  Content of Notice
         
                   The Named Fiduciary shall provide to every claimant 
                   who is denied a claim for benefits written notice 
                   setting forth, in a manner reasonably calculated to 
                   be understood by the claimant, the following:
         
         	    (i)	The specific reason or reasons for the denial;
         
         	   (ii)	Specific reference to pertinent Program 
                        provisions on which the denial is based; 
         
         	  (iii)	A description of any additional material or 
                        information necessary to the claimant to 
                        perfect the claim, and an explanation of why 
                        such material or information is necessary; and
         
         	   (iv)	An explanation of the Program's Claim Review 
                        Procedure as set forth below.
         
            12.04  Review Procedure
         
              	   The purpose of this Review Procedure is to provide 
                   a method by which a claimant may have a reasonable 
                   opportunity to appeal a denial of a claim to the 
                   Named Fiduciary for a full and fair review.  To 
                   accomplish that purpose, the claimant or his duly 
                   authorized representative:
         
         	    (i)	May request a review upon written application 
                        to the Named Fiduciary;
         
         	   (ii)	May review pertinent Program documents; and
         
         	  (iii)	May submit issues and comments in writing.
         
              	   A claimant (or his duly authorized representative) 
                   shall request a review by filing a written 
                   application for review with the Named Fiduciary at 
                   any time within 60 days after receipt by the 
                   claimant of written notice of the denial of his 
                   claim.
         
            12.05  Decision on Review
         
              	   A decision on review of a denied claim shall be 
                   made in the following manner:
         
         	    (i)	The decision on review shall be made by the 
                        Salary and Employee Benefits Committee of the 
                        Board of Directors of the Corporation, which 
                        may in its discretion hold a hearing on the 
                        denied claim.  Such decision shall be made 
                        promptly, and not later than 60 days after 
                        receipt of the request for review, unless 
                        special circumstances (such as the need to 
                        hold a hearing) require an extension of time 
                        for processing, in which case a decision shall 
                        be rendered as soon as possible, but not later 
                        than 120 days after receipt of the request for 
                        review.
         
         	   (ii)	The decision on review shall be in writing and 
                        shall include specific reasons for the 
                        decision, written in a manner reasonably 
                        calculated to be understood by the claimant, 
                        and specific references to the pertinent

         3.01   Insurance Policy.

         The Company has purchased or will purchase a Policy from the

              (2)  The Company shall, to the extent that the Policy

              (3)  The Participant's Beneficiary, as provided in the
                   applicable Designation of Beneficiary Form shall, to
                   the extent that the Policy proceeds have not be
                   exhausted, next be paid an amount equal to three times
                   the Participant's Compensation in the calendar year
                   immediately preceding the year in which his or her
                   death occurs; and

              (4)  The Company shall receive the balance, if any, of the
                   death benefit remaining after the payments provided
                   for above. 

         (b)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, in the event
              that, for any reason whatsoever, no death benefit is
              payable under the Policy upon the death of the Participant
              but, in lieu thereof, the Insurer refunds all or any part
              of the premiums paid for the Policy, the Company and the
              Participant's Beneficiary shall share such premiums based
              on their respective cumulative payments toward those
              premiums.                


         3.04   Designation of Beneficiary.

         The Participant may select one or more Beneficiaries to receive

         hereto as Exhibit B and by delivering the form to the Company.

         pay the full amount of the premium to the Insurer and shall,
         upon request, promptly furnish the Participant evidence of
         timely payment of such premium.  

         On or about December 15th in each year prior to Retirement, each
         Participant will contribute to the cost of maintaining the
         Policy or Policies on his or her life by paying to the Company
         an amount equal to the economic benefit (based on the lowest
         term life insurance rates of the Insurer) of the life insurance
         coverage provided by the Policy or Policies.  On or about
         December 1st in each year, the Company shall furnish to the

         coverage.

         Vested Amount.

         A Participant who Retires from employment with the Company
         shall, to the extent he or she is vested on his or her
         retirement date, be continued to be covered by the Policy for
         the balance of his or her life as long as he or she has not
         begun to receive the Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit
         specified in Article 4.  Upon the death of a Retired Participant
         the total amount provided as a death benefit under the Policy
         shall be paid in the order of priority and in the amounts
         specified in Section 3.03(a), provided, however, that the amount
         paid under subsection (3) of that Section shall be three times
         the Participant's Compensation in the calendar year immediately
         preceding the year in which his or her Retirement occurred
         multiplied by the applicable percentage from the following
         table:

              Number of Full Years of Employment      
              With the Company in the capacity 
              of Division President or 
              Executive Corporate Officer             Percentage


                       5                                  0

                       7                                40%

                       8                                60%

                       9                                80%

                      10   or more                     100%              

         3.08   Limitation on Benefits.

         A Participant's benefit and the benefit of any Beneficiary under
         this Article 3 are subject to such Participant having satisfied
         any requirements of the Insurer as to certain conditions,
         including good health, at the time that the Company applies for
         new or increased insurance coverage to provide benefits
         hereunder.


         3.09   Assignment of Participant's Interest in Insurance.

         Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, a
         Participant shall have the right to absolutely and irrevocably
         assign by gift all of the Participant's right, title and
         interest in and to the life insurance death benefits provided
         under this Article 3.  This right shall be exerciseable by the
         execution and delivery to the Company of a written assignment,
         in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.  Upon
         receipt of such written assignment executed by the Participant
         and duly accepted by the assignee thereof, the Company shall
         consent thereto in writing, and shall thereafter treat the
         Participant's assignee as the sole owner of all of the
         Participant's right, title and interest in and to the life
         insurance death benefits provided under this Article 3.
         Thereafter, the Participant shall have no right, title or
         interest in and to such death benefits.  The Participant's
         assignment of all of his or her right, title and interest in and
         to the death benefit shall not reduce or eliminate the
         Participant's conditional right to receive the Supplemental
         Retirement Income Benefit under Article 4.

         3.10   Termination of Participation in Life Insurance Benefit.

         The participation of any Participant in the Life Insurance
         Benefit provided in this Article 3 will be automatically
         terminated by the occurrence of any of the following:


         (a)  Written notice from the Participant to the Company of a
              desire to terminate participation in the Plan;


         (b)  Deposit by the Company of the first payment of the
              Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit in the U. S. Mails. 


         (c)  Termination of the Participant's employment with the
              Company (other than due to the Participant's death) prior
              to Retirement; or


         (d)  The removal of the Participant from the position of a
              Division President or an Executive Corporate Officer of the
              Company (other than upon death or Retirement).



         3.11    Disposition of Policy Upon Termination of Participation.

         Upon termination of a Participant's participation in the Life
         Insurance Benefit for any reason listed in Section 3.10, all of
         the rights of the Participant in or to the Policy or those of
         his or her assignee, or any of their heirs, assigns or
         beneficiaries shall be automatically terminated and released.
         The Company may surrender or cancel the Policy for its cash
         surrender value, or it may change the beneficiary designation
         provisions of the Policy, naming itself or any other person or
         entity as revocable beneficiary thereof, or exercise any other
         ownership rights in and to such Policy.



                                     ARTICLE 4

                      Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit
         
         4.01   Eligibility for Benefit.

         A Participant may request participation in the Supplemental
         Retirement Income Benefit in lieu of coverage under the Life
         Insurance Benefit.  Upon consent of the Company to such request,
         the Participant shall be eligible to receive a Supplemental
         Retirement Income Benefit provided hereunder from the Company
         provided the Participant Retires from employment with the
         Company.

         Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Participant's
         entitlement to receive this Supplemental Retirement Income
         Benefit shall terminate, without notice, in the event of the
         death of the Participant prior to the deposit in the U. S. Mails
         by the Company of the first payment of the Supplemental
         Retirement Income Benefit.


         4.02   Vesting.

         A Participant's conditional right to receive the Supplemental
         Retirement Income Benefit at Retirement shall vest 20% per year
         (up to a maximum of 100%) upon the completion of each full year
         in the capacity of Division President or Executive Corporate
         Officer of the Company with said vesting commencing upon the
         completion of the Participant's employment for five full years
         in such a capacity.  This vesting is illustrated in the
         following table: 

              Number of Full Years of Employment      
              With the Company in the capacity 
              of Division President or                 Vesting 
              Executive Corporate Officer             Percentage


                       5                                  0

                       6                                20%

                       7                                40%

                       8                                60%

                       9                                80%

                      10   or more                     100%              

         4.03   Amount of Benefit.

         Each monthly Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit payment
         shall be equal to one-twelfth of thirty percent (30%) of the
         average of the Participant's Compensation for the three
         consecutive calendar years of highest Compensation preceding the
         date on which the Participant Retires and then multiplied by the
         Participant's vesting percentage (as set forth in the vesting
         table in Section 4.02) at the time of Retirement.  The payments
         shall be in the form of substantially equal monthly installment
         payments, for a period of 10 years, commencing as soon as
         practicable following the date the Participant Retires from
         employment with the Company.

         4.04   Death Benefit After Commencement of Retirement Benefits.

         In the event of the Participant's death after the deposit in the
         U. S. Mails by the Company of the first payment of the
         Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit, but prior to the
         completion of all such payments due and owing hereunder, 50% of
         the monthly amount previously paid to the Participant shall be
         continued to be paid to the Participant's surviving spouse, if
         any, on a monthly basis, until the earlier of:  (i) the
         expiration of the original 10 year period or (ii) the death of
         the spouse.   If Participant has no spouse living at the time of
         the Participant's death, the payments will then cease.


         4.05   Offset for Obligations to Company.

         If, at such time as the Participant becomes entitled to receive
         Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit payments pursuant to this
         Article 4, the Participant has any debt, obligation or other
         liability representing an amount due and owing to the Company,
         the Company may offset the amount owed it against the amount of
         benefits otherwise distributable hereunder. 


         4.06   No Trust Created.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Plan, no action taken pursuant
         to its provisions by either the Company or any Participant shall
         create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind, or a
         fiduciary relationship between the Company and the Participant,
         his or her spouse or any other person or entity except to the
         limited extent set forth in Section 5.01 herein.


         4.07   Benefits Payable Only From General Corporate Assets;
         Unsecured General Creditor Status of Participant.

         Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit payments to the
         Participant or his or her spouse shall be made from assets which
         shall continue, for all purposes, to be a part of the general,
         unrestricted assets of the Company.   No persons shall have any
         interest in any such assets by virtue of the provisions of this
         Plan.  The Company's obligation hereunder shall be an unfunded
         and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.  To the extent
         that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the
         Company under the provisions of this Plan, such right shall be
         no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of
         the Company.


         4.08   Benefits Not Transferable.

         Neither the Participant, his or her spouse, his or her
         Beneficiary, nor any other person with a beneficial interest
         under this Plan shall have any power or right to transfer,
         assign, anticipate, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any part
         or all of the amounts payable under this Article 4.  No such
         amounts shall be subject to seizure by any creditor or any such
         Beneficiary, by a proceeding at law or in equity, nor shall such
         amounts be transferable by operation of law in the event of
         bankruptcy, insolvency or death of the Participant, his or her
         spouse, his or her Beneficiary, or any other person with a
         beneficial interest hereunder.  Any such attempt at assignment
         or transfer shall be void.  These restrictions on the transfer

         a plan administrator designated by it, and it shall be

         5.02    Claim Procedures       

         (a)  Claim.   A person who believes that he is being denied a
              benefit to which he is entitled under the Plan (hereinafter
              referred to as a "Claimant") may file a written request for
              such benefit with the Company, setting forth his or her
              claim.  The request must be addressed to the CEO of the
              Company at its then principal executive offices.

         (b)  Claim Decision.   Upon receipt of a claim, the CEO shall
              advise the Claimant that a reply will be forthcoming within
              90 days and shall, in fact, deliver such reply within such
              period.  The CEO may, however, extend the reply period for
              an additional 90 days for reasonable cause.

         If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the CEO shall issue
         a written opinion, using language calculated to be understood by
         the Claimant, setting forth:

                 (i)    the specific reason or reasons for such denial;

                (ii)    the specific reference to pertinent provisions of
                        this Plan on which such denial is based;

               (iii)    a description of any additional material or
                        information necessary for the Claimant to perfect
                        his or her claim and an explanation why such
                        material or such information is necessary; and

                (iv)    appropriate information as to the steps to be
                        taken if the Claimant wishes to submit the claim
                        for review.

                                   Miscellaneous


         6.01   No Contract of Employment.

         Nothing contained herein shall be construed to be a contract of
         employment for any period of time, nor as conferring upon a
         Participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company
         in any capacity.


         6.02   Amendment of Plan.

         This Plan may be amended by the Company at any time, by delivery
         of written notice of such amendment to the Participants,
         provided, however, that no such amendment shall in any material
         way adversely affect any rights of a Participant, to the extent
         vested, in the Life Insurance Benefit after Retirement or any
         rights of a Retired Participant or spouse who is receiving
         payments under the Supplemental Retirement Income Benefit.


         6.03   Conflicting Provisions. 

         In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Plan
         and the provisions of any endorsement to a Policy, beneficiary
         designation or other document related to a Policy, the
         provisions of this Plan shall prevail.  No party shall assert or
         enforce any right which it may have in a Policy, the beneficiary
         designation thereunder, or other document which is inconsistent
         with the rights established by this Plan.


         6.04   Notice.

         Any notice, consent or demand required or permitted to be given
         under the provisions of this Plan shall be in writing, and shall
         be signed by the party giving or making the same.  If such
         notice, consent, or demand is mailed to a party hereto, it shall
         be sent by United States certified mail, postage prepaid,
         addressed to such party's last known address as shown on the
         records of the Company.  The date of such mailing shall be
         deemed the date of notice, consent or demand.  Either party may
         change the address to which notice is to be sent by giving
         notice of the change of address in the manner aforesaid.


         6.05   Governing Law.

         This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
         the internal laws of the State of New Hampshire.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has executed this Plan, such
         execution first having been duly authorized by the Salary and
         Employee Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of the
         Company pursuant to a delegation of authority from said Board of
         Directors.

                       STANDEX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
         
         
                            1994 STOCK OPTION PLAN
         
         
         
              1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this Plan is to secure for 
         Standex International Corporation (the "Company") and its 
         shareholders the benefits arising from capital stock 
         ownership by those key officers or employees of the Company 
         and of its subsidiaries who will be responsible for its 
         future growth and continued success.  The Plan will provide a 
         means whereby such officers or employees may purchase shares 
         of the Common Stock of the Company pursuant to options.
         
         
              2.   Types of Options.  Options shall be granted under 
         this Plan by the Salary and Employee Benefits Committee (the 
         "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company which 
         shall be made up of two or more directors each of whom is (i) 
         a disinterested person, as that term is defined in Section 
         16b-(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 
         Act"), as amended and (ii) an outside director, as that term 
         is defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
         1986, as amended (the "Code").  Options may be either 
         incentive stock options ("Incentive Stock Options") meeting 
         the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code or 
         non-statutory options which are not intended to meet the 
         requirements of Section 422(b).
         
         
              3.   Administration.  This Plan will be administered by 
         the Committee, whose construction and interpretation of the 
         terms and provisions of this Plan shall be final and 
         conclusive.
         
              	   The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant 
         options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock to 
         such key officers or employees as it shall determine and 
         shall issue shares upon exercise of such options.  The 
         Committee shall have the authority to determine the time at 
         which options will be granted, the type of each option 
         granted, the number of shares which will be subject to each 
         option as well as, subject to the provisions of this Plan, 
         the terms and provisions of each agreement with officers or 
         employees covering the options.
         
              	   The Committee shall have authority, subject to the 
         provisions of the Plan, to construe the respective option 
         agreements as well as this Plan and to prescribe, amend and 
         rescind such rules and regulations relating to this Plan as 
         it shall deem proper.  The Committee shall make all 
         determinations which, in its judgment, are necessary or 
         desirable for the proper administration of this Plan.  No 
         member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or 
         determination concerning this Plan, if made in good faith.
         
         
              4.   Eligibility.  Individuals who are key officers or 
         employees of the Company or any subsidiary corporation 
         (including officers and directors who are not employees) as 
         determined, from time to time, by the Committee, shall be 
         eligible to participate in this Plan.  Members of the 
         Committee shall not be eligible to be granted stock options 
         under the Plan while serving on the Committee.  No person 
         shall be granted any Incentive Stock Options under this Plan 
         who, at the time such option is granted, owns directly or 
         indirectly, Common Stock of the Company possessing more than 
         10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of 
         stock of the Company or of any parent or subsidiary.
         
         
              5.   Stock Subject To Plan.  Subject to adjustment as 
         provided in Section 14 hereof, the stock to be offered under 
         the Plan shall consist of shares of the Common Stock of the 
         Company, par value $1.50 per share, and may include 
         authorized but unissued shares or previously issued shares 
         reacquired by the Company and held in its treasury.  The 
         aggregate amount of stock to be delivered upon exercise of 
         all options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 400,000 
         shares (as presently constituted). If any option granted 
         hereunder shall expire or terminate for any reason without 
         having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject 
         to such option shall again be available for subsequent option 
         grants under this Plan.  
         
              	   Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14 
         hereof, the net maximum number of shares of Common Stock with 
         respect to which options may be granted to any employee under 
         the Plan shall not exceed 400,000 shares during the ten-year 
         term of the Plan.  For the purposes of calculating such 
         maximum number, (a) an option shall continue to be treated as 
         outstanding notwithstanding its repricing, cancellation or 
         expiration and (b) the repricing of an outstanding option or 
         the issuance of a new option in substitution for a cancelled 
         option shall be deemed to constitute the grant of a new 
         additional option separate from the original grant of the 
         option that is repriced or cancelled.
         
         
              6.   Purchase Price.  The purchase price of the stock 
         covered by each option shall be as follows: (a) the fair 
         market value of such stock, as determined by the Committee, 
         on the date the option is granted in connection with any 
         incentive stock options granted hereunder and (b) at or below 
         the fair market value of such stock (but in no event less 
         than 50% of the fair market value of the stock), as 
         determined by the Committee, on the date the option is 
         granted in connection with any non-statutory stock options 
         granted hereunder.
         
              	   The purchase price of any shares purchased shall be 
         paid in full at the time of each such purchase as follows: 
         (a) in cash, (b) by check payable to the order of the 
         Company, (c) by tender of stock certificates in proper form 
         for transfer to the Company, representing shares of the 
         Company's Common Stock valued at the fair market value of the 
         Common Stock (as determined by the Committee) on the 
         preceding business day, or (d) by any combination of the 
         foregoing, provided, however, that no shares may be tendered 
         in payment of the exercise price if such shares were acquired 
         by previous exercise of an incentive or non-statutory stock 
         option unless and until a waiting period established, from 
         time to time, by the Committee has been satisfied.  The 
         obligation to pay the purchase price in full as stated above 
         shall not preclude the option holder from borrowing funds 
         from the Company pursuant to any plan covering such loans as 
         may then be in effect.
         
         
              7.   Duration of Options.  Each option and all rights 
         thereunder shall expire on such date as the Committee may 
         determine, which shall be, in no event, later than ten years 
         from the date on which the option is granted (or such shorter 
         period as may be applicable under Section 422 of the Code.
         
         
              8.   Exercise of Options.  Any option may be exercised 
         in whole at any time or in part from time to time during its 
         term, provided, however, that no option may be exercised 
         during the first six months of its term.  Subject to this 
         limitation, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide 
         that an option, may not be exercised in whole or in part, for 
         any further period or periods of time specified by the 
         Committee.
         
         
              9.   Nontransferability of Options.  Options issued 
         under this Plan shall, by their terms, be nontransferable by 
         the option holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, 
         provided, however, that they may be transferred pursuant to a 
         will or to the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant 
         to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the 
         Code, 26 U.S.C. Section 1 et. seq. or Title I of the Employment 
         Retirement Income Security Act or rules thereunder.  Options 
         shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the holder only 
         by the holder.
         
              10.  Effect of Termination of Employment.  No option may 
         be exercised unless, at the time of such exercise, the option 
         holder is, and has been continuously since the date of grant 
         of his or her option, an officer or employee of the Company 
         or one of its parent corporations or subsidiaries, provided, 
         however, that:
         
                   (a)  if (i) the option is a non-statutory stock 
                        option and the option holder's employment with 
                        the Company terminates other than by reason of 
                        the option holder's death, disability or 
                        retirement, or (ii) if the option is an 
                        incentive stock option and the option holder's 
                        employment with the Company terminates other 
                        than by reason of the option holder's death or 
                        disability, the option shall terminate and its 
                        exercisability shall cease three months after 
                        the date that the option holder's employment 
                        terminates;
         
                   (b)  if a holder of an incentive stock option (i) 
                        becomes disabled (within the meaning of 
                        Section 105(d)(4) of the Code) while in such 
                        employ, or (ii) dies while in such employ or 
                        within three months after the option holder 
                        ceases to be such an officer or employee of 
                        the Company, such incentive stock options may 
                        be exercised within a period of up to one year 
                        after the date the option holder ceases to be 
                        such an officer or employee because of such 
                        disability or death;
         
              	   (c)	if the holder of a non-statutory stock option 
                        (i) becomes disabled (within the meaning of 
                        Section 105(d)(4) of the Code) while in such 
                        employ, or (ii) dies while in such employ or 
                        within three months after the option holder 
                        ceases to be such an officer or employee of 
                        the Company, or (iii) retires under a 
                        retirement plan of the Company, such 
                        non-statutory stock options may be exercised 
                        within a period of up to one year after the 
                        date the option holder ceases to be such an 
                        officer or employee because of such 
                        disability, death or retirement.
         
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no option may be exercised 
         after the expiration date of the option and options may be 
         cancelled by the Committee at any time if, in the opinion of 
         the Committee, the option holder engages in activities 
         contrary to the interests of the Company or any of its 
         subsidiaries.  For all purposes of this Plan and any option 
         granted hereunder, "employment" shall be defined in 
         accordance with the provisions of Section 1.421-7(h) of the 
         Regulations under the Code (or any successor regulations).
         
              	   Further, in the event of termination of employment 
         resulting from retirement or disability of the option holder, 
         any and all outstanding non-statutory options, which are not 
         fully vested, will continue to vest in accordance with their 
         respective provisions for a period of one year from the date 
         of termination of employment.  In the case of all other 
         terminations of employment and in the case of incentive stock 
         options, vesting will cease as of the date of such 
         termination.
         
              11.  Incentive Stock Options.  The aggregate fair market 
         value (determined as of the respective date or dates of 
         grant) of the Common Stock which may be made the subject of 
         Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan (and under 
         any other incentive stock option plans of the Company, and 
         any parent corporation and subsidiary) and first exercisable 
         by any officer or employee in any one calendar year shall not 
         exceed the sum of $100,000.
         
         
              12.  Issuance of Shares.  No person entitled to exercise 
         any option granted under this Plan shall have any of the 
         rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in 
         respect of any shares of stock issuable upon exercise of such 
         option until certificates representing such shares shall have 
         been issued and delivered.  No shares shall be issued and 
         delivered upon exercise of any option unless and until, in 
         the opinion of counsel for the Company, any applicable 
         registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, any 
         applicable listing requirements of any national securities 
         exchange on which stock of the same class is then listed and 
         any other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies 
         having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery, shall 
         have been fully complied with.
         
         
              13.  Investment Representation.  The Company may require 
         any option holder, as a condition of exercising an option, to 
         give written assurance in form and substance satisfactory to 
         the Company to the effect that such person is acquiring the 
         Common Stock subject to the option for his or her own 
         account, for investment and not with any present intention of 
         selling or otherwise distributing the same.
         
         
              14.  Adjustments.  If the outstanding shares of the 
         Common Stock of the Company are changed by reason of a 
         recapitalization or reclassification of the Company's capital 
         stock or if there shall be a stock split, stock dividend, 
         subdivision or combination affecting the Common Stock, an 
         appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made in the 
         maximum number and kind of shares as to which options may be 
         granted under this Plan.  A corresponding adjustment changing 
         the number or kind of shares allocated to unexercised options 
         or portions thereof, which shall have been granted prior to 
         any such change, shall likewise be made.  Any such adjustment 
         in the outstanding options shall be made without change in 
         the  aggregate purchase price applicable to the unexercised 
         portion of the option but with a corresponding adjustment in 
         the price for each share or other unit of any security 
         covered by the option.
         
              	   In the event of a consolidation or merger or sale 
         of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in 
         which outstanding shares of Common Stock are exchanged for 
         securities, cash or other property of any other corporation 
         or business entity or in the event of a liquidation of the 
         Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, or the board 
         of directors of any corporation assuming the obligations of 
         the Company, may, in its discretion, take any one or more of 
         the following actions, as to outstanding options: (i) provide 
         that such options shall be assumed, or equivalent options 
         shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding 
         corporation (or an affiliate thereof), provided that any such 
         options substituted for Incentive Stock Options shall meet 
         the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code, (ii) upon 
         written notice to the option holders, provide that all 
         unexercised options will terminate immediately prior to the 
         consummation of such transaction unless exercised by the 
         option holder within a specified period following the date of 
         such notice, (iii) in the event of a merger under the terms 
         of which holders of the Common Stock of the Company will 
         receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each 
         share surrendered in the merger (the "Merger Price"), make or 
         provide for a cash payment to the option holders equal to the 
         difference between (A) the Merger Price times the number of 
         shares of Common Stock subject to such outstanding options 
         (to the extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of 
         the Merger Price) and (B) the aggregate exercise price of all 
         such outstanding options in exchange for the termination of 
         such options, and (iv) provide that all or any outstanding 
         options shall become exercisable in full immediately prior to 
         such event.
         
              	   Adjustments under this Section 14 shall be made by 
         the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination as 
         to what adjustments shall be made, and the extent thereof, 
         shall be final and conclusive.  No fractional shares of stock 
         shall be issued under the Plan for any such adjustment.
         
         
              15.  No Special Employment Rights.  Nothing contained in 
         this Plan or in any option granted under this Plan shall 
         confer upon any option holder any right with respect to the 
         continuation of his or her employment by the Company (or any 
         parent or subsidiary) or interfere in any way with the right 
         of the Company (or any parent or subsidiary), subject to the 
         terms of any separate employment agreement to the contrary, 
         at any time to terminate such employment or to increase or 
         decrease the compensation of the option holder from the rate 
         in existence at the time of the grant of an option.  Whether 
         an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or 
         government service, shall constitute termination of 
         employment shall be determined by the Board of Directors at 
         the time.
         
         
              16.  Other Employee Benefits.  The amount of any 
         compensation deemed to be received by an officer or employee 
         as a result of the exercise of a stock option will not 
         constitute "earnings" with respect to which any other 
         employee benefits of such officer or employee are determined, 
         including, without limitation, benefits under any pension, 
         ESOP or life insurance plan.
         
         
              17.  Amendment, Suspension and Termination of the Plan.  
         The Board of Directors may, at any time and from time to 
         time, suspend, terminate, modify or amend this Plan in any 
         respect, provided that (except to the extent expressly 
         required or permitted by the Plan) no such amendment shall, 
         without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, 
         effectuate a change for which shareholder approval is 
         required in order for the Plan to continue to qualify under 
         Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the 1934 Act.
         
              	   The termination or any modification or amendment of 
         the Plan shall not, without the consent of an option holder, 
         affect his or her rights under an option previously granted.  
         The Board of Directors shall have the right to amend or 
         modify the terms and provisions of this Plan and of any 
         outstanding Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan 
         to the extent necessary to qualify any or all such options 
         for such favorable Federal income tax treatment (including 
         deferral of taxation upon exercise) as may be afforded 
         incentive stock options under Section 422a of the Code.
         
         
              18.  Withholding.  The Company's obligation to deliver 
         shares upon the exercise of any option granted under this 
         Plan shall be subject to the option holder's satisfaction of 
         all applicable federal, state and local income and employment 
         tax withholding requirements.  An option holder may elect to 
         satisfy all applicable Federal, state and local income and 
         employment tax withholding requirements by: (a) authorizing 
         the Company to retain a portion of the option shares; (b) 
         delivering other already owned shares to the Company; (c) 
         payment in cash or by check; or (d) any combination of the 
         foregoing.
         
         
              19.  Application of Section 16 of the 1934 Act.  With 
         respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the 1934 Act, 
         transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with all 
         applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under 
         the 1934 Act.  To the extent any provision of the Plan or 
         action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be 
         construed or deemed amended, to the extent permitted by law, 
         deemed advisable by the Committee and necessary to conform 
         with such requirements with respect to such person.
              
         
              20.  Effective Date and Expiration of Plan.  This Plan 
         shall be effective on July 27, 1994, subject to its approval 
         by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock 
         of the Company prior to December 31, 1994, and shall expire 
         automatically on July 27, 2004 (except as to options 
         previously granted and outstanding at that date).
         
         
              21.  Change in Control.  Notwithstanding any other 
         provision to the contrary in this Plan, in the event of a 
         Change in Control (as defined below), all options outstanding 
         as of the date such Change in Control occurs shall become 
         exercisable in full, whether or not otherwise exercisable in 
         accordance with their terms.
         
              	   A "Change in Control" shall occur or be deemed to 
         have occurred only if any of the following events occur:
         
              	   (a)	any "person", as such term is used in Section 
                        13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
                        of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), 
                        (other than the Company, any trustee or other 
                        fiduciary holding securities under an employee 
                        benefit plan of the Company, or any 
                        corporation owned directly or indirectly by 
                        the stockholders of the Company in 
                        substantially the same proportion as their 
                        ownership of stock of the Company) is or 
                        becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in 
                        Rule 13(d) under the Exchange Act), directly 
                        or indirectly, of securities of the Company 
                        representing 50% or more of the combined 
                        voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
                        securities;
         
              	   (b)	individuals who, as of July 27, 1994, 
                        constitute the Board of Directors of the 
                        Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any 
                        reason to constitute at least a majority of 
                        the Board, provided that any person becoming a 
                        director subsequent to July 27, 1994 whose 
                        election, or nomination for election by the 
                        Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote 
                        of at least a majority of the directors then 
                        comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an 
                        election or nomination of an individual whose 
                        initial assumption of office is in connection 
                        with an actual or threatened election contest 
                        relating to the election of the directors of 
                        the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 
                        14a-11 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange 
                        Act) shall be, for purposes of this Section, 
                        considered a member of the Incumbent Board;
         
              	   (c)	the stockholders of the Company approve a 
                        merger or consolidation of the Company with 
                        any other corporation, other than (i) a merger 
                        or consolidation which would result in the 
                        voting securities of the Company outstanding 
                        immediately prior thereto continuing to 
                        represent (either by remaining outstanding or 
                        by being converted into voting securities of 
                        the surviving entity) more than 80% of the 
                        combined voting power of the voting securities 
                        of the Company or such surviving entity 
                        outstanding immediately after such merger or 
                        consolidation or (ii) a merger or 
                        consolidation effected to implement a 
                        recapitalization of the Company (or similar 
                        transaction) in which no "person" (as 
                        hereinabove defined) acquires more than 50% of 
                        the combined voting power of the Company's 
                        then outstanding securities; or
         
              	   (d)	the stockholders of the Company approve a plan 
                        of complete liquidation of the Company or an 
                        agreement for the sale or disposition by the 
                        Company of all or substantially all of the 
                        Company's assets.
         
              22.  Foreign Jurisdictions.  The Committee may adopt, 
         amend and terminate such arrangements, not inconsistent with 
         the intent of the Plan as it may deem necessary or desirable 
         to make available tax or other benefits of the laws of 
         foreign jurisdictions to option holders who are subject to 
         such laws.

{Profile}

Standex International is a diversified manufacturer producing and marketing a
wide variety of useful, quality products.  The Company enjoys a broad and
well-balanced earnings base by virtue of its strong market position in selected
areas of operation.

Three Products Groups - Institutional Products, Industrial Products, and
Graphics/Mail Order - are comprised of nine operating divisions.  The Company
operates 86 plants located in 14 countries, and its products are sold
throughout the world.

Standex's policy of balanced diversification - coupled with aggressive
management and conservative financial techniques - has enabled the Company to
achieve above average growth in sales and earnings since its founding in 1955.

In August of this year Standex paid its 120th consecutive quarterly dividend.
This represents 30 years of uninterrupted dividend payments since first
becoming a public corporation in 1964.

{TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS}

We are very pleased with the results for fiscal 1994. Despite lingering
weakness in many of our overseas markets, and difficult adjustments required by
the decline in U.S. defense spending, record levels were established for sales,
net income, return on equity, and earnings per share. These were very
gratifying results.

Operating Results:

For the fiscal year ended June 30th, Standex reported sales of $529,399,000 a
4.6% increase over fiscal year 1993 shipments of $506,312,000. Net Income rose
13.1% to $27,147,000, compared to $24,012,000 generated during the previous
fiscal year. With a reduced number of shares outstanding, earnings per share
increased by 21.1% to a new high of $1.78 per share up from $1.47 reported for
fiscal 1993.  Return on equity reached 22.8%. This is a very solid return on
net worth for the types of markets in which Standex operates.

We continued to invest aggressively in the long term growth of our various
businesses. Over the past twelve months $13,238,000 was invested in new plant
and equipment in order to both expand and upgrade existing facilities. Over the
past five years, capital expenditures have totaled $66,147,000. The
Corporation's physical plant has never been in better shape. With worldwide
business becoming more competitive every day, efficient manufacturing
facilities are absolutely essential.

At the same time, a constantly increasing level of global trade offers strong
prospects for future growth. Just over the past several years, Standex
Divisions have developed substantial markets in Mexico for commercial
refrigeration equipment, casters, hydraulic cylinders, textured molds, and
bindery equipment. Shipments in all of these areas have been increasing
steadily.

Dividend Increase:

The Board of Directors increased the dividend twice during fiscal 1994, for a
total increase of 16.7%. This is an obvious reflection of the Board's
confidence in the basic earnings power of the Corporation, and continues a
policy of paying out to shareholders approximately one third of reported net
income. Standex has now paid uninterrupted quarterly dividends for 30 years.
The dividend has been increased 29 times over that same period.

Stockholder Return:

The Corporation continued to buy-in shares during fiscal 1994. During the
twelve months ended June 30, 1994, an additional 897,136 shares were purchased.
Since the inception of this program in fiscal 1985, a total of 16,462,841
shares have been acquired, for a total expenditure of $194,964,750. This works
out to an average cost of $11.84 per share and has cut the number of shares
outstanding by more than half. It is our intention to continue to buy in stock
whenever it appears advantageous to do so.

We are determined to create value for our shareholders and believe that the
dividend and stock buy-back policies which have been followed by the
Corporation have accomplished precisely that. By being broadly diversified,
Standex is fortunate in that it has a relatively stable and predictable level
of profitability. At the same time, the moderate growth which characterizes
many of our markets typically results in a cash flow in excess of our immediate
operating requirements.  We have utilized this excess cash flow, coupled with a
judicious use of debt, to reduce the number of shares outstanding, and to
steadily increase the dividend paid on the remaining shares.

{two}

When this program was first implemented in fiscal 1985, Standex's stockholder
equity was $144,019,000, and the market capitalization was $166,248,000. Since
that date, the Corporation has repurchased $195 million of common stock and
paid out $68 million in dividends. A total of $263 million has been returned to
the shareholders either in the form of dividends paid out, or shares
repurchased. After that return, the market capitalization of the remaining
shares on June 30, 1994 had risen to $401 million.
<PAGE>

Obviously, there are many elements which have to be considered in seeking to
balance both a short term desire for profit, and longer term considerations.
Our first priority has always been to provide ample financing for existing
operations in terms of both physical plant and working capital needs. 
We are also constantly re-examining the total debt {Thomas L. King} which the
Corporation might reasonably be able to carry relative to projected cash flows.
Over the past four years, our interest expense coverage has been as follows:

                Fiscal 1994       8.1 times
                Fiscal 1993       7.7 times
                Fiscal 1992       6.1 times
                Fiscal 1991       5.1 times

With interest rates currently trending upward, this is obviously an area which
will be watched closely, but we anticipate that fiscal 1995 will generate a
strong free cash flow. During the year just ended, Standex experienced an
unusually large expansion of working capital requirements as a new
manufacturing facility came on stream with the attendant pipeline filling. We
do not foresee a similar expansion in the year ahead.

A Final Word:

Standex has been successful in operating a widely diverse group of companies
through a decentralized management structure, with a strong financial reporting
system, and tight control of cash. This has allowed the Corporation to prosper
during periods of economic expansion while, at the same time, providing
defensive qualities through periods of economic decline. During the recent
recession (1990-1991), Standex's earnings per share declined 5.4%.  Since the
end of that recession in 1991, the earnings per share have increased by 69.5%.

We are pleased with the effectiveness of our current corporate structure, and
confident in the skills and dedication of an outstanding group of employees.

{INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS GROUP}

The Institutional Products Group is composed of Standex Institutional Products
and Standex Commercial Products. During Fiscal 1994 these two Divisions
represented 46% of total Corporate sales and 50% of total operating income.
This compares with 42% of total Corporate sales and 46% of total operating
income during fiscal 1993.

Master-Bilt's two factories in Mississippi produce a complete line of
commercial refrigeration equipment, ranging from small ice-cream dipping
cabinets all the way up to large refrigerated warehouses. End users include
supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants, dairies, florists and beverage
distributors.

Federal Industries manufactures both refrigerated and non-refrigerated display
cases for the food service industry. The Company enjoys a particularly strong
market position in the bakery industry with a broad line of proofers, dough
retarders and freezers.

Jarvis, which was originally acquired by Standex in 1968, is a major producer
of industrial casters and wheels for the North American market. Production
facilities are located in Massachusetts, Michigan and California, with assembly
and distribution sites in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. The Company has
achieved considerable success in limiting the market penetration of foreign
imports, and a major expansion of the Michigan factory was nearing completion
at fiscal year end.

BK Industries of South Carolina and Barbecue King of England produce pressure
fryers, commercial barbecue oven/rotisseries, cook and hold ovens, doughnut
fryers and display merchandisers. The U.K. market, which had been depressed,
recovered very nicely during the past year.

Williams Healthcare Systems, headquartered in Illinois, is the world's leading
manufacturer of chiropractic and traction tables. The Company also produces a
line of equipment for the related, but broader, physical therapy market.
Uncertainty on health care reform has held down domestic markets, 
but exports have remained firm.

The Toastswell Company of St. Louis, Missouri manufactures a broad line of
commercial waffle bakers (shown on the front cover of this Annual Report), as
well as toasters, griddles and food warmers for the restaurant industry.

National Metal Industries, located in Springfield, Massachusetts, is the
largest manufacturer of Christmas tree stands in the world. The Company also
produces a variety of fabricated metal products and specialty hardware
including copier work stations, metal storage cabinets and custom precision
stampings.

Snappy Air Distribution Products is headquartered in Minnesota with additional
production facilities in Colorado. The Company's highly automated factories 
produce pipe, duct and fittings for heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
residential housing in the Midwestern and Southwestern United States.
Manufacturing efficiencies and aggressive marketing have enabled the Company to

{MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS}

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 1994, the Company repurchased $23.5 million of its Common Stock,
expended $13.2 million in property, plant and equipment and paid $7.8 million
in cash dividends to its stockholders. These transactions were financed from
internally generated funds and borrowings under the Company's existing bank
credit agreements which are described in the footnotes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Company intends to continue its policy of using its
funds to acquire property, plant and equipment, pay dividends, purchase its
Common Stock and make acquisitions when conditions are favorable. Net Cash
Provided by Operating Activities was $18.2 million in 1994 as compared to
$36.5 million in 1993. The decrease of $18.3 million in 1994 from 1993 was
primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and inventory of $8.3 million
and $7.7 million, respectively. The increase in inventory was caused by the
growth in demand reported by the Institutional segment, which is discussed
below, and was required to meet anticipated sales requirements in fiscal
1995. The rise in accounts receivable was mainly due to the growth in fourth
quarter Net Sales reported by the Institutional segment. Due to the increase
in inventory, accounts payable increased $1.4 million which had a positive
effect on operating cash flows. Also, the effect of activity reported within
accrued payroll, employee benefits and other liabilities in 1993 resulted in
an increase in operating cash flows of $499,000 as compared to a decrease of
$3.2 million in 1994. This decline of $3.7 million in 1994 was due to many
<PAGE>

factors none of which was individually significant. At June 30, 1994, the
Company had the ability to borrow an additional $25.9 million under existing
bank credit agreements. The Company believes that this resource, along with
the Company's internally generated funds, will be sufficient to meet its
anticipated needs for the foreseeable future.

Fiscal 1994 as Compared to Fiscal 1993

Net Sales increased $23.1 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended June 30, 1994 as
compared to the fiscal year ended 1993. Changes in unit volume, and not prices,
were primarily responsible for the variation in Net Sales reported for each
segment. As shown in the table above, only the Graphics/Mail Order segment
reported a decline in Net Sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.
The Institutional segment reported record Net Sales for the year ended June 30,
1994 with a $29.4 million, or 13.8% increase. The majority of this segment's
divisions experienced improvement in Net Sales as compared to fiscal year 1993.
However, this segment's Master-Bilt Products division reported the single
greatest improvement due to the increased sales strength of a product line
which was introduced during fiscal year 1993.  The Jarvis Caster Group and
Snappy Air Distribution Products also reported noteworthy rises in Net Sales
due to increased customer demand. 

The Graphics/Mail Order segment registered a $6.8 million, or 4.6%, decline in
Net Sales partially due to the cyclical nature of its Doubleday Bros. & Co.
division. The sluggish European economy and the decline in the average annual
exchange rates of many European currencies against the dollar in 1994, as
compared to 1993, has resulted in a decrease in Net Sales reported by this
segment's James Burn Group. Net Sales reported by the Industrial segment rose
slightly in fiscal 1994. A noteworthy improvement in Net Sales was reported by
this segment's Standex Electronics division. However, this growth was offset by
a decline in Net Sales reported by other operations. The European recession,
particularly in the automotive industry, negatively impacted the Company's
Roehlen Industries - Europe operations. Also, weakness in U.S. defense related
industries has resulted in a decline in Net Sales reported by this segment's
Spincraft operations. The Gross Profit Margin percentage registered a slight
decrease from 33.2% in 1993 to 32.7% in 1994. The Gross Profit Margin
percentage reported by the Industrial and Graphics/Mail Order segments remained
consistent with the prior year. The Institutional segment reported a slight
decrease in the Gross Profit Margin percentage from 28.6% in 1993 to 28.1%
primarily due to competitive pressures on profit margins. Selling, General and
Administrative Expense (SG&A) rose approximately $1.1 million in 1994 as
compared to 1993. However, as a percentage of Net Sales, SG&A decreased from
24.3% in 1993 to 23.4%. The Institutional segment reported an increase in SG&A
in direct proportion with its growth in Net Sales. This increase was offset by
a decrease in expenses reported by the Graphics/Mail Order and Industrial
segments. Due to the respective decline and stabilization of Net Sales reported
by these two segments, management implemented cost reduction programs during
the year which resulted in a decline in these expenses. In 1994, a slight
decrease was experienced in Depreciation and Amortization Expenses. These
expenses were $12.5 million in 1994, versus $12.9 million in 1993. There were
no significant changes within any segment. Despite an increase in borrowings,
Interest Expense increased only slightly in 1994. This is primarily due to
lower interest rates in the first eight months of fiscal 1994 as compared to
the same period in 1993. The above resulted in an improvement in Income Before
Income Taxes of approximately $4.8 million, or 12.7%, in 1994 as compared to
1993. The effective tax rate remained fairly stable at 35.7% in 1994 which
represented a slight decline from the 35.9% effective tax rate reported in
1993. Due to the above factors, Net Income rose $3.1 million, or 13.1%.

Fiscal 1993 as Compared to Fiscal 1992 

Net Sales increased $29.1 million, or 6.1%, in 1993 as compared to 1992.

Changes in unit volume, and not prices, were primarily responsible for the
variation in Net Sales reported for each segment.
As shown in the table above, all of the segments reported improvement in Net
Sales with the exception of the Graphics/Mail Order segment which declined
slightly. This was due to various factors none of which were significant.
With a $23.8 million, or 12.7%, growth in Net Sales as compared to 1992, the
Institutional segment reported record sales. The increase reported by this
segment was attributed to improved performances at several divisions including
BK Industries, the Jarvis Caster Group and Snappy Air Distribution Products.
Also, a $3.0 million increase in this Net Sales was attributable to the
acquisition of Toastswell in May 1992. However, the largest improvement in Net
Sales of $15.4 million was reported by this segment's Master-Bilt Products
division due to the introduction of a new product line.

The Industrial segment reported a $7.2 million, or 5.1%, increase in Net Sales.
Significant growth within the worldwide texturing product line accounted for
the majority of this segment's expansion in Net Sales. Also, Roehlen
Engraving's Net Sales increased primarily due to a 12 week strike in 1992 which
negatively affected Net Sales.

The Gross Profit Margin percentage registered a slight increase in 1993 to
33.2% from 32.8% in 1992. The Industrial segment's Gross Profit Margin
percentage rose to 33.5% versus 32.2% in 1992. The Institutional segment also
reported an increase from 28.0% in 1992 to 28.6% in 1993. The growth reported
by these two segments resulted primarily from increased quantities sold causing
an overall reduction in per unit costs. A decrease in the Gross Profit Margin
percentage was reported by the Graphics/Mail Order segment to 31.1% in 1993 as
compared to 32.2% in 1992. This reduction was primarily due to lower sales
volumes combined with competitive pressures on profit margins due to the
European recession.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) rose approximately $7.0
million in 1993 as compared to 1992. However, as a percentage of Net Sales,
SG&A remained stable at approximately 24.0% for both periods. The Industrial
and Institutional segments reported increases in SG&A primarily due to their
growth in Net Sales. These increases were partially offset by a decline in SG&A
reported by the Graphics/Mail Order segment. Due to the slight decline in this
segment's Net Sales, measures were taken to reduce costs through staff
reductions and reevaluation of marketing programs. In 1993, an increase was
experienced in Depreciation and Amortization Expenses. In 1993, these expenses
were $12.9 million versus $11.9 million in 1992. There were no significant
changes within any segment. Despite increased borrowings during 1993, Interest
Expense decreased approximately $1 million in 1993 as compared to 1992. This
was the result of lower interest rates in the United States where the Company
has most of its borrowings.

The above resulted in an improvement in Income Before Taxes of approximately

$3.8 million, or 11.3%, in 1993 as compared to 1992. The effective tax rate
increased slightly from 34.9% in 1992 to 35.9% in 1993. The tax rate for 1992
was lower than normal primarily due to the receipt of non-recurring executive
life insurance proceeds which were non-taxable. Due to the above factors, Net
Income rose $2.1 million, or 9.6%

Other Matters

Inflation has not been a significant factor in Net Income in recent years
because of the relatively modest rate of price increases in the economies of
the United States and of the other countries where the Company has operations.

Environmental matters 

The Company is a party to various claims and legal proceedings, generally
incidental to its business and has recorded an appropriate provision for the
resolution of such matters. As explained more fully in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company does not expect the ultimate
disposition of the matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial
statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, "Accounting for Impairment of a
Loan," and SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". The Company has evaluated the effects of these standards and
believes that they will not affect the Company's financial condition or
operating results.

{NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS}

Summary of Accounting Policies


Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Standex International Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Includes highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three
months or less. The recorded amount of cash equivalents approximates fair
market value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their 
estimated useful lives using primarily the straight-line method.

Goodwill

The excess of purchase price of acquired companies over the fair value of net
identifiable assets at date of acquisition has been recorded as goodwill and is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a forty-year period. Accumulated
amortization aggregated $6,864,000 and $6,250,000 at June 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The Company annually evaluates the net balance of goodwill based
on the projected operating income of the respective businesses on an
undiscounted cash flow basis.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars
at year-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated using average
exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustment is reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from non-U.S. currency
transactions are included in results of operations.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share are computed based on the average number of shares and share
equivalents outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of shares
used in the determination of earnings per share was 15,293,351, 16,375,964 and
17,836,576 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. All references to share and
per share data have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split in
May, 1993.

Bank Credit Agreements

The Company has the option to borrow up to $135,000,000 on an unsecured
short-term basis at rates which are generally below the prime rate (such rates
varied from 3.4% to 4.5% during 1994). In addition, the Company has a revolving
credit agreement with four banks. The agreement provides for a maximum credit
line of $125,000,000 until December 31, 1997, at which time outstanding loans
will be due and payable. Borrowings under the agreement period would generally
bear interest at rates which approximate the prime rate. The Company is
required to pay a commitment fee of up to 1/2% on the average daily unused
amount. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit
agreement during 1994, 1993 or 1992. 

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

The Company may refinance the unsecured short-term borrowings on a long-term
basis under the revolving credit agreement discussed above. As such, the
short-term outstanding borrowings, which are not expected to be paid within a
year, are classified as long-term debt, and the debt repayment schedule, as
presented below, is based on the terms of the revolving credit agreement.
Management believes that the recorded amount of short-term borrowings
approximate their fair value.

Loan Covenants and Repayment Schedule 

The Company's loan agreements contain provisions relating to the maintenance of
working capital and other financial ratios, restrictions on additional
borrowings, treasury stock purchases and payments of dividends. At June 30,
1994, retained earnings of  $6,365,000 were available for dividends and other
distributions; this limitation will be augmented in the future by 50% of net
income subsequent to June 30, 1994. It is anticipated the debt to which this
covenant applies will be paid in full by September 30, 1994.

Debt is due as follows: 1995, $9,576,000; 1996, $5,375,000; 1997, $305,000;
1998, $106,075,000; 1999, $190,000; and thereafter $909,000.

Commitments

The Company leases certain property and equipment under agreements with initial
terms ranging from one to twenty years. Rental expense for the years ended June
30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was approximately $5,900,000, $5,400,000 and
$4,800,000, respectively. At June 30, 1994, the minimum annual rental
commitments under noncancelable operating leases, principally real estate, were
approximately: 1995, $3,700,000; 1996, $2,700,000; 1997, $1,600,000; 1998,
$1,100,000; 1999, $800,000; after 1999, $500,000.

Contingencies

The Company is a party to various claims and legal proceedings related to
environmental matters generally incidental to its business. Management has
evaluated each matter based upon the advice of its independent environmental
consultants and has recorded an appropriate provision for the resolution of
such matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies."  Management believes that the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial statements.

At June 30, 1994, accumulated retained earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
totaled $35,185,000. No provision for U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes
has been made because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested
indefinitely or the distribution of any remaining amount would be principally
offset by foreign tax credits. The determination of the withholding taxes that
would be payable upon remittance of these earnings and the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not
practicable.

Employee Benefit Plans

Retirement Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have several company sponsored, funded
retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. and many non-U.S. employees.
Benefits are principally based on an employee's years of service and
compensation during employment. The Company's funding policy with respect to the
U.S. plans is to contribute annually the amount required by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are funded in accordance
with local requirements.

</TABLE>

The accumulated benefit obligation approximated the accumulated vested benefit
obligation in 1994 and 1993. The Company used an assumed weighted average
discount rate of 8.0% for 1994 and 8.5% for 1993 and 1992, and a rate of
increase in future compensation levels of 5% in 1994, and 6% for 1993 and 1992
in determining the actuarial present value of the U.S. projected benefit
obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets was 9% in
1994, 1993 and 1992. At June 30, 1994, U.S. plan assets consisted of equity
securities, U.S. treasury obligations, corporate bonds and cash equivalents. For
its non-U.S. plans, the Company used assumed weighted average discount rates
ranging from 7.5% to 10%, and rates of increase in future compensation levels
ranging from 5% to 7% in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets was 11.0%. As of June 30, 1994, non-U.S. plan assets consist of units in
a pooled investment fund.

Certain U.S. employees are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained,
multi-employer pension plans. Contributions and cost are determined in
accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts or terms of the
plans. Pension expense for these plans was $1,006,000, $881,000 and $939,000 in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Employees' Stock Ownership Plan

The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan covering certain salaried
employees. Amounts provided for this plan are approved by the Board of Directors
and for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 aggregated $1,000,000 each
year. 

Profit Improvement Incentive Plan

The Company has a profit improvement incentive plan in which certain officers
and employees participate. Shares under this plan are issued at the discretion
of the Salary and Employee Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors and are
assigned a value equal to a multiple of earnings per share payable in five years
based upon the net increase in earnings per share over the five-year period.
Each fiscal year, amounts are charged or credited to operations to reflect this
liability. Amounts charged to operations for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993
and 1992 were $3,663,000, $3,065,000 and $2,420,000, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The Company sponsors unfunded postretirement medical and life plans covering
certain full time employees who retire and have attained the requisite age and
years of service. Retired employees are required to contribute toward the cost
<PAGE>

of coverage according to various rules established by the Company.
Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires accrual of
postretirement benefits (such as health care and life insurance benefits) during
the years an employee provides services. Prior to adopting this standard, the
Company recorded the cost of these benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The
adoption of SFAS No. 106 increased operating expenses by $639,000 
in 1994. Postretirement benefits paid during 1994 totaled $667,000, while net
postretirement costs recorded in 1994 aggregated $1,306,000 which included
service and interest costs of $119,000 and $741,000, respectively, as well as
$446,000 relating to the amortization of the transition obligation which is
being amortized on a straight line basis over twenty years.
<TABLE>
The following table sets forth the funded status of the Company's postretirement
benefit plans (in thousands):

</TABLE>                                         

The Company used an assumed discount rate of 8% and an initial assumed health
care cost trend rate of 8.5%, declining gradually to an ultimate cost rate of
4.5% for years after 2008. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend
rate would have increased the cost of postretirement health care benefits by 8%
and the accumulated benefit obligation at June 30, 1994 by $726,000.

Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans

cash. These transactions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the
acquired businesses from their respective acquisition dates. The purchase price
of the acquisitions were allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair
value and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $1,220,000. If the
acquisitions had occurred as of July 1, 1991 consolidated results would not have
been materially affected.

Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

The unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended June 30, 1994
and 1993 are set forth on page 14.

Subsequent Event

On August 10, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a subsidiary,
Standex International Engraving GmbH, as of August 31, 1994 for total
consideration of $19.4 million. This transaction is expected to result in a
gain. Net sales of the subsidiary totaled $19.1 million during 1994.

{INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT}

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
of Standex International Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Standex
International Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
related statements of consolidated income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
<PAGE>

material respects, the financial position of Standex International Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
