    PART I

Item 1.   BUSINESS

     WTD Industries, Inc. is a forest products company organized in
Oregon in 1983, whose subsidiaries manufacture softwood and
hardwood lumber, veneer and by-products.  WTD Industries, Inc. and
its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as "WTD" or the
"Company."  The Company markets its products primarily in the
United States and Canada through its subsidiary and sales agent,
TreeSource, Inc.

     The Company and its subsidiaries filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in late January 1991
following extreme adverse conditions in the forest products
industry in 1990.  WTD emerged from  bankruptcy on November 30,
1992 pursuant to the Company's court-approved Second Amended Joint
Plan of Reorganization ("Plan") under which it continues to
operate.


PRODUCTS AND MARKETS

Softwood Lumber

     The Company manufactures a wide variety of softwood lumber
products, predominantly from green (unseasoned) Douglas fir,
hemlock, and white fir.  The Company produces softwood studs in
several species, generally as 2x4 or 2x6 lumber in lengths of 8 to
10 feet.  The Company also makes dimension softwood lumber in a
wide range of widths and thicknesses in lengths from 6 to 26 feet. 
Softwood lumber accounted for 83% of net sales in fiscal 1994, 78%
in fiscal 1993, and 77% in 1992.

     The Company sells softwood lumber to a large number of
customers, primarily distribution centers and wholesalers. 
Softwood lumber is used in a variety of applications, including
residential and commercial construction, packaging, and industrial
uses.

Other Products

     The Company produces a small quantity of hardwood lumber in
sizes targeted principally for the furniture and cabinet
industries.  The Company also has the capacity to produce softwood
veneer, a raw wood, thin-layer product which is peeled from logs
and sold for use in plywood and laminated veneer lumber.  Wood
chips, a by-product of the manufacturing process, are sold
principally to pulp and paper manufacturers.  Wood chips and other
by-products accounted for 11% of net sales in fiscal 1994, 13% in
fiscal 1993, and 16% in fiscal 1992.


Distribution and Marketing

     The Company markets, distributes, and arranges transportation
for its lumber products through its wholly owned subsidiary and
sales agent, TreeSource, Inc.  Through TreeSource, the production
capabilities of individual mills are coordinated to meet a broad
range of customer needs. TreeSource sells primarily through
telephone contacts from its office in Portland, Oregon. 

     Shipments of wood products are generally made by rail or truck
directly from the mill.  The Company also makes regular shipments
by barge from certain of its mills with access to port facilities
to destinations in Southern California and Hawaii.  Exports,
principally to Canada, do not represent a material portion of the
Company's net sales.

     The Company does not attempt to accumulate a large backlog of
orders.  WTD's general practice is to maintain an order file
representing about two to four weeks' production.  The filling of
orders for certain items, however, may require a substantially
longer period of time.  The dollar value of the Company's backlog
of orders at April 30, 1994, was $7.2 million compared to $8.9
million at April 30, 1993.  Backlog on any particular date may not
be indicative of the Company's average backlog, or of net sales or
the backlog for any succeeding period.

     No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company's net sales during fiscal 1994.  The loss of any one
customer would not, in management's opinion, have a material
adverse impact on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

Timber Supply

     The Company generally purchases timber and logs in sufficient
quantities to match the current operating requirements of its
mills.  Management attempts to maintain log inventories equal to an
average of three to four weeks' operating requirements except where
seasonal or weather factors necessitate larger volumes.  The goals
of the Company's procurement strategy are to limit the speculative
aspects of timber purchasing and to maintain the Company's
adaptability to changing lumber market conditions.

     The Company relies mainly on open market log purchases to
supply its raw material needs.  It also purchases timber-cutting
contracts ("timber contracts"), primarily at public timber sales,
and has historically obtained logs to a minor extent from its own
fee timberlands.  As of April 30, 1994, the Company owned a small
amount of fee timberlands in the vicinity of various mills.  The
following table shows the percentages of logs supplied by open
market purchases, timber contracts and fee timberlands, and total
log footage required:

    Year Ended       Open       Timber        Fee        Log
     April 30,      Market     Contracts     Timber  Requirements

     1990            69%        25%            6%    766,000 MBF
     1991            75%        19%            6%    408,000 MBF
     1992            88%         8%            4%    338,000 MBF
     1993            90%         6%            4%    306,000 MBF
     1994            94%         5%            1%    305,100 MBF


     MBF - Thousand Board Feet

     The availability and cost of timber and logs have been, and
should continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors,
including demand by competitors and exporters, the environmental
and harvest policies of federal and state agencies, and, in the
long term, the level of reforestation.  For further discussion of
current industry conditions relating to timber supply, see the
section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."

Employees

     The Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1,250
employees at June 30, 1994.  The Company believes that its
relations with employees are good.  The Company provides its
employees with health insurance, paid holidays and vacation time,
and maintains an IRC 401(k) retirement savings plan.  


Environmental Regulation

     The Company is subject to federal, state and local waste
disposal and pollution control regulations, including air, water
and noise pollution, which have required, and are expected to
continue to require, additional operating and capital expenditures.
The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all
existing regulations and orders.  During fiscal 1994, the Company
incurred expenditures of approximately $600,000 for waste disposal
and pollution control.  Anticipated expenditures for fiscal 1995
are projected to be about $500,000.  Expenditures of about $800,000
are anticipated for fiscal 1996, principally for compliance with
storm water discharge regulations.  It should be noted that various
governmental agencies are considering regulations regarding log
yard management and disposal of log yard waste.  The final
regulations may require material expenditures in the future.


Industry Conditions

     The United States lumber industry is highly sensitive to the
condition of the nation's economy and tends to experience poor
financial results during general economic downturns.  In addition,
sales tend to increase in the spring and summer months and decline
during the fall and winter months in response to seasonal building
construction cycles.  However, in the last two fiscal years,
relatively strong lumber demand occurred in the winter months and
relatively weak demand occurred during the spring months. 
Management believes this situation has occurred because lumber
buyers, concerned about supply in light of public timber harvest
restrictions, have made defensive purchases before the traditional
spring buying period.  In addition, demand in the spring of 1994
was muted by the severe winter conditions in the midwestern and
eastern portions of the U.S.  See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for
further discussion.


Competition

     The wood products industry is highly competitive and includes
a large number of companies manufacturing relatively standardized
products.  The principal means of competition in the lumber
industry are pricing, product quality, and the ability to satisfy
customer needs promptly.  The Company feels it competes effectively
based on the foregoing factors.  Some of WTD's competitors are
large, integrated companies with substantially greater total
resources than those of the Company.  Some of these competitors
have a significant base of low-cost fee timberlands and timber
contracts.  The Company could be at a disadvantage to such
competitors since it relies on the open log market to supply the
bulk of its raw materials requirements.  See the sections entitled
"Timber Supply" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

     During its Chapter 11 proceedings and subsequently, the
Company disposed of most of the assets of 18 facilities.  The

sites in California and Oregon.


Item 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On or about January 30, 1991, WTD Industries, Inc. and each of
its subsidiaries (see Exhibit 21 for list) filed a voluntary
petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code.  The proceeding was filed in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle (the
"Bankruptcy Court").  The jointly administered proceeding is
entitled:  "In re Sedro-Woolley Lumber Co., WTD Industries, Inc.,
TreeSource, Inc., et al.", Case Numbers 91-00707 through 91-00721,
91-00736 through 91-00741, 91-00752 through 91-00756, 91-00773
through 91-00778, and 91-01140 through 91-01149.  The Company's
Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization was confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court on November 23, 1992, effective November 30, 1992.

     A lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of the State of
Washington in and for the County of Thurston on March 4, 1987,
against Cascade West Forest Products, Inc., now operating as
Tumwater Lumber Co. ("Tumwater"), following its acquisition by the
Company through a stock purchase from the sole remaining
shareholder.  The plaintiff, the former majority shareholder of
Tumwater, has alleged that the selling shareholder and Tumwater
breached certain fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff and
committed fraud in connection with the plaintiff's sale of his
Tumwater stock to Tumwater.  The plaintiff seeks damages in an
unspecified amount and placement of the shares of Tumwater stock
previously redeemed by Tumwater into escrow pending resolution of
the dispute.  The selling shareholder has agreed to indemnify the
Company against any liability arising out of the lawsuit. 
Plaintiff has filed a claim with the Bankruptcy Court and the
Company has objected to the claim.  A hearing on the objection has
been stayed pending resolution of the State Court action as to
other parties.  Summary judgment against plaintiff has been granted
as to most of plaintiff's claims.  The matter now is pending before
the Washington Court of Appeals.

     On November 30, 1990, the Company received a tax assessment
from the State of Washington for Business and Occupation (B&O)
taxes in the amount of approximately $900,000, including interest
and penalties.  The Company contested the assessment in the
Bankruptcy Court and by order dated May 19, 1994, the State was
awarded a claim in the amount of $82,868.58, which will be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Company's Plan of Reorganization.  The
order allowing the claim became a final order on May 29, 1994 and
is no longer subject to appeal.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

REORGANIZATION

     The Company and each of its subsidiaries filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on or about January
30, 1991, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
Washington (the "Bankruptcy Court").  On November 23, 1992, WTD's
Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") was
confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.  Distributions under the Plan
commenced November 30, 1992 (the "Effective Date").  An
extraordinary gain on debt restructure of $19.8 million, less a tax
provision of $7.7 million, was recognized in fiscal 1993 as a
result of the distributions.

     As of April 30, 1994, the Company had sold substantially all
of the facilities that were curtailed at the onset of the Chapter
11 proceedings.  The Company intends to dispose of its remaining
idle assets, primarily consisting of real estate, as promptly as
possible.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

     On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the Company's financial results
have and will vary widely, due to seasonal fluctuations and market
factors affecting the demand for logs, lumber and other wood
products.  Therefore, past results for any given year or quarter
are not necessarily indicative of future results.

     The industry is subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings
due to such factors as industry production in relation to product
demand and variations in interest rates and housing starts. 
Currency fluctuations affect the forest products industry when
exchange rates spur log exports and drive up domestic log prices,
and when a relatively strong U.S. dollar encourages imports of
lumber from competing countries.

     The industry is also affected by weather conditions and
changing timber management policies.  Fire danger and excessively
dry or wet conditions temporarily reduce logging activity and may
increase open market log prices.  Timber management policies of
various governmental agencies change from time to time,
periodically causing actual or perceived shortages in some areas. 
These policies change because of environmental concerns, public
agency budget issues and a variety of other reasons.

     It is generally WTD's practice to curtail production at
facilities from time to time due to conditions which temporarily
impair log flow or when imbalances between log costs and product
prices cause the cost of operation to exceed the cost of shutdown. 
Management believes that WTD's labor practices and compensation
systems, as well as a relatively low capital cost in relation to
production capacity, give it the flexibility to curtail operations
and resume production as conditions warrant.  The Company may also
permanently close facilities that are determined to lack future
profit potential under expected operating conditions.

Raw Materials

     Raw materials comprise the majority of the cost of products
sold by the Company.  The Company depends principally on open
market log purchases for its raw materials needs.  WTD's log
inventory policy is to maintain, where possible, a supply equal to
three to four weeks of production.

     During the 1980's, public timber accounted for a significant
portion of the supply used by the forest products industry in the
Pacific Northwest.  On June 22, 1990, the northern spotted owl was
listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a threatened
species in Oregon, Washington and Northern California.  This
required the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) to develop plans to protect the owl's habitat,
primarily in old-growth timber, by limiting timber harvests on
public lands in the Pacific Northwest.  This decision resulted from
many years of controversy and litigation surrounding the harvest of
"old-growth" timber in Oregon, Washington and Northern California. 
Since that time, new controversies surrounding ecosystem management
and species such as the marbled murrelet and various strains of
wild salmon have caused the USFS and BLM to further limit timber
harvests.

     The USFS and BLM have proposed new policies regarding logging
on public lands that would reduce public timber harvests to 20% to
30% of the 1980's harvest levels.  However, implementation of the
USFS and BLM plans have been delayed by industry and
preservationist litigation.  This will extend the period before
implementation can occur, and may require significant changes to
the proposed rules.

     During fiscal years 1992, 1993 and 1994, the Company operated
most of its mills on a one-shift basis, typically using logs
purchased on the open market from industrial and non-industrial
private land owners.  The ability to maintain the present level of
operations at the Company's mills depend on a continuing supply of
logs from these private sources.  The Company's ability to increase
production above present levels would be enhanced by an increased
availability of timber from public lands in the Northwest.

     The sharp reduction in available timber in the Pacific
Northwest has contributed to increased open market log costs.  The
Company has generally been able to obtain sufficient raw materials
for its mills from private sources at prices which ensure a gross
margin.  However, management anticipates that uncertainty
associated with timber supply issues, combined with a continued
lack of public timber sale activity, may contribute to further log
price volatility.  The Company expects that log and lumber markets
will continue to experience rapid changes in values due to actual
and perceived market conditions throughout fiscal 1995, sometimes
resulting in inconsistent relationships between log prices and
lumber prices.  These changes could result in large swings in the
gross margin on lumber produced.  The long term impact of this
issue cannot be predicted at this time.

Comparison of 1994 to 1993

     Net sales for the year ended April 30, 1994 increased by $31.2
million (13 percent) from the year ended April 30, 1993.  This
increase was mainly the result of a 23 percent increase in lumber
prices and a 2 percent increase in lumber production, partially
offset by a 10 percent decline in chip production.  The chip
production decrease from the prior year resulted from improved raw
materials utilization and less whole log chipping activity.

     Gross profit in fiscal 1994 was 8.8 percent of sales versus
8.0 percent of sales in fiscal 1993.  Lumber prices received by the
Company during fiscal 1994 were, on average, 23 percent higher than
in fiscal 1993, while log costs were, on average, 28 percent higher
than in the prior year.  The Company was able to offset some of the
increase in log prices by improving its raw materials utilization
by 2 percent.

     Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the
year ended April 30, 1994 decreased by $0.2 million (1.5 percent)
from those of a year earlier.  This decrease was the result of
ongoing efforts to reduce overhead expenses.  SG&A expenses were
4.5 percent of sales in fiscal 1994 versus 5.1 percent of sales in
fiscal 1993.

     Reorganization credits in fiscal 1994 primarily reflect gains
recognized on the sale of idle assets.  Reorganization charges in
fiscal 1993 primarily reflect professional fees related to the
Chapter 11 proceedings, net of interest income on restricted cash
and changes in reserve accounts.  See Note 2 to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     Interest expense in the year ended April 30, 1994 was $3.7
million above that incurred in the year ended April 30, 1993.  In
accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, the Company did
not accrue interest between January 30, 1991 and November 30, 1992
on unsecured and under-secured instruments.  Interest expense in
fiscal 1993 would have been approximately $3.9 million higher if
interest had been accrued for the entire fiscal year under the
terms of the obligations issued pursuant to the Plan.

     The Company's tax provision in fiscal 1994 was 24 percent of
pretax income, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS Number 109.  In
accordance with APB 11, the Company in fiscal 1993 recorded a tax
provision at statutory rates and an offsetting extraordinary credit
due to net operating loss carryforward utilization.  See Note 6 to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     In fiscal 1993 the Company recognized an extraordinary gain
(before tax effect) on debt restructure of $19.8 million.  See Note
2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Comparison of 1993 to 1992

     Net sales for the year ended April 30, 1993 increased by $33.0
million (15 percent) from the year ended April 30, 1992.  This
increase was mainly the result of a 20 percent increase in lumber
prices, partially offset by a 4 percent decline in lumber
production, an 11 percent decline in chip production, and a 10
percent decline in veneer production.  The production decreases
from the prior year were principally caused by reductions in log
flow at the Company's Philomath operation and less whole log
chipping activity.

Gross profit in fiscal 1993 was 8.0 percent of sales versus 8.7
percent of sales in fiscal 1992.  Lumber prices received by the
Company during fiscal 1993 were, on average, 20 percent higher than
in fiscal 1992, while log costs were, on average, 25 percent higher
than in the prior year.  The Company was able to offset some of the
increase in log prices by improving its raw materials utilization
by 4 percent.

     SG&A expenses in the year ended April 30, 1993 increased by
$0.6 million (5 percent) from those of a year earlier.  This
increase was mainly due to increased payroll expense.  SG&A
expenses were 5.1 percent of sales in fiscal 1993 versus 5.6
percent of sales in fiscal 1992.

     Reorganization charges in fiscal 1993 and 1992 primarily
reflect professional fees related to the Chapter 11 proceedings,
net of interest income on restricted cash and changes in reserve
accounts.  See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Interest expense in the year ended April 30, 1993 was $2.6
million above that incurred in the year ended April 30, 1992.  In
accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, the Company did
not accrue interest between January 30, 1991 and November 30, 1992
on unsecured and under-secured instruments.  Interest expense in
fiscal 1992 and 1993 would have been approximately $6.7 million and
$3.9 million higher, respectively, if interest had been accrued for
all of each fiscal year under the terms of the obligations issued
pursuant to the Plan.

     The Company had no effective tax provision or benefit in the
years ended April 30, 1992 or 1993.  In accordance with APB 11, the
Company recorded a tax provision at statutory rates and an
offsetting extraordinary income credit due to net operating loss
carryforward utilization.  See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

     In fiscal 1993 the Company recognized an extraordinary gain
(before tax effect) on debt restructure of $19.8 million.  This
gain was the result of distributions made to settle the Company's
prepetition claims pursuant to the Plan.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     At April 30, 1994, the Company had net working capital of
$44.8 million, or $5.5 million more than at April 30, 1993.  The
working capital increase was primarily the result of profitable
operations and the sale of certain of the Company's idle
facilities, offset by capital spending, principal payments on long-
term debt, deposits made to secure various long-term obligations,
and dividends paid on the Company's Series A preferred stock.

     Cash and cash equivalents increased by $6.0 million during the
year ended April 30, 1994, to $8.1 million at year-end. 
Approximately $14.5 million of cash was provided by operations,
while another $2.0 million was provided by the sale of idle assets.

About $4.2 million was used to repay various debt obligations, and
$0.9 million was deposited to secure various long-term obligations.

The Company also paid $1.6 million in dividends to its holders of
Series A preferred stock.

     During fiscal 1994, the Company spent $4.1 million for capital
improvements to its facilities.  Capital spending for the year
ending April 30, 1995 is currently projected to be approximately $7
million.  The Company had no material commitments for capital
additions at April 30, 1994.

     The Company does not have a credit facility for working
capital and therefore relies on cash provided by its operations to
fund its working capital needs.  There is no assurance that such
cash will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations. 
Substantially all of the Company's assets are pledged to secure
various debt obligations.

     The Company's Credit and Security Agreement dated as of
November 30, 1992 contains certain covenants, including the
maintenance of prescribed levels of tangible net worth and adjusted
cumulative operating income (as defined).  See Note 5 to
Consolidated Financial Statements.  At April 30, 1994 the Company's
tangible net worth was $17.5 million compared to $8 million
required by the covenant.  At that same date, the Company's
adjusted cumulative operating income was $21.0 million, compared to
$10 million required.  The required level of tangible net worth
increases to $10 million for the period from May 1, 1994 through
April 30, 1995 and $15 million through April 30, 1998.   The
required level of adjusted cumulative operating income increases to
$20 million at August 1, 1994 and $33 million at August 1, 1995. 
During the year ended April 30, 1994, the Company's adjusted
cumulative operating income increased by $14.7 million despite net
income of only $6.3 million.

     The Company has no floating rate debt, but the dividend rate
on its Series A preferred stock varies based on Bank of America's
prime rate in effect at the time the dividends are declared.  Based
on the prime rate in effect at June 30, 1994, annual preferred
dividends would increase by $340,000 from the amount incurred in
the year ended April 30, 1994.

     Employers Insurance of Wausau has advised WTD that it will not
continue its timber bonding agreement with the Company, but will
honor its existing bonds.  The Company is seeking alternate bonding
sources and is currently providing cash deposits in lieu of
bonding.

        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




To the Shareholders
WTD Industries, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WTD
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of April 30,
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income,
cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity, for each of the
years in the three-year period ended April 30, 1994.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of WTD Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 30,
1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April
30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

              WTD INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1  - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Principles of consolidation and operations - The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of WTD Industries, Inc.
and its wholly owned subsidiaries (hereinafter "WTD" or "the
Company").  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

     Temporary cash investments and trade receivables potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk.  The Company
places its temporary cash investments with high credit-quality
financial institutions, and by policy limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one institution.  The Company reviews a customer's
credit history before extending credit and consistently evaluates
its accounts receivable.  Concentrations of credit risk on trade
receivables are limited due to the Company's large number of
customers and their widely varying locations.  Generally, the
Company does not require collateral or other security to support
its trade receivables.

     The Company is engaged in one industry segment, the
manufacture and sale of wood products.  Sales are predominantly in
the United States; export sales are not material.  During the year
ended April 30, 1994, WTD had no sales to any one customer in
excess of 10 percent of net sales.  During the year ended April 30,
1993, the Company had sales to one major customer of $32,162,000,
or 13 percent of net sales.  The loss of any one customer would
not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse impact
on the financial results of the Company.

     WTD has from time to time utilized futures contracts to
minimize the Company's exposure to adverse movements in the log and
lumber markets.  This activity has not been significant in the past
and the Company had no material futures position at April 30, 1994.

     Cash and cash equivalents - Financial instruments with a
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash
equivalents.

     Accounts receivable - Trade accounts receivable are shown net
of allowances for doubtful accounts and discounts of $658,000 and
$639,000 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost is determined using the average cost and first-in,
first-out (FIFO) methods.  A summary of inventory by principal
product classification follows (in thousands):


                                                   APRIL 30,
                                             1994            1993

          Lumber                             13,818           9,515
          Supplies                            1,201           1,238
                                           --------        --------
                                           $ 26,796        $ 18,322
                                           ========        ========


     At April 30, 1994 and 1993, $3,094,000 and $4,671,000,
respectively, of log inventory was valued at market, which
represented reductions of $19,000 and $878,000, respectively, from
cost.  At both April 30, 1994 and 1993, all lumber inventory was
valued at market, which represented reductions of $2,511,000 and
$3,184,000, respectively, from cost.

     Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment
of the Company's facilities are stated at cost.  For financial
reporting purposes, the Company uses the units-of-production method
for computing depreciation over the estimated useful lives of
assets, ranging from ten to thirty years for buildings and
improvements, and three to ten years for machinery and equipment.

     Idle assets - Property, plant and equipment of the Company's
idle facilities are carried at their estimated net realizable
values, including a reserve for estimated holding and disposal
costs.

     Timber and timberlands - Timber and timberlands are stated at
the lower of aggregate cost or estimated disposal value, less the
amortized cost of timber harvested.  The portion of the cost
attributable to standing timber is charged against income as timber
is cut, at rates determined periodically based on the relationship
between unamortized timber value and the estimated volume of
recoverable timber.  The costs of roads and land improvements are
capitalized and amortized over their economic lives.  The Company
classifies timber and timber-related assets as current or long-term
assets based upon expected harvest and disposal plans.

     Timber-cutting contracts - The Company purchases timber under
various types of contracts.  Certain contracts, for which the total
purchase price is fixed, are recorded as assets along with the
related liability at the date acquired.  The remaining contracts,
for which the total purchase price depends on the volume of timber
removed, are considered to be commitments (as discussed in Note 9)
and are not recorded until the timber is removed.

     Income taxes - Income taxes are provided for transactions in
the year in which they are reflected in earnings, even though they
may be reported for tax purposes in a different year.  The
resulting difference between taxes charged to operations and taxes
paid is reported as deferred income taxes.  Tax credits are
recognized in the year utilized, using the flow-through method. 
Effective May 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard Number 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes".  No
gain or loss was recorded as a result of implementing this
pronouncement.  (See Note 6.)


     Net income per common share - This computation is based on net
income less preferred dividends for the period, divided by the
weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and equivalents
assumed to be outstanding during the period.  Anti-dilutive Common
Stock equivalents are excluded from the calculations.  Net income
per common share for the year ended April 30, 1992 has been
restated to reflect a four-for-ten "reverse" common stock split
which occurred on November 30, 1992.  For purposes of primary
earnings per share, weighted average shares of 11,433,000, 
6,166,000 and 2,492,000 were used for the years ended April 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  For purposes of fully diluted
earnings per share, weighted average shares of 11,519,000, 
6,231,000 and 2,492,000 were used for the years ended April 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The weighted average number of
common shares and equivalents for both primary and fully diluted
purposes in the years ended April 30, 1994 and 1993 includes
213,000 and 2,367,000 shares, respectively, assumed from the
potential conversion of Series B preferred stock.


NOTE 2  - REORGANIZATION CHARGES (CREDITS)

     On or about January 30, 1991, the Company and each of its
subsidiaries filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code.  On November 23, 1992, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Western District of Washington (the "Bankruptcy Court")
confirmed the Company's Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization
(the "Plan"), effective November 30, 1992 (the "Effective Date"). 
Under the Plan, the Company discharged substantially all of its
outstanding prepetition liabilities through cash payments,
abandonment of assets, and issuance of replacement debt, Series A
and Series B preferred stock and new Common Stock.  The Company
also recorded a $19.8 million ($12.1 million net of income tax
provision) extraordinary gain on debt restructure as a result of
the Plan.  Existing common shareholders retained 2.5 million
shares, or approximately 57 percent of the outstanding common
shareholder interest after recognition of a four-for-ten "reverse"
common stock split and issuance of 1,868,800 shares of new Common
Stock.  The interest of the original common shareholders will be
further reduced to 22 percent if all Series B preferred stock were
converted into common shares (see Note 7).

     In fiscal 1991, the Company reduced the scope of its
operations.  To reflect this event, management reduced the value of
assets associated with eighteen of the Company's facilities to
estimated net realizable value and established certain reserves for
expenses related to the cost of holding and disposing of such
facilities.  This resulted in reorganization charges of $58 million
in fiscal 1991.  In fiscal years 1992, 1993 and 1994, the Company
sold idle assets and settled obligations at amounts which varied
from their original estimated net realizable amounts. 
Reorganization charges in fiscal years 1992 and 1993 principally
reflect changes made to these estimated amounts, net gains recorded
on the disposal of certain idle assets, and professional fees
associated with the bankruptcy proceedings.  Reorganization credits
in fiscal 1994 primarily related to gains recognized on the sale of
idle facilities at amounts in excess of their originally estimated
net realizable values.  The Company's remaining idle assets are
valued at amounts which management believes approximate their
current net realizable values.

     The Company's debt agreements include covenants for
maintaining specified levels of income, cash flow, working capital,
and collateral coverage.  These agreements also impose certain
restrictions and limitations on capital expenditures, investments,
dividend payments, new indebtedness, and transactions with
officers, directors, shareholders and affiliates.  Included in
these covenants is the requirement to maintain tangible net worth
of $8 million at April 30, 1994, and adjusted cumulative operating
income (as defined) of $10 million.  At April 30, 1994, the
Company's tangible net worth and adjusted cumulative operating
income were $17.5 million and $21.0 million, respectively.  These
debt covenants contain escalation provisions in fiscal 1995 and
over the term of the agreement.  At May 1, 1994, the tangible net
worth covenant increases to $10 million.  The adjusted cumulative
operating income covenant increases to $20 million at August 1,
1994, and $33 million at August 1, 1995.  During the year ended
April 30, 1994, the Company's adjusted cumulative operating income
increased by $14.7 million despite net income of only $6.3 million.


     In accordance with the Company's agreements associated with
its senior secured debt, mandatory additional prepayments are
required if the Company's cumulative operating income exceeds
certain specified amounts. No such prepayment will be required for
the year ended April 30, 1994.

NOTE 6  - PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

     Effective May 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) Number 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  This statement mandates the asset and liability
approach to determining income tax provision or benefit.  Deferred
income tax benefits and liabilities are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences in the carrying value of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS Number 109 as of
May 1, 1993 was not material.  The Company's prior year financial
statements have not been restated for the provisions of this
pronouncement.  The federal and state income tax provision consists
of the following (in thousands):

     The fiscal 1993 and 1992 tax provisions were calculated at
statutory rates and the estimated benefits of net operating loss
(NOL) carryforwards were recognized as extraordinary items.  The
tax benefit of NOL carryforwards in fiscal 1993 includes $7.7
million associated with the extraordinary gain on debt restructure.

     The income tax provision in fiscal 1993 and 1992 differs from
the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate
principally as a result of state income taxes.  The income tax
provision in fiscal 1994 differs from the amount computed by
applying the federal statutory rate principally as a result of
recognizing the tax benefits of NOL carryforwards.

     SFAS Number 109 requires that all current deferred tax assets
and liabilities be grouped and reported as one amount and that all
noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities be grouped and
reported as one amount.   Classification as current or noncurrent
is based upon the classification of the related asset or liability
for financial reporting.  For deferred tax amounts that do not
relate to an asset or liability for financial reporting,
classification is to be based upon the expected utilization.  At
April 30, 1994, deferred tax assets and liabilities were comprised
of the following (in thousands):

     Current Deferred Tax Assets:
     Non-deductible accruals                           $  1,953
     Reserves for doubtful accounts and discounts           244
     Tax benefit of net operating loss carryforward      11,028
     Valuation allowance against tax benefit of net
      operating loss carryforward                       (11,028)
                                                       --------

     Non-Current Deferred Tax Liabilities:
     Differences in depreciation and capitalization
      of assets for financial reporting and tax
      purposes                                           (2,181)
                                                       --------

                                                       ========

     The Company has NOL carryforwards of approximately $27 million
for regular federal income tax, $25 million for alternative minimum
tax and $28 million for state tax purposes.  These net operating
losses will expire in 2006 and 2007.  As a result of the Company's
reorganization as discussed in Note 2, the amount of NOL which can
be utilized is limited to approximately $3.3 million in fiscal 1994
and $2.3 million in each succeeding year.  While management
believes that some or all of the NOL carryforwards will be utilized
in future periods, the volatility of the Company's operating
environment and a desire to be conservative in the adoption of SFAS
Number 109 has resulted in the recognition of a valuation allowance
for the full amount of the future benefit associated with NOL
carryforwards.


NOTE 7  - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     Stockholders' equity at April 30, 1994 consists of the
following:

     Series A preferred stock, $100 per share liquidation
preference; 500,000 shares authorized; 269,636 shares issued and
outstanding, limited voting rights; cumulative dividends payable
quarterly in advance at the prime rate, with a minimum rate of 6%
and a maximum rate of 9%; convertible into Common Stock at $7.50
per share after April 30, 1999; redeemable at original issue price
plus any accrued dividends at the option of the Board of Directors,
in the form of cash or in exchange for senior unsecured debt with
12% coupon.  The holders of the Series A preferred stock will be
granted voting control of the Company's Board of Directors in the
event the Company misses three consecutive quarterly dividend
payments, four quarterly dividend payments within twenty-four
months or a total of eight quarterly dividend payments.

     Series B preferred stock, $100 per share liquidation
preference; 500,000 shares authorized; 6,111 shares issued and
outstanding; limited voting rights; convertible into 212,693 
shares of Common Stock; dividends payable only if paid on the
Company's Common Stock; redeemable at original issue price plus
accrued dividends at the option of the Board of Directors after all
Series A preferred stock has been redeemed.

     Common Stock, no par value; 40,000,000 shares authorized;
11,061,074 shares issued and outstanding.  Before giving effect to
any shares that might be issued pursuant to the management
incentive stock option plan or conversion of any Series A preferred
stock, the total number of common shares would increase to
11,273,767 shares if the remaining outstanding Series B preferred
stock is converted to Common Stock.


NOTE 8  - STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     All then-outstanding options under the Company's Stock Option
Plan ("Option Plan") were canceled effective October 1, 1992. 
Effective December 30, 1992, the Option Plan was amended and
restated, and new options were granted.  Non-qualified stock
options may be granted to directors, independent contractors,
consultants, and employees, and incentive stock options may be
granted to employees, to acquire up to 1,245,900 shares of Common
Stock.  Options may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years
and are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.  The Option Plan terminates on July 11, 1996, or
such earlier time as the Board of Directors may determine.  The
Option Plan provides for incremental vesting based upon the
optionee's period of service with the Company and is administered
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

     Following is a summary of the activity with respect to the
Option Plan for the year ended April 30, 1994:

     Options for 354,700 shares remain available for grant.  The
balance of the options will have an exercise price of the greater
of $3.00 per share or an amount per share determined by the Plan
Administrator, but not less than 85 percent of the fair market
value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant.

     The Company maintains a weekly discretionary bonus program for
its mill workers based on the performance of each production shift
at individual mills.  The bonus program for mill workers is
designed to reward productivity, safety and regular attendance. 
The Company also has a monthly discretionary profit sharing bonus
program for management and administrative employees.  Profit
sharing bonuses are based on net pre-tax profits and are generally
allocated according to base salary level.  Amounts paid under all
bonus programs were approximately $8,500,000, $7,400,000, and
$7,800,000 in fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     The Company maintains a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan.  Under
the plan, eligible participants may contribute 2 percent to 20
percent of their compensation.  The Company matches contributions
of employees participating in the Production/Safety/Attendance
Bonus program on a monthly basis in an amount as determined from
time to time by the Board of Directors.  Salaried employees are not
generally entitled to matching contributions.  During the years
ended April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 the Company incurred expenses
for matching contributions and plan administration of $391,000;
$402,000; and $338,000; respectively.  Company contributions to
this plan are funded on a current basis.

NOTE 9  - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     (a)  Timber commitments - At April 30, 1994, the Company had
contracts to purchase approximately 26 MMBF of timber from the U.S.
Forest Service and others for an estimated stumpage cost of $9.3
million.  Deposits were made on these contracts and additional
payments are required as timber is removed.  The Company intends to
harvest the remaining timber under these contracts prior to April
30, 1995.

     (b)  Leases - At April 30, 1994, the Company had future
minimum rental commitments for new or assumed operating leases as
follows:  1995 - $950,000; 1996 - $779,000; 1997 - $317,000; 1998
- - - - $253,000; 1999 - $245,000; thereafter - $292,000.

     Total rental expense for all leases was $1,131,000, $1,199,000
and $1,219,000 for the years ended April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Actual rental expense includes short-term rentals
and leases shorter than one year, which are not included in the
commitments.

     (c)  Litigation - On November 30, 1990, the Company received
a tax assessment from the State of Washington for Business and
Occupation (B&O) taxes in the amount of approximately $900,000,
including interest and penalties.  The tax was assessed against
TreeSource, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary which acts as the
Company's sales agent, based on sales made by TreeSource on behalf
of the Company's Washington mills.  B&O taxes were in fact paid by
the Company's Washington mills on their sales.  On May 19, 1994,
the Court ordered that TreeSource's liability under this assessment
was approximately $83,000.  This liability is fully reflected in
the Company's financial statements, and will be discharged pursuant
to the Company's Plan of Reorganization.

     Certain claims arising from the Company's reorganization have
not been settled.  A reserve of $290,000 was included as a current
liability at April 30, 1994 to reflect the aggregate estimated
liability of such claims.

     The Company is involved in other litigation primarily arising
in the normal course of its business.  In the opinion of
management, the Company's liability, if any, under such pending
litigation will not have a material impact upon the Company's
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.


NOTE 10 - NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     In the year ended April 30, 1992, WTD abandoned one of its
idle facilities and certain machinery to the secured lenders of
such assets.  At the same time, the Company offset corresponding
claims for debt and accrued interest of approximately $688,000.

     In connection with the Company's reorganization, certain of
the Company's liabilities were discharged in fiscal 1993 through
the issuance of various debt and equity securities with a market
value of $101.1 million.

     These transactions affected the financial position of the
Company but did not directly affect its cash flow during the
periods presented.

NOTE 11 - UNAUDITED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following quarterly information for the years ended April
30, 1994 and 1993 is unaudited but includes all adjustments (which
consist of normal recurring adjustments) which management considers
necessary for a fair presentation of such information (in
