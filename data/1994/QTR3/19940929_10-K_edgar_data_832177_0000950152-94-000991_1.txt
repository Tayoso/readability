ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

         Riser Foods, Inc. ("Riser" or the "Company") was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on December 18, 1987.  The Company and its
subsidiaries are engaged in the distribution of groceries and related items
through its retail supermarket subsidiary, Rini-Rego Supermarkets, Inc., and
its wholesale subsidiary, American Seaway Foods, Inc.  All references to Riser
or the Company include Riser and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Retail Supermarket Operations
- - -----------------------------
         As of July 2, 1994 the Company operated 42 stores in the greater
Cleveland area, 40 of which operate under the "Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop" format,
one as an "Apple's Supermarket" and one as a "Jax Deep Discounts and
Closeouts".

         The Company's merchandising strategy is to offer a broad selection of
quality products at competitive prices with an emphasis on superior customer
service, quality and convenience.  The Company sells most nationally known
brands of merchandise, regional brands and a variety of private label products.
The private label products are generally sold at prices lower than those of
nationally known products.

         The Company-owned retail stores offer a large selection of food items,
including dry groceries, meat, dairy, produce and frozen foods, as well as a
number of non-food items such as greeting cards and health and beauty care
items.  Many of the Company's stores also contain specialty departments such as
delicatessens, in-store bakeries, and certain locations offer "fresh to go"
prepared foods, service meat, service seafood, floral and general merchandise
departments.  Services including, video tape rental, pharmacies, banking and
debit and credit card payment options are also available in certain locations.

         During the past fiscal year, the Company introduced its "Marketplace"
format with the opening of three new or expanded supermarket locations. The
Company's Marketplace stores are larger than the Company's conventional stores,
ranging in size from approximately 60,000 to 70,000 square feet, and feature
updated decor packages and fixturing with broader selections of traditional
merchandise and additional emphasis on fresh, high quality perishables,
prepared food items and a variety of service departments such as one-hour photo
processing and full service in-store banking.  The Company is currently in the
process of converting two of its conventional Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop stores to
the Marketplace format.





                                       2
<PAGE>   4
         Advertising and promotion are important factors in the Company's
merchandising strategy.  The Company's stores affiliated with the Association
of Stop-N-Shop Supermarkets, an association of independent grocery retailers
established as a cooperative advertising and purchasing organization
("Stop-N-Shop Association"), advertise primarily through joint advertisements.
The Stop-N-Shop Association advertises in newspapers, circulars, and television
and radio advertising comparable to the other supermarket companies which
operate in the northeast Ohio market area.  This advertising generally features
high demand products at competitive prices.

         The Company acquired two supermarket locations in May 1994 and one
supermarket location in June 1994 from an unaffiliated company.  Two of these
locations are currently operated by the Company and a sale is pending to a
wholesale customer for one location.  In connection with the opening of these
two larger stores, (82,000 and 75,000 square feet) the Company closed three
smaller stores as part of the Company's long range retail restructuring plan
which, in general, involves the closing of certain underperforming smaller
outdated retail stores and replacing them with fewer larger stores operated by
the Company or its wholesale customers.

Wholesale Operations
- - --------------------
         The Company operates one of the largest wholesale grocery distribution
operations in the Midwest doing business as "Seaway".  The Company supplies
national brand, regional brand and private label products to Company-owned
stores, other independently-owned retail grocery chains and independent grocers
in northeastern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania.

         The Company is continually in the process of expanding its wholesale
customer base by upgrading its available product lines to include a wider
assortment of grocery, frozen foods, dairy, meat, produce and bakery items.
The Company offers its wholesale customers a wide variety of operational
support services which include advertising, promotion, marketing and
merchandising services, retail operations counseling, and technical and
information systems support.  In addition, the Company assists wholesale
customers in the upgrading and/or enlargement of their stores by providing
inventory and equipment financing, store layout, equipment planning and design,
and engineering and construction services.

         The Company utilizes an on-line computerized buying and inventory
control system for the purchase and sale of its inventory.  The Company
purchases the majority of its products from large, national manufacturers of
consumer foods and grocery-related products and the remainder of its products
from several other suppliers.  The Company is also a member of several
purchasing cooperatives which provide the Company with enhanced purchasing





                                       3
<PAGE>   5
opportunities and assistance with the development of its private label program.

         In August 1993, the Company purchased from an unaffiliated company
certain inventory, equipment and a warehouse facility which it now uses in the
operation of its own health and beauty care/general merchandise ("HBC/GM")
distribution facility.  This facility supplies the Company-owned retail stores,
other independently-owned retail grocery chains, independent grocers and a mass
merchandising chain.

         The Company also operates the Eagle Ice Cream Company, which
manufactures branded ice cream and distributes purchased ice cream and novelty
products to Company-owned retail stores, other independently-owned retail
grocery chains, independent stores and a national food service distribution
company.

         Consistent with the industry practices of other food distribution
retailers and wholesalers, the Company maintains inventory levels at its
distribution centers and retail locations at levels which minimize out of stock
products for its customers.  The Company permits the return of damaged or
defective products from customers.

Competition
- - -----------
         The supermarket industry is highly competitive.  During the past
several years, competition in the northeast Ohio market area has been extremely
intense due in part to a stagnant or declining consumer population and the
entry of a number of significant new competitors.  The Company estimates that
it is one of the largest retailers, in terms of grocery sales, in the northeast
Ohio market area.

         Company-owned retail stores principally compete with regional
supermarket chains and voluntary supermarket associations.  The Company also
competes with warehouse/wholesale clubs, convenience stores, deep discount drug
stores and general merchandise stores that also sell grocery products.  The
principal areas of competition pertain to price, selection and quality of
perishables and other food products, customer service and store location.

         In addition to competition from two national "price-cutting"
competitors, which operate superstores containing grocery departments and
conventional supermarkets in the northeast Ohio market, the Company may
encounter competition from a regional company which has announced plans to
develop superstores containing grocery departments in the area.  These
companies compete with the Company-owned stores at the retail level and the
Company's wholesale customers on the wholesale level.





                                       4
<PAGE>   6
         Since demographic trends reflect a shift in consumer population from
those heavy-industry based regions of the U.S., like northeastern Ohio, to
service oriented and sun-belt regions, the Company must continually emphasize
customer service and value to maintain its market share and compensate for the
lack of population growth in the Company's market area.

         The wholesale food distribution industry is also highly competitive in
the market area served by the Company.  Management believes that the principal
competitive factors include price, breadth of product line and the availability
of support services to its wholesale customers.  The Company competes directly
with  regional and national wholesalers.

Corporate Background
- - --------------------
         Riser was formed to act as the parent holding company in connection
with the combination of Fisher Foods, Inc. ("Fisher"), Rini Holding Company
("Rini"), Rego Supermarkets, Inc. ("Rego"), and American Seaway Foods, Inc. and
two of its affiliated partnerships ("Seaway"), through the exchange of Riser
stock for the stock of Fisher, Rini, Rego and Seaway, and a merger which was
effective June 8, 1988 (the "Combination").  Following the Combination, the
Company consolidated the wholesale operations of Seaway and Fisher into one
operating unit and consolidated its retail operations through the merger of
Rini and Rego into Fisher and changed Fisher's name to Rini-Rego Supermarkets,
Inc.

         In connection with the Company's sale of certain assets of its food
service division in May 1992, the Company purchased for $9,000,000 a portion of
the former Seaway warehouse complex which the Company had leased from Seaway
Development Company ("Seaway Development"), an Ohio general partnership whose
partners were shareholders of Seaway prior to the Combination.  Simultaneously
with the purchase of this complex, the Company resold this property along with
certain assets of the Company's food service division for $11,750,000 to Sysco
Food Services of Cleveland, Inc.

Employees
- - ---------
         As of July 2, 1994, the Company employed approximately 5,000 persons,
on both a full and part-time basis.  The majority of the Company's work force
is unionized and are members of either the United Food and Commercial Workers
Union, Local No. 880 (retail) ("Local 880") or the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, Local No. 507 (wholesale) ("Local 507").  The Company's contract
with Local 880, which is negotiated through the Cleveland Food Industry
Committee whose members include other members of the Stop-N-Shop Association
and the Company's primary competitors, First National Supermarkets, Inc. and
Heinen's, is in effect until September 8, 1996.  A contract between the Company
and Local 507 which expired on April 1, 1994 has been extended indefinitely
during the pendency





                                       5
<PAGE>   7
of contract renegotiations.  This contract can be terminated by Local 507 upon
seven days' notice.  Wholesale operations have not been negatively impacted by
this situation.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         Riser owns a warehouse and office facility in Bedford Heights, Ohio
containing approximately 850,000 square feet which serves as the Company's
corporate headquarters and principal distribution center.  The Company also
owns the following properties:  a warehouse, office facility and garage in
Maple Heights, Ohio containing approximately 356,000 square feet, approximately
349,000 square feet of which is used in its HBC/GM operations and approximately
7,000 square feet is subleased to an unaffiliated company; a warehouse and
office facility in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio containing approximately 187,000
square feet of which approximately 140,000 square feet is leased to others and
the remainder used in its wholesale operations and an ice cream plant in
Bedford, Ohio containing approximately 39,000 square feet.  A warehouse
facility owned by the Company in Cleveland, Ohio containing approximately
68,200 square feet is currently leased by an unaffiliated party which has
notified the Company that it intends to exercise its  option to purchase such
facility in fiscal 1995.  The Company leases approximately 305,000 square feet
of a warehouse facility in Bedford Heights, Ohio, 245,000 square feet of which
is subleased to unaffiliated parties.

         Five retail store properties are owned by the Company through its
Rini-Rego Supermarkets, Inc. subsidiary.  Most of the Company's leased
properties are under long-term leases of varying terms, the majority of which
obligate the Company to pay certain increases in property taxes and insurance
and to pay additional rent based on a percentage of sales at that particular
location.  As of July 2, 1994, the aggregate minimum annual rentals of all
operating and capital leases with initial noncancellable terms of more than one
year were approximately $18,635,000.

       The Company's results of operations for the past three fiscal years are
indicative of the pressures that many food distributors face under the current
economic climate.  The food distribution industry has encountered little or no
inflation over the past three years while operating costs, particularly labor
and occupancy, have contractually risen.  This, coupled with increased
competition from non-traditional sources, has squeezed overall industry
operating margins.

       The Company's primary market area, northeast and central Ohio and
western Pennsylvania, has seen new non-union competitors enter the marketplace
which has negatively impacted both Company-owned retail store sales and sales
to independently-owned retail stores.  The Company has been able to more than
offset sales declines attributed to competition with additional sales gained as
a result of the acquisition of a new health and beauty care/general merchandise
(HBC/GM) distribution facility and the expansion of its wholesale distribution
territory.

Net Sales
- - ---------
       Net sales increased 1.2% to $1.122 billion in 1994, 13.2% to $1.108
billion in 1993 and decreased 4.2% to $.979 billion in 1992.  Sales in 1993
included an extra week of sales giving that year two Fourth of July sell-weeks.
The Company has embarked on programs to enhance its overall sales.  These
programs include consolidation and modernization of Company-owned retail
distribution points and expansion of sales to independently-owned retail
stores.  The following details the number of Company-owned retail stores over
the last three years:

</TABLE>

       Adjusted for the 53rd week of sales in 1993, sales to
independently-owned retail stores rose 13.9% in 1994, 40.3% in 1993 and
declined 3.1% in 1992.  Sales declines in 1992 were attributed to the general
economic climate in the Company's primary market area.  Sales increases in 1993
were primarily attributed to new customers gained as a result of a major
competitor closing its northeast Ohio distribution center in the spring of
1992.  This offset the loss of sales attributed to the Company's closing of its
food service distribution center, also in the spring of 1992.  Sales increases
in 1994 were primarily due to new customers and expanded product lines
resulting from the Company's acquisition of an HBC/GM distribution facility
from its former HBC/GM supplier.

       The Company is continuing to seek new wholesale customers, many of whom
are outside existing distribution channels, to expand its distribution
territory.  The Company also seeks to increase sales to existing wholesale
customers by increasing perishable and HBC/GM sales penetration.  Concurrent
with the acquisition of the HBC/GM distribution facility, the Company began
servicing approximately 150 Hills Department Stores throughout the eastern
third of the United States.

       Total sales in Company-owned retail stores have declined in each of the
last three years because of same-store sales declines and less units in
operation in each year.  Adjusted for the 53rd week of sales in 1993, total
sales in Company-owned retail stores declined 5.4% in 1994, 5.3% in 1993 and
4.8% in 1992.  During that same period, same-store sales also declined; .39% in
1994, 2.6% in





                                       10
<PAGE>   12
1993 and 4.7% in 1992.  Same-store sales declines in Company owned retail
stores are primarily attributed to increased competition, particularly
non-union and non-traditional grocery retailers.  Contributing to the Company's
same-store sales declines is an overall lack of inflation related to food
products, with certain categories experiencing deflation.

       Programs to remodel and remerchandise Company-owned retail stores have
been successful at increasing same-store sales in these locations and such
programs are continuing.  The Company plans to have a core group of 35 to 40
new or newly remodeled Company-owned retail stores by the end of fiscal 1997.

Gross Profit
- - ------------
       Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, declined in each of the last
three years: 21.69% in 1992, 19.53% in 1993 and 19.27% in 1994.  These
decreases reflect the Company's shift in sales mix from sales in Company-owned
retail stores to sales to independently-owned retail stores.  Sales to
independently-owned retail stores carry a lower gross profit percentage than
sales in Company-owned retail stores.  The percentage of Company sales
generated by sales to independently-owned retail stores has grown from 35.3% in
1992, to 44.7% in 1993 and 49.4% in 1994.

       The Company has been able to maintain both retail and wholesale gross
profit percentages despite recent competitive pressures.  During the third
quarter of 1994, the Company's primary retail competitor initiated a price
reduction program targeted at certain retail sales categories.  Although this
strategy was targeted principally at warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores,
it has impacted the Company's retail gross profits.  The impact of this pricing
strategy was to lower overall retail gross profits within the northeast Ohio
market.

       The Company has been able to mitigate the impact of these factors on its
gross profits through remerchandising Company-owned retail stores and improved
buying opportunities resulting from its increased wholesale customer base.  The
Company's provision for Last-in, First-out (LIFO) inventories was as follows
over the last three years:  income of $486,000, in 1994 and expense of $211,000
and $988,000, in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  This decrease in the Company's
LIFO provision is due to lack of inflation and the lowering of certain LIFO
inventory levels.





                                       11
<PAGE>   13
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
- - ---------------------------------------------------
       SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, also declined in each of the
last three years: 19.54% in 1992, 17.60% in 1993 and 17.35% in 1994.  These
decreases again reflect the shift in sales mix to independent retail customers.
While providing lower gross profits, these sales also require lower SG&A
expenses.  Additionally, the Company-owned retail stores which were closed
between years operated at relatively higher SG&A percentages and their
disposition benefited the Company's overall SG&A percentage.  These trends
offset the impact of increased labor and occupancy costs in the Company's
operating stores.

Restructuring Charge
- - --------------------
       The Company has recorded charges in the last three years reflecting
costs associated with the Company's long range strategic plans to restructure
its Company-owned retail store operations.  These plans included the
disposition of non-core stores, increased capital expenditures to expand and/or
modernize core stores (Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop) and the consolidation of certain
Company owned retail store locations in larger retail facilities.

       In 1994, the Company recorded a $12 million restructuring charge to
account for its store consolidation plan.  This charge included a $4 million
non-cash charge to write down net assets to their net realizable value and $8
million charge for future cash expenditures, principally occupancy costs net of
expected sublease income related to the closing of five stores in fiscal 1994
and plans to close nine additional Company-owned retail stores over the next
three to four years.  This reflected the Company's plan to close and
consolidate Company-owned retail stores replacing them with new or expanded
Company-owned retail stores or new or remodeled stores to be operated by
independently-owned wholesale customers.  The plan will replace approximately
456,000 square feet of small, outdated retail locations with 431,000 square
feet of new, modernized facilities.  The Company's plan is to operate
approximately 35 to 40 expanded or newly remodeled Company-owned retail stores
by the end of fiscal 1997 which is expected to result in a limited reduction of
overall employee levels.

       The Company also acquired two grocery store locations in May 1994 from a
competitor which was exiting the Cleveland market.  These locations (82,000 and
75,000 square feet) met the Company's long range strategic plan of operating
larger stores.  The stores were converted to Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop stores and
replaced three small, outdated Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop stores closed in
conjunction with this acquisition.  Additionally, the Company also closed a
small, outdated Company-owned retail store which was replaced by a new, larger
store operated by an independently-owned wholesale customer and one other
non-Rini-Rego store.





                                       12
<PAGE>   14
       The $5 million restructuring charge recorded in 1993 reflected the
Company's plan to dispose of other non-core store formats.  The 1993 charge
included a $1.8 million non-cash charge to write down net assets to their net
realizable value and a $3.8 million charge for future cash expenditures,
principally occupancy costs net of expected sublease income and pension
withdrawal liabilities.  The Company decided to close its remaining five Carl's
stores in the Akron-Canton area along with a former Carl's location.  The
Company also declined to renew its lease on a Food Centre location.  The
Company was able to sell four of the Akron-Canton locations to
independently-owned wholesale customers who now operate the locations under the
Apple's name.  Overall employee levels were reduced as a result of the
Company's decision to exit the Akron-Canton market.

       The 1992 restructuring charge reflected the costs, primarily expected
future cash expenditures for occupancy costs, associated with the closing of
one of the Company's former Carl's locations.

       Taken as a whole, the Company's restructuring charges reflect the
Company's overall plan to restructure its Company-owned retail stores focusing
on its core-store format.  This restructuring included the disposition of
non-core stores and expansion and consolidation of its Rini-Rego stores.  The
Company does not currently anticipate any future restructuring charges.

Interest Expense, Net
- - ---------------------
       Interest expense, net, increased $646,000 to $7.0 million in 1994 and
$82,000 to $6.4 million in 1993 after declining $1.6 million to $6.3 million in
1992.  The 1992 decline was primarily attributed to lower debt levels due to
scheduled debt repayments and a reduction in the bank's prime rate.  Increases
in 1994 and 1993 are attributed to planned increased borrowings required to
fund the Company's capital expenditure programs and fluctuations in the bank's
prime rate.  The bank's prime rate at the end of each of the last four years
was as follows:  1991-8.50%, 1992-6.00%, 1993-6.00% and 1994-7.25%.  The
Company earned .25% interest rate reductions in 1993 and 1992.   The Company's
current borrowing rate under its bank credit facility is prime plus .5%

Income Taxes
- - ------------
       The Company provided taxes at an effective tax rate of 37.0% in 1994,
38.3% in 1993 and 40.9% in 1992.  The lowering of the Company's effective tax
rate represents a lower provision for state income taxes associated with the
Company's lower book income.  The Company accounts for the franchise tax
portion of the Company's state income tax provision as an operating expense.

Accounting Change
- - -----------------
       The Company currently accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (SFAS No. 109).  This statement requires that the liability method of
accounting for income taxes be used rather than the deferred method previously
used.  The Company adopted the provision of SFAS No. 109 in 1994.  The Company
elected not to restate prior year's financial statements and recorded the
cumulative effect of the accounting change.  As a result, the Company has
recorded a one-time income item of $6.9 million to reflect the cumulative
effect of the change in accounting for income taxes.  The one-time income item
is principally the result of benefiting the expected utilization of tax net
operating loss carryforwards (NOL) and the adjustment of deferred tax balances
to reflect changes in statutory rates.  See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a further discussion.

Extraordinary Item
- - ------------------
       The Company recorded an extraordinary income item of $253,000 in 1993
benefiting a portion of its pre-acquisition NOL.  In prior years, utilization
of its pre-acquisition NOL was used to reduce the values assigned to
non-current assets in purchase accounting.  In 1993, a portion of the
pre-acquisition NOL was used to write-off the remaining values assigned to
non-current assets in purchase accounting with the remainder benefited as an
extraordinary item.  The amount of utilization of NOL was $627,000 in 1994,
$736,000 in 1993 and $1,541,000 in 1992.  See Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

       The Company's primary source of capital has traditionally come from
internally generated funds.  Greater working capital requirements associated
with higher levels of capital expenditures, the Company's HBC/GM acquisition
and new wholesale customer financing increased the Company's utilization of its
bank credit facilities during 1994.

       Operating activities generated $13.6 million of cash, compared to $16.5
million in 1993 and $26.1 million in 1992.  This decrease is attributed to
lower earnings between years coupled with increased working capital
requirements.  Net income of $8.6 million contained a non-cash credit related
to the adoption of SFAS No. 109 of $6.9 million and included non-cash charges
for depreciation and amortization of $14.8 million and a restructuring charge
of $12 million.  Significant balance sheet changes included decreases in
accounts payable of $1.6 million and increases in accounts and notes receivable
of $6.7 million and FIFO inventories of $1.3 million.

       The food distribution industry requires a significant investment in
receivables and inventories to meet customer needs.  Increased levels of
inventory were required to support the new HBC/GM distribution facility and
forward buy opportunities.  Additional wholesale customer financing was also
made available to support the acquisition by two independently-owned wholesale
customers of four former Company-owned retail stores in the Akron-Canton area.
Increased retail store size associated with Company programs to remodel and
expand existing retail locations also increased working capital requirements.

       Working capital, exclusive of deferred income taxes, increased from
$24.3 million at the end of 1993 to $36.4 million at the end of 1994.  The
Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities, exclusive of deferred
income taxes, increased from 1.26:1 at the end of 1993 to 1.43:1 at the end of
1994.  These increases reflect the increased working capital demands noted
above.

       The Company's ratio of liabilities to equity decreased from 3.14:1 at
the end of 1993 to 2.98:1 at the end of 1994.  This ratio was favorably
impacted by the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 109.

       The Company utilized $27.1 million of 1994 cash flow for capital
expenditures.  This amount is comparable to 1993 and 1992 levels of capital
expenditures and reflect Company programs to enhance its retail core-store
format ($22.3 million), upgrade its data processing systems and equipment ($1.4
million), acquire a warehouse facility and improve distribution equipment ($3.4
million)

       Retail capital expenditures were made to acquire, modernize and expand
retail locations.  At the end of 1994, the Company operated 42 retail locations
compared to 45 retail locations at the same time last year.  During 1994, the
Company acquired three new retail locations, of which sale is pending on one
store to a wholesale customer, and closed five other Company-owned stores.  The
stores which were closed continue the Company's plans to focus on its
core-store format.

       The level of capital expenditures for 1995 is expected to be slightly
higher than the 1994 level.  The Company plans to expand or remodel six
Company-owned retail stores during 1995.  Additionally, the Company is
required, pursuant to the terms of its leases, to purchase its Aurora Road
warehouse facility and Cash-N-Carry branch in June 1995.  The Company believes
that cash flow from operations and the unused portion of the bank credit
facilities will supply adequate funds for planned capital expenditures, normal
ongoing business activities, and debt principal repayments.  Available unused
borrowing capacity under the Company's bank credit facility was approximately
$10.1 million at the end of 1994.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

       Inflation increases the Company's major costs inventory and labor.
Because of the high velocity of inventory turnover in the food distribution
industry and the Company's use of the LIFO valuation method for a majority of
its inventory, the impact of inflation is normally reflected very quickly in
results of operations.  The impact of inflation on cost of sales has been
relatively insignificant in recent years.  Experience indicates that highly
competitive market conditions may prevent the Company from fully recovering
inflation-driven costs through retail pricing alone.

                    Report of Independent Public Accountants

To Riser Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

       We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RISER
FOODS, INC. (a Delaware corporation) AND SUBSIDIARIES as of July 2, 1994 and
July 3, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
July 2, 1994.  These financial statements and the schedules referred to below
are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.

       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Riser Foods, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994, and July 3, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended July 2, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

       As explained in Note 4 to the financial statements, effective July 4,
1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes as required
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.

       Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedules contained in Note 14 to
the financial statements are presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not a required part of the
basic financial statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and,
in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.

         SEGMENT INFORMATION -- Riser Foods, Inc. (Riser or the Company) is
engaged in one business segment, the food distribution industry.  The Company
distributes national brand and private label products through Company-owned and
other independently-owned retail stores throughout northeast and central Ohio
and western Pennsylvania.  The Company operates 42 retail locations in
northeast Ohio.  The following is a detail of the number of Company-owned
stores by year:

</TABLE>

         PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Riser and its subsidiaries.  All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

         FISCAL YEAR -- The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest
to June 30.  Fiscal 1994 consists of the 52 weeks ended July 2, 1994.  Fiscal
1993 consists of the 53 weeks ended July 3, 1993.  Fiscal 1992 consists of the
52 weeks ended June 27, 1992.

         CASH EQUIVALENTS -- The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

         INVENTORIES-- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined through the use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for
a majority of consolidated inventories:  72% at July 2, 1994 and 83% at July 3,
1993.  The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method is used to determine cost for the
remaining inventories which consist principally of perishable products and
warehouse health and beauty care and general merchandise products.





                                       31
<PAGE>   33
         If the FIFO method had been used to determine cost for all Company
inventories, total inventories would have been higher than reported by
approximately $6,383,000 at July 2, 1994 and $6,869,000 at July 3, 1993.

         PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITAL LEASES-- Property and equipment are
recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method at annual rates
sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets during their estimated useful
lives.  Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes.
Amortization of property under capital leases is computed using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the
term of the lease.  The following range of depreciable lives are used:

                 Buildings and Improvements        19 to 40 years
                 Leasehold Improvements             5 to 20 years
                 Equipment                          3 to 15 years

         SELF INSURANCE RESERVES -- The Company is primarily self insured for
property loss, general liability costs and workers' compensation.  Estimated
costs of these self insurance programs are accrued at current cost based on
projected settlements for claims and include estimates for claims incurred but
not reported.   Any adjustments made to previously recorded reserves are
reflected in current operating results.  Amounts charged to expense for self
insured liabilities were $4,209,000, $4,529,000 and $3,029,000 in 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

         REVENUE RECOGNITION -- Revenues from product sales are recognized upon
shipment of the product from warehouse distribution to independently-owned
retail stores and at the point of sale for Company-owned retail stores.

         STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS -- Store pre-opening costs, primarily employee
training, inventory stocking and advertising, are charged to expense concurrent
with store openings.

         RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
year financial statements to conform with current year presentation.  These
reclassifications did not affect results of operations previously reported.

         NET INCOME PER SHARE -- Net income per share is computed by dividing
net income less preferred stock dividends by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding.  Outstanding stock options do not have a significant
dilutive effect on net income per share.

(2)      Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable:
         ------------------------------------
         The Company's trade accounts and notes receivable are primarily with
various wholesale customers which are engaged in  retail food distribution in
northeast and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania.

         The Company's notes receivable principally arise from the  financing
of store leaseholds, inventory and fixed assets related to the operations of
the Company's independently-owned wholesale customers.  Loans to independent
retailers, as well as trade accounts receivable, are primarily collateralized
by the retailers' inventory, equipment and fixtures.  The notes range in length
from 1 to 7 years and primarily bear interest at prime plus 1.0% or 1.5%.  The
estimated fair market value of the notes approximates their net carrying value
at July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993.

         Trade accounts receivable include $4,664,000 and $3,736,000 of the
current portion of notes receivable at July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993,
respectively.  Trade accounts receivable were net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts of $3,295,000 at July 2, 1994 and $3,985,000 at July 3, 1993,
respectively.

(4)     Income Taxes:
        -------------
        At the beginning of 1994, the Company adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes".  This statement requires that
the liability method of accounting for income taxes be used rather than the
deferred method previously used.  The Company elected not to restate prior
years' financial statements and the cumulative effect of this accounting change
was to increase 1994 net income by $6,866,000 or $.85 per share.  The
cumulative effect is principally the result of benefiting the expected
utilization of tax net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) and the adjustment of
deferred tax balances to reflect changes in statutory rates.

</TABLE>

SFAS No. 109 requires that the tax benefit of such NOL be recognized as an
asset to the extent the Company assesses the utilization of such NOL to be
"more likely than not".  Based upon the Company's history of prior earnings,
expectations for future earnings and tax regulations which limit the annual
amount of NOL available for deduction, the Company does not currently believe
it is more likely than not that the entire amount of NOL will be utilized
before they expire.  As such, a valuation reserve of $4,648,000 has been
established due to the uncertainty of future NOL realization.

         Prior to the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 109, realization of these
NOL was recognized as a reduction of purchase accounting for non-current
assets until such time as the carrying values were written off.  The Company
utilized $2,166,000 and $4,532,000 of NOL in 1993 and 1992.  On an after tax
basis, $253,000 of the 1993 utilization was recognized as an extraordinary item
after $483,000 was utilized to write-off the remaining balance of non-current
purchase price assets.  All of the 1992 utilization reduced non-current
purchase price assets.

</TABLE>

         The Company's bank credit facilities (Facilities) provide for
revolving lines of credit, letters of credit and a term loan up to an aggregate
of $75 million.  Borrowings under the revolving lines of credit are due in June
1996 but may be extended to June 1998 upon consent of the banks.  The term loan
is payable in quarterly installments of $428,571 over five years with a balloon
payment due in April 1998.  Borrowings under the lines of credit and term loan
accrue interest at .5% over the Bank's Prime Interest Rate and are paid
monthly.  Commitment fees representing .25% per annum of the unused facilities
plus agency fees of $2,500 per month are also paid monthly.  Available unused
borrowing capacity under these Facilities at July 2, 1994 was approximately
$10.1 million.

         The Facilities consist of separate credit agreements for each of the
Company's significant operating entities (collectively the Consolidated Credit
Agreement).  Borrowings under each individual facility cannot exceed 85% of the
respective entities qualified receivables, plus from 55% to 65% of eligible
inventory and 100% of





                                       37
<PAGE>   39
eligible cash and cash equivalents, less certain reserves and obligations, all
as defined in the Consolidated Credit Agreement.  The Facilities are secured by
substantially all the assets of Riser and each individual credit facility is
cross-guaranteed by all other subsidiaries and guaranteed by Riser.

         Among other covenants, the Consolidated Credit Agreement requires that
the Company maintain, on a consolidated basis,  minimum levels of tangible net
worth and cash flows and minimum ratios of liabilities to tangible net worth
and capital expenditures to cash flows, which vary each fiscal year.  The
agreement further provides for limitations on dividends and capital
expenditures.  The Company is in compliance with or has obtained Bank waiver
for all covenants at July 2, 1994.

         The Company's Taxable Variable Rate Demand Notes (Notes) bear interest
at a variable rate based on the higher of the average 30-day or 90-day
commercial paper rate, plus a market increment which at July 2, 1994 was .125%,
payable monthly.  Principal under the Notes is payable in annual installments
of $2,000,000 through December 1, 1997 and $3,000,000 on December 1, 1998.  The
Notes are secured by a bank letter of credit.  The bank letter of credit
expires in June 1996, has an annual fee of 1% on the outstanding note balance,
and is secured by the Facilities.

         Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an
exchange transaction which fixed the higher of the 30-day or 90- day commercial
paper rate at 6.50% through December 1, 1994 at dollar amounts which correspond
to the Notes outstanding.  The Company records interest expense on the Notes as
if the interest rate was fixed at 6.5% and charges expense currently.

         The 9.75% Subordinated Debentures are recorded net of an original
issue discount, based on an imputed interest rate of 12%, which is being
amortized over the term of the indebtedness using the effective interest
method.  These debentures, originally issued by a subsidiary of the Company,
require semiannual interest payments and may be redeemed at the Company's
option at 100% of the principal amount.

         The Company redeemed the entire outstanding principal balance of the
6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures at their maturity date, June 1, 1994.
One bondholder exercised the option to convert the debenture into 37 shares of
the Company's Rini-Rego Supermarkets, Inc. (f/k/a Fisher Foods, Inc.)
subsidiary.

         Certain property and equipment, with an aggregate net value for
financial reporting purposes of $25,284,000, was pledged to secure real estate
first mortgages on July 2, 1994.

     No quoted market prices are available for any of the Company's long-term
debt as it is not actively traded.  Management, however believes the carrying
values of the Company's borrowings under its bank credit facility, the notes
and real estate mortgages approximate their fair values as all bear interest at
current market rates.  It was not practical to estimate the fair value of the
Company's 9.75% subordinated debentures because of the inability to estimate
fair value without incurring excessive costs.

(6)      Leases:
         ------
         The Company leases many of its retail store locations, warehouse
facilities and certain operating equipment under capital and operating leases.
Most of the retail store leases contain contingent rent clauses based on sales
levels.  In most instances, the Company has the option to extend the term of
the lease.  Some of the retail store locations and the warehouse facilities are
leased from parties that are related through common ownership and control.

equipment and capital leases, consisted of the following amounts (in

        The 1994 restructuring charge represents estimated costs associated
with the Company's retail store consolidation plan in which the Company plans
to close 14 small, outdated Company-owned retail stores representing
approximately 456,000 square feet.  These stores will be replaced by seven
newer, larger stores representing approximately 431,000 square feet.  Two of
these newer stores will be operated by wholesale customers and the remaining
five stores will be new or expanded Company-owned retail stores.  At July 2,
1994, the Company had closed five of the stores included in the 1994
restructuring charge with the remaining nine stores to be closed over the next
four years.

              The 1993 restructuring charge represented the estimated costs
   associated with the closing of seven retail stores including six Carl's or
   former Carl's stores.  The 1992 restructuring charge represented the
   estimated costs associated with the closing of a former Carl's location.
   These closings were the result of the Company's decision to focus efforts on
   its core store format, Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop.

              At July  2, 1994 the net book value of fixed assets and property
   pertaining to closed facilities was $7,741,000.  An allowance to reduce
   these assets to their estimated net realizable value is included in the
   allowance for depreciation, amortization and loss on disposal, while the
   long-term portion of the reserve for closing facilities is classified in
   other liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets.

   (8)   Employee Benefit Plans:
         -----------------------
              The Company sponsors an employee savings plan (401(k)) for all
   non-union employees.  Contributions to the plan are in the form of employee
   salary deferrals and Company matching funds.  Amounts contributed and
   expensed for Company matching funds was $229,000 in 1994 and $65,000 in
   1993.  There were no Company matching funds in 1992.

              The Company also participates in various multi-employer pension
   plans.  The plans provide for defined benefits to substantially all of the
   Company's union employees.  Amounts charged to pension cost and contributed
   to the plans were approximately $4,789,000, $4,860,000, and $4,932,000 for
   1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  At the dates of the latest actuarial
   valuations, the aggregate withdrawal liability for the multi-employer
   pension plans totaled approximately $1,495,000.

              In December 1990, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
   106 "Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits other than Pensions" was
   issued.  This standard requires that the expected cost of these benefits
   must be charged to expense during the years the employees render service.
   The Company does not have any significant post retirement benefits other
   than those disclosed in Note 11 which have been fully accrued.

   (9)   Capital Stock:
         --------------
         Each share of Series A Preferred stock is convertible, at the option
    of the holder, into 9.79 shares of Class A Common Stock and is redeemable,
    at the option of the Company, at $105 per share.

         The holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per
    share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per

     separate class and be entitled to elect 25% of the total number of
     directors and the Class B Common Stockholders will elect the remaining
     directors.  Amounts shown on the balance sheet are net of 1,553,630 shares
     of Class A Common stock outstanding that are held by a Riser subsidiary.

          The Company has a Stock Incentive Plan which provides for both
     qualified and non-qualified stock options, as well as stock appreciation
     rights and restricted stock grants for employees, officers and directors
     of Riser.  Under the terms of the plan, up to 500,000 Class A Common
     Shares may be the subject of options, stock appreciation rights or
     restricted stock grants.  Stock options must be issued at not less than
     fair value of the Class A Common Stock at the date of grant and are
     exercisable for up to ten years from the date of grant.  Options
     outstanding under this plan are as follows:

     shares of a Riser subsidiary's common stock, issued pursuant to that 
     subsidiary's Stock Option Plan, were converted into options to acquire 
     Class A Common Stock.  These outstanding options, totaling 7,000 at 
     July 2, 1994, are at option prices ranging from $9.25 to $15.13.

(10)     Investment in Stop-N-Shop Supermarkets:
         ---------------------------------------
         The Company has a 69% ownership and 38% voting interest in the
Association of Stop-N-Shop Supermarkets (Association), an association of
Cleveland grocery retailers that provides combined advertising and other
services to members.  The Company accounts for this investment using the equity
method of accounting.

         Amounts paid to the Association for services provided to the Company
totaled approximately $7,265,000, $6,604,000, and $4,161,400 for 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  The trade accounts payable balance in the accompanying
balance sheet includes amounts due the Association of approximately $895,000 at
July 2, 1994 and $994,000 at July 3, 1993.  The trade accounts receivable
balance in the accompanying balance sheet includes amounts due from the
Association of approximately $744,000 at July 2, 1994 and $216,000 at July 3,
1993.

(11)     Employees' Retirement Benefit:
         ------------------------------
         The Company maintains retirement benefit arrangements for certain
former key executives of the Company.  The plans primarily provide for payments
to these executives for life with a three-year extension for surviving spouses.
The Company recorded expense of $472,000 in 1993 and no expense in 1994 and
1992 related to these agreements.  The amount accrued for these plans was
$2,711,000 at July 2, 1994 and $2,898,000 at July 3, 1993.

(12)     Contingent Liabilities:
         ----------------------
         The Company, through one of its subsidiaries, is the guarantor of
certain lease obligations and mortgages of Dominick's Finer Foods, Inc., a
former subsidiary. The lease obligations covered total approximately
$17,106,000 over the noncancelable term of the obligations, some of which
extend to the year 2006.  The Company has no collateral or security interests
in the lease obligations or mortgages.  Management believes that the contingent
liability, if any, resulting from the guarantee of the obligations will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

         The agreement expires in December, 1998 and may be terminated by
either party upon six months notice and upon the payment of certain fees for
termination.

         The Company is also involved in a number of other legal proceedings
incidental to its business.  Management believes that the liability, if any,
resulting from all pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the results of its
operations.

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor, the Banks and the
Agent do hereby agree as follows:

                           SECTION 1.  DEFINED TERMS.
                           --------------------------
   Each defined term used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have

subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as follows:

          AMENDMENT TO SECTION 14.  Section 14 shall be amended to delete the

   "CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME" means, for any period, the aggregate net income of
   the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries for such period (after taxes and after
   extraordinary items, but without giving effect to any gain from any
   re-appraisal or write-up of any asset after December 31, 1992), as
   determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted
   accounting principles; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, solely with respect to the
   Fiscal Quarter of the Guarantor ending October 23, 1993, the "Consolidated
   Net Income" of the Guarantor shall be calculated giving effect to the
   Guarantor's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109.

   "METLIFE AGREEMENT" means each loan and security agreement, each in form and
   substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the Majority Banks,
   entered into between Rini-Rego and MetLife Capital Corporation evidencing
   indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed Six Million
   Dollars ($6,000,000), pursuant to which Rini-Rego will finance the purchase
   of Capital Expenditures.
