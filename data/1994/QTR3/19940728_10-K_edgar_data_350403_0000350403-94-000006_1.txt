                                               PART I

          Item 1.  Business.

          General

                The Company was incorporated as a Delaware  corporation  in
          1949  and  since  that  time  its  primary  business  has been to
          transport  personnel, and to a lesser extent parts and equipment,
          to, from, and  among  offshore platforms for customers engaged in
          the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry.
          During the most recent  fiscal  year  approximately  73%  of  the
          Company's  operating  revenues  was  generated  by  oil  and  gas
          transportation  services  in federal and state waters offshore of
          the States of Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and
          California (the "domestic Gulf").   Approximately  77% and 82% of
          operating  revenues  were  derived  from  these services  in  the
          domestic Gulf in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively.

                The  Company's  aeromedical  transportation   services  for
          hospitals  and  medical  programs  accounted for 13% of operating
          revenues  in  fiscal 1994.  Aeromedical  transportation  services
          generated 10% and  8%  of  operating  revenues in fiscal 1993 and
          1992, respectively.

                The remaining 14% of 1994 operating  revenues was generated
          primarily from aircraft maintenance services  provided to outside
          parties   and   the   Company's   international  business.    The
          international   business  consists  of   onshore   and   offshore
          helicopter transportation  services  and  fixed-wing services for
          the international oil and gas industry.

                Demand  for the Company's helicopter services  is  strongly
          influenced by offshore  oil  and gas exploration, development and
          production activities in the areas in which it operates, which in
          turn is influenced primarily by  oil and gas prices.  In general,
          helicopters perform a useful service  when  their  expense can be
          justified  by  the  labor  and other cost savings resulting  from
          their faster transportation  times.   Each  of  the Company's ten
          principal types of helicopters is available on an  hourly,  daily
          or monthly basis.

                The Company maintains master operating agreements with each
          of its major customers, which set forth general rights and duties
          of the Company and the customer.  Although the Company is a party
          to  a  limited  number  of  contracts  with  a  term of one year,
          services to the domestic Gulf are generally provided  pursuant to
          monthly extensions of these operating agreements, and prices  are
          fixed for each contract extension.  Contracts for aeromedical and
          foreign business are generally entered into for longer terms.

                Charges  under  operating agreements are generally based on
          fixed  monthly fees and  additional  hourly  charges  for  actual
          flight time.   Because  the  Company  is  compensated  in part by
          flight hour, prolonged adverse weather conditions that result  in
          reduced  flight hours can adversely affect results of operations.
          See "- Weather and Seasonal Aspects."

                The  Company  has  historically  realized substantial gains
          from the sales of its helicopters.

          <PAGE>
          
          Weather and Seasonal Aspects

                Poor  visibility,  high winds and heavy  precipitation  can
          affect the safe use of helicopters and result in a reduced number
          of flight hours.  Since a  significant  portion  of the Company's
          revenues  is  dependent on actual flight hours and a  substantial
          portion of the  Company's  costs  is  fixed, prolonged periods of
          adverse weather can materially and adversely affect the Company's
          operating revenues and net earnings.

                In  the  domestic  Gulf,  the months  of  December  through
          February have more days of adverse  weather  conditions and fewer
          hours   of   daylight   than  the  other  months  of  the   year.
          Consequently, flight hours  are  generally  lower  than  at other
          times  of  the  year, which typically results in a  reduction  in
          revenues from operations during those months.

                The Company  currently operates 44 aircraft equipped to fly
          pursuant to instrument  flight  rules (IFR) in the domestic Gulf,
          which enables these aircraft, when manned by IFR rated pilots and
          co-pilots, to make flights at times when poor visibility prevents
          flights by aircraft that can fly  only  by  visual  flight  rules
          (VFR).  Poor visibility is the most common of the adverse weather
          conditions that affect the Company's operations.

          Hazards and Insurance

                The  operation  of helicopters inherently involves a degree
          of risk.  Hazards, such  as  aircraft accidents, collisions, fire
          and adverse weather, are inherent  in  the  business of providing
          helicopter  services  to  the offshore oil and gas  industry  and
          others and may result in losses  of  equipment and revenues.  The
          Company's safety record is favorable in  comparison to the record
          for  all  United  States  operators  as  reflected   in  industry
          publications.

                The Company maintains hull and liability insurance  on  its
          helicopters, which generally insures the Company against physical
          loss  of, or damage to, its helicopters and against certain legal
          liabilities  to  others.   In  addition,  the Company carries war
          risk,  expropriation, confiscation and nationalization  insurance
          for helicopters  involved  in  international operations.  In some
          limited instances the Company is  covered by indemnity agreements
          from  large  oil  companies in lieu of  or  in  addition  to  its
          insurance.  The Company's helicopters are not insured for loss of
          use.  While the Company  believes  it  is  adequately  covered by
          insurance    and    indemnification   arrangements,   the   loss,
          expropriation or confiscation of, or severe damage to, a material
          number of its helicopters  could  adversely  affect  revenues and
          profits.

          Government Regulation

                As  a  commercial  operator  of  helicopters, the Company's
          flight and maintenance operations are subject  to  regulation  by
          the  Federal  Aviation Administration (the "FAA") pursuant to the
          Federal Aviation  Act  of 1958 (the "Federal Aviation Act").  The
          FAA  has  authority  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  personnel,
          aircraft, ground facilities  and  other  aspects of the Company's
          business.

          <PAGE>
                
                The  Company  transports  personnel  and  property  in  its
          helicopters pursuant to an FAR 135 Air Taxi  certificate  granted
          by  the  FAA.  This certificate contains operating specifications
          that allow  the Company to conduct its present operations but are
          subject to amendment,  suspension  and  revocation  in accordance
          with  procedures  set  forth  in  the Federal Aviation Act.   The
          Company is not required to file tariffs  showing rates, fares and
          other charges with the FAA.  The FAA's regulations,  as currently
          in  effect, also require that not less than 75% of the  Company's
          voting  securities  be  owned  or  controlled  by citizens of the
          United States or one of its possessions, and that  the  president
          and  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  directors of the Company are
          United States citizens.  The Company's  chief  executive  officer
          and  all  of  its  directors  are  United States citizens and its
          organizational documents provide for  the  automatic reduction in
          voting  power  of  each  share of voting common  stock  owned  or
          controlled by a non-United  States citizen if necessary to comply
          with these regulations.

                The National Transportation  Safety  Board is authorized to
          investigate aircraft accidents and to recommend  improved  safety
          standards.  The Company is also subject to the Communications Act
          of  1934  because  of  its  ownership  and  operation  of a radio
          communications  flight  following network throughout the domestic
          Gulf.

                Numerous federal statutes  and  rules regulate the offshore
          operations of the Company and the Company's  customers,  pursuant
          to  which  the  federal  government  has  the ability to suspend,
          curtail  or  modify  certain  or  all  offshore  operations.    A
          suspension  or  substantial  curtailment  of offshore oil and gas
          operations for any prolonged period would have  an  immediate and
          materially   adverse   effect  on  the  Company.   A  substantial
          modification  of  current  offshore  operations  could  adversely
          affect the economics  of  such  operations  and  also  result  in
          reduced demand for helicopter services.

          Competition

                The  Company's business is highly competitive.  Many of the
          Company's contracts  are  awarded  after competitive bidding, and
          the  principal  methods of competition  are  price,  reliability,
          availability, and safety.

                The  Company  believes  it  operates  one  of  the  largest
          commercial helicopter  fleets  in  the world.  At April 30, 1994,
          the Company had 266 aircraft in operation.   The Company operated
          240 helicopters in the United States, of which  181 were operated
          in   the  domestic  Gulf,  26  were  operated  in  the  Company's
          aeromedical  program,  16  were in the hangar for maintenance, 13
          were parked for sale and 4 were  used  for training.  The Company
          is the largest operator of helicopters in  the  domestic Gulf and
          believes there are approximately 6 competitors operating  in  the
          Gulf market.

                Certain  of the Company's customers and potential customers
          in the oil industry operate their own helicopter fleets; however,
          oil companies traditionally  contract for most specialty services
          associated   with  offshore  operations,   including   helicopter
          services.

          <PAGE>
          Employees

                As of April 30, 1994, the Company employed a total of 1,697
          people including  552  pilots,  727  mechanics  and 418 in flight
          operations and administration.

                The   Company  believes  its  employee  relations   to   be
          excellent, and it has never experienced a work stoppage.  None of
          the Company's  employees  is  covered  by union contracts.  Union
          organization   campaigns   in   1970,  1974  and   1980   failed.
          Unionization of some or all of the Company's employees could have
          a material adverse effect on its business.

          Customers

                The Company's principal customers  are major oil companies.
          The  Company  also  serves  smaller  exploration  and  production
          concerns, oil and gas service companies,  hospitals  and  medical
          programs.   The  Company's  largest  customer, Shell Oil Company,
          accounted  for  approximately  10%  of  the  Company's  operating
          revenues  in fiscal 1994.  The Company's five  largest  customers
          were oil and  gas  related  and  accounted  for  34% of operating
          revenues  in  fiscal 1994, and each of 38 customers  including  8
          aeromedical customers,  accounted  for  more  than  $1 million in
          operating revenues during fiscal 1994.

                Division  managers  of  customer  oil  companies,  who  are
          responsible  for  a  majority  of contract services in connection
          with offshore oil activities, generally  contract  for helicopter
          services.  Many oil companies also employ directors  of  aviation
          to  evaluate the capabilities and safety performance of companies
          providing   helicopter   services  and  make  recommendations  to
          division  managers.   Company  management,  along  with  customer
          relations specialists,  are  in  frequent  contact  with division
          managers  and  directors  of  aviation  in  connection with  both
          existing service contracts and potential new business.

          Environmental and Safety Matters

                General.   The  Company  is subject to federal,  state  and
          local environmental laws and regulations  that impose limitations
          on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish
          standards for the treatment, storage and disposal  of  toxic  and
          hazardous wastes.

                The  Company  is  also  subject to the federal Occupational
          Safety and Health Act ("OSHA")  and  similar state statutes.  The
          Company has an extensive health and safety  program and employs a
          safety  staff, including a certified safety professional  in  the
          field  of  comprehensive  practice,  who  is  also  a  registered
          environmental  professional.  The primary functions of the safety
          staff are to develop  Company  policies  that  meet or exceed the
          safety  standards set by OSHA, train Company personnel  and  make
          daily inspections of safety procedures to insure their compliance
          with Company  policies  on safety.  All personnel are required to

          compliance  with  safety procedures is emphasized.   The  Company

          its operations do not expose  its  employees  to  unusual  health
          hazards.

            <FN1> Information regarding the Company's depreciation policy is
                  set forth under Item   8.   "Financial  Statements  and 
                  Supplementary  Data  -  Notes  to Consolidated Financial
                  Statements, Note 1(c)."

                                          ____________________
           
           The Company operates eleven helicopters that are owned
     or  leased  by  customers  which  are  not  reflected in the
     information  set  forth above.  The Company also  owns  four
     fixed-wing  aircraft   two  of  which  are  currently  under
     contract to customers.

           As of April 30, 1994,  the  Company's  commitment  for
     principal  payments  and  lease  payments  for  its  present
     helicopter fleet averaged $16 million each year for the next
     five years and an aggregate of $28 million thereafter.

           Under  most leases the Company is responsible for  all
     insurance, taxes  and  maintenance  expenses associated with
     the helicopters, and within certain limitations, the Company
     can either substitute equipment or terminate  the  leases in
     the  event  the  leased equipment becomes obsolete or is  no
     longer suited for the Company's needs.  All of the foregoing
     leases are considered  operating  leases  for accounting and
     tax purposes.

           The Company also maintains an inventory of fuel and an
     inventory of spare parts and components for  use  in  repair
     and maintenance of the Company's fleet.  This inventory  had
     a book value of approximately $25 million on April 30, 1994.
     The  Company  is  a  distributor or dealer for many of these
     parts  and  components,   thereby  allowing  it  to  realize
     significant cost savings  for  its purchases.  However,  the  
     Company has no long-term contractual rights to continue such 
     relationships.

     <PAGE>

     Equipment on Order

           The Company has agreed to purchase two  helicopters in
     1995 for $5 million.  The Company also plans to  lease  five
     helicopters  with  a  lease  value of $9 million.  The lease
     term is 60 months with monthly  payments  of $67,000 or $0.8
     million per year.  At the end of the lease term, the Company
     may purchase the aircraft for 88% of the original  lease, or
     $7.9 million, or return the aircraft and pay the lessor  13%
     of  the original lease amount, or $1.2 million.  The Company
     also   has  non-binding agreements to purchase 15 additional
     aircraft none of which are expected to be purchased in 1995.

     Equipment Sales

           The Company  sells  aircraft  whenever they (i) become
     obsolete, (ii) do not fit into future fleet plans, (iii) are
     subject  to  unusually  strong and specific  demand  in  the
     resale market, or (iv) are surplus to the Company's needs.

           The Company typically  sells  its helicopters for more
     than their book value.  The Company cannot predict, however,
     whether these results will continue or  whether  such prices
     would be realized if the Company were to sell large  numbers
     of helicopters in a short period of time.

     Facilities

           The  Company  leases 4,362 square feet of office space
     in a building owned by  Offshore Navigation, Inc., (owner of
     12.6% of the Company's voting  common  stock),  in Jefferson
     Parish   (Metropolitan   New   Orleans),  Louisiana,  on   a
     month-to-month basis, for the Company's  executive  offices.
     The  Company  believes  that  it will be able to occupy this
     space for as long as necessary  because  of its relationship
     with Offshore Navigation, Inc.

           The  Company's  principal  operational   facility   is
     located  on  property  leased  from  The  Lafayette  Airport
     Commission  at  the  Lafayette Regional Airport in Lafayette
     Parish,  Louisiana.  The  leases  cover  approximately  28.2
     acres and  17  buildings, with an aggregate of approximately
     135,000 square feet,  housing the Company's main operational
     and administrative office  and  main  repair and maintenance
     facility.   The  Company  has options to extend  this  lease
     until 2006.

           In  addition,  the  Company  leases  property  for  18
     additional  bases  to  service  the  oil  and  gas  industry
     throughout the domestic  Gulf  and  two bases in California.
     Those bases that represent a significant  investment  by the
     Company  in leasehold improvements or which are particularly
     important to the Company's operations are:

           A.    Morgan   City   Base  (Louisiana)  -  containing
     approximately 53 acres, is under  a  lease  that  expired on
     June  30, 1994 and was extended by the Company through  June
     30, 1998.   The  Company  has built a variety of operational
     and maintenance facilities on this property, including
     
     <PAGE>
     
     landing pads for 46 helicopters.   The Company believes that
     this  facility  is the largest commercial  heliport  in  the
     world.

           B.    Intracoastal  City Base (Louisiana) - containing
     approximately 22.5 acres under  several leases in Vermillion
     Parish,  all  with  options to extend  through  2001.    The
     Company has built a variety  of  operational and maintenance
     facilities on this property, including  landing  pads for 45
     helicopters.

           C.    Houma-Terrebonne     Airport    (Louisiana)    -
     containing approximately 13.6  acres  and  certain buildings
     leased  under four leases from the Houma-Terrebonne  Airport
     Commission,  which  have  options  allowing extension of the
     lease through 1999.  The Company has  landing  pads  for  30
     helicopters on this property.

           D.    Sabine  Pass  (Texas) - containing approximately
     22 acres under two leases, one of which, for 1.6 acres, will
     expire February 28, 1995, and the other of which will expire
     September  30,  1997  with  an   option  to  extend  through
     September  30, 2002.  The Company has  built  a  variety  of
     operational  and  maintenance  facilities  on this property,
     including landing pads for 24 helicopters.

           E.    New    Orleans    (Louisiana)    -    containing
     approximately 1.5 acres, is under a lease through April  30,
     2004.    The   location   contains   significant   leasehold
     improvements including landing pads for 14 helicopters.

           F.    Venice (Louisiana) - containing approximately  8
     acres,  is  under  a  lease  expiring  March  31, 1995.  The
     original lease was executed April 1, 1973 for one  year  and
     has  been  extended  annually since that time.  The location
     contains landing pads for 27 helicopters.

           G.    Fourchon (Louisiana)  - containing approximately
     8 acres, is under original lease expiring  April  30,  1996.
     The property has 10 landing pads.

           The  Company's  other  operations related bases in the
     United  States  are  located  along  the  domestic  Gulf  in
     Louisiana  at  Cameron,  Grand  Isle,   Lake   Charles   and
     Schriever;  in  Texas at Bay City, Brazoria, Corpus Christi,
     Galveston, Port O'Connor  and  Rockport;  in  Mississippi at
     Pascagoula; and in California at Huntington Beach  and Santa
     Barbara.

           The Company operates from offshore platforms which are
     provided  free  of  charge  by  the owners of the platforms,
     although in certain instances the  Company  is  required  to
     indemnify  the  owners  against  loss in connection with the
     Company's use.

           Bases  of  operations for the  Company's  foreign  and
     aeromedical  operations   are  generally  furnished  by  the
     customer.  The Company's foreign  operations  are  currently
     conducted  in  Angola,  Argentina,  Canada, Colombia, Kenya,
     Philippines,  Portugal,  Trinidad,  Venezuela   and   Zaire.
     Aeromedical  operations  are currently conducted in Arizona,
     Arkansas,   California,   Florida,    Illinois,    Kentucky,
     Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.

     Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

           The  Company is named as a defendant in various  legal
     actions arising  out  of incidents related to its helicopter
     operations.  The amount,  if any, of ultimate liability with
     respect to such matters cannot be determined; however, after
     consulting with legal counsel, the Company believes any such
     liability will not have a material  effect  on the Company's
     financial condition.

     Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

           No  matters  were  submitted  to  a  vote of  security
     holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal  year  ended
     April 30, 1994.

           The declaration  and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the
     Board  of  Directors,  which   evaluates   the  Company's  dividend  policy
     quarterly.  Future dividends are dependent upon,  among  other  things, the
     Company's  results  of  operations, financial condition, cash requirements,
     future prospects and other  factors deemed relevant by the Board.  A credit
     agreement  to  which  the  Company  is  a  party  generally  restricts  the
     declaration or payment of dividends to 20% of net earnings for the previous
     four fiscal quarters.  See Item 8.  "Financial Statements and Supplementary
     Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2."

           As of July 19, 1994 there  were approximately 1,576 holders of record
     of the Company's voting common stock  and  133  holders  of  record  of the
     Company's non-voting common stock.

            Demand  for  the  Company's  offshore  oil  and  gas  transportation
      services began to decline during fiscal  1991  due  to reduced exploration
      and production activity in the U.S. Gulf.  This trend  continued in fiscal
      1992  and  into the first quarter of fiscal 1993 before reversing  in  the
      second quarter  of  fiscal  1993 due in part to rising natural gas prices.
      The offshore drilling rig count is summarized in the following table:

                                    May           May         June          June
                                   1994          1993         1992          1991
      Active Rigs in U.S. Gulf      125           102          60            119

      <PAGE>

            While the rig count has  recovered  since  June  1992, the Company's
      management believes the rig count could trend downward as  a reflection of
      the oil and gas industry's concerns over unstable domestic oil,  and  to a
      lesser   extent,  gas  prices  combined  with  strict  U.S.  environmental
      legislation.   These  concerns  have caused exploration companies to shift
      much of their activities from the  U.S. market to the international market
      where less strict environmental policies  make  drilling for minerals more
      economically viable.  Although the active rig count  in the Gulf increased
      during  this  past  fiscal  year,  the  Company's  domestic Gulf  revenues
      declined  by  5%  from  $132.7  million to $126.1 million.   This  decline
      evidences  that competitive pricing  pressures  have  increased  and  that
      customers are  increasingly  sharing  aircraft  or employing aircraft on a
      shorter term hourly basis.  The $20 million decline  in operating revenues
      between fiscal 1992 and 1993 was consistent with the slower  domestic  oil
      and gas market.

            Management has continued to respond to these conditions by expanding
      marketing  efforts  in  the domestic aeromedical and the international oil
      and gas markets.  This marketing  emphasis  increased  the  Company's name
      recognition  as  a  leader  in  both  markets and currently provides  more
      opportunities to bid for new business.   Presently  there  is  uncertainty
      related  to  Federal  regulation  of  the  health  care  industry  and the
      stability  of  the international oil and gas industry; however, management
      will continue to  search  for  new  opportunities that warrant the risk in
      these markets.  The result of the Company's  efforts  is  reflected in the
      increase of total revenues from aeromedical and international  flights  of
      23% to $35.6 million and 15% to $29 million in fiscal years 1994 and 1993,
      respectively.   The  Company  also  made  significant  reductions  in  its
      workforce  and  helicopter  fleet which had a positive impact on expenses.
      The following tables provide selected information regarding the results of
      management's efforts:

            Direct expenses declined  $1.1  million  in  fiscal 1994 due to a $1
      million  decrease  in  helicopter  rent,  a  $0.5  million   reduction  in
      depreciation  and  a  $0.5  million decline in taxes.  Salaries were  $0.8
      million higher due to a 4% cost  of living increase in July 1993 which was
      offset  by  staffing reductions later  in  the  fiscal  year.   Helicopter
      insurance expense  increased  by $0.7 million due to an increase in rates.
      Direct expenses in fiscal 1993  were reduced $20.3  million as payroll and
      related  costs  declined  approximately   $12   million   and   helicopter
      depreciation  and  rental,  fuel,  parts  usage  and  outside  maintenance
      declined  in  response  to  reduced  flight  hours  and  helicopter  fleet
      reductions.

            The  Company's selling, general and administrative expense decreased
      $2.9 million in fiscal 1994 primarily as a result of $2.1 million spent in
      fiscal 1993  related  to senior management transition.  Reductions of $0.3
      million  in bad debt expense  and  $0.6  million  in  salaries  were  also
      realized.   The increase in fiscal 1993, when compared to fiscal 1992, was
      also related  to  the  senior  management transition charges and increased
      compensation and sales promotion  expenses  associated  with the Company's
      expanded sales and marketing programs.

            Equipment disposal results in fiscal 1993 were greater than 1994 and
      1992  as  the  Company  disposed  of more aircraft in 1993 than  1994  and
      casualty losses charged to this account  declined  in  1993 as compared to
      1992.  The Company disposed of six, nine and ten aircraft  in fiscal years
      1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

            The Company's borrowing costs increased $0.4 million in  fiscal 1994
      due to higher average borrowing levels incurred for the purchase  of three
      additional   aircraft  for  the  Company's  aeromedical  program.   Higher
      interest rates  were also a factor in 1994.  The Company's borrowing costs
      in 1993 were $1.5  million  lower than 1992 due to lower average borrowing
      levels and declining interest rates.

            PHI's effective tax rate was 40%, 39%, and 54% in the 1994, 1993 and
      1992 fiscal years, respectively.   The  rate  in  fiscal  1992  was higher
      because  of  certain  non-deductible  expenses  and increased state income
      taxes.

      Liquidity and Capital Resources

            Cash  generated  from  operating activities in  1994  and  1993  was
      essentially constant at $16.3  million  and $16.1 million, respectively as
      compared to $19.8 million in 1992.  Cash flow generated by working capital
      was $3.8 million, $5.9 million and $7.8 million for the fiscal years ended
      1994,  1993  and 1992, respectively.  These  trends  are  consistent  with
      operating levels  for the periods presented.  The Company's use of cash in
      1994 included a net  investment  in  equipment,  primarily helicopters, of
      $12.7 million and a reduction in long-term debt of $0.2 million.

            In response to reduced operating cash flow,  dividends  were limited
      to  $55,000  in  1993  and discontinued after the first quarter of  fiscal
      1993.  See Item 5.  "Market  Price  for  Registrant's  Common  Equity  and
      Related Stockholder Matters."

      <PAGE>

            In  July 1993, the Company amended its agreements with its principal
      lenders to, among other things, increase borrowing capacity for helicopter
      purchases during  the  next  two  years.   In  addition,  approximately $9
      million of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit  facility  were
      refinanced  on  a  long-term  basis.   In  April 1994, the Company further
      amended its agreements to permit London Inter-bank Borrowings ("LIBOR") at
      LIBOR rates plus a floating spread.  The spread  (currently  2.625%)  will
      float up or down based on the Company's performance.  The Company believes
      this  change  will result in a lower effective rate.  As of June 22, 1994,
      the Company had  $11  million and $15 million of available credit capacity
      under the term and revolving credit facilities, respectively.  The Company
      believes it is in full compliance with its financing agreements.  See Item
      8.  "Financial Statements  and  Supplemental  Data - Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements, Note 2."

            The  Company  currently  has  outstanding  capital   commitments  of
      approximately $5 million, primarily for helicopter purchases.  See Item 2.
      - "Properties - Equipment on Order."

            In   July   1994,   the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  (the
      "Agreement") with American  Eurocopter  Corporation (AEC) to acquire up to
      25 emergency medical service (EMS) contracts  and  the related helicopters
      and certain other assets that service these contracts  from Rocky Mountain
      Helicopters  (RMH).  RMH is presently operating under Chapter  11  of  the
      U.S. Bankruptcy  Code.   PHI's  agreement  with  AEC,  one  of the largest
      creditors  of  RMH,  is  conditional  upon, among other things, bankruptcy
      court  confirmation  of  AEC's  plan.  RMH  has  filed  its  own  plan  of
      reorganization and is currently expected  to  oppose  the AEC plan and the
      closing of the Agreement.

            Management  estimates  annual  revenues  associated  with   the  EMS
      contracts  are $27 million.  If  these contracts and assets are ultimately
      acquired, PHI would pay AEC a portion of the contract revenues received as
      reimbursement  of  the  purchase  price  and  assume  certain post closing
      obligations  under  the  EMS  contracts  and  the  helicopter  leases  and
      financing  instruments.   While  the  acquisition of these  contracts  and
      assets may have a material impact on future  operations,  management  does
      not believe that such event would have a materially unfavorable effect  on
      the Company's liquidity or capital resources.

            The  Company  believes  its cash flow from operations in conjunction
      with its credit capacity is sufficient  to  meet  its planned requirements
      for the forthcoming fiscal year.

                             PETROLEUM HELICOPTERS, INC.
                                   AND SUBSIDIARIES

                      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                            April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992


      (1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

            (a) Principles of Consolidation

               The  consolidated  financial statements include the accounts
               of  Petroleum  Helicopters,   Inc.   and   its  wholly-owned
               subsidiaries   after  the  elimination  of  all  significant
               intercompany accounts  and  transactions.  Investments in 20
               percent to 50 percent owned affiliates  are accounted for by
               the  equity method and consist primarily of  investments  in
               foreign affiliates.

            (b) Cash Equivalents

               The Company  considers  cash  equivalents  to include demand
               deposits  and  investments with original maturity  dates  of
               three months or less.

            (c) Property and Equipment

               Property and equipment  are carried at cost less accumulated
               depreciation.  Depreciation  is computed using the straight-
               line method based upon estimated  useful  lives of ten years
               for  flight  equipment  and  four  to  ten years  for  other
               equipment.  A residual value of 25% of cost  is  used in the
               calculation  of  depreciation of flight equipment and  other
               equipment.  When property and equipment is sold or otherwise
               disposed  of,  the cost  and  accumulated  depreciation  are
               removed from the  accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
               reflected  in  earnings   at  the  time  of  sale  or  other
               disposition,  except  in the  case  of  long-term  sale  and
               leaseback transactions.

            (d) Income Taxes

               A consolidated federal  income  tax  return  is filed by the
               Company  and its subsidiaries.  Income taxes have  not  been
               provided on  the  undistributed net earnings of the investee
               companies since, among  other  things,  the  amount of taxes
               involved are not significant.

               Income  taxes  are  accounted  for  in  accordance with  the
               provisions  of  Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards
               No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.   Under  the asset and
               liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets and
      <PAGE>
               liabilities  are  recognized for the future tax consequences
               attributable to differences  between the financial statement
               carrying  amounts  of existing assets  and  liabilities  and
               their  respective  tax   bases.   Deferred  tax  assets  and
               liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
               apply  to  taxable  income  in  the  years  in  which  those
               temporary  differences  are  expected  to  be  recovered  or
               settled.  Under Statement 109,  the  effect  on deferred tax
               assets  and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates   is
               recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  included  the
               enactment date.

            (e)  Self-Insurance

               The Company maintains a self-insurance program for a portion
               of  its health care costs.  The Company is liable for claims
               up  to   $200,000   per  covered  individual  annually,  and
               aggregate claims up to  $5,800,000 annually.  Self-insurance
               costs are accrued based upon  the aggregate of the liability
               for reported claims and the estimated  liability  for claims
               incurred but not reported.

               The   Company   does  not  presently  have  any  significant
               obligations for post employment benefits.

            (f)  Concentration of Credit Risk

               The Company's financial  instruments  that  are  exposed  to
               concentrations  of credit risk consist primarily of cash and
               cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.  The Company
               places its cash and  temporary  cash  investments  with high
               quality   financial   institutions   and  currently  invests
               primarily in U.S. government obligations  with maturities of
               less than three months.

               A majority of the Company's business is conducted with major
               oil  and  gas exploration companies with operations  in  the
               Gulf  of Mexico.   The  Company  continually  evaluates  the
               financial  strength  of  its  customers but does not require
               collateral to support the customer receivables.  The Company
               establishes an allowance for doubtful  accounts  based  upon
               factors  surrounding  the credit risk of specific customers,
               current market conditions and other information.

            (g) Reclassifications

               Certain reclassifications  have been made to the prior years
               financial  statements  in  order   to   conform   with   the
               classifications adopted for reporting in 1994.

                     $15,000,000 with interest

                     installments of

                     July 9, 1993 with a
                     fixed interest rate of
                     7.0%                                     8,729           -

                                                             40,553      39,500

                  Long-term portion                       $  31,849   $  30,950

                  Subsequent to year end, the Company, upon placing the related
                  helicopters in service,  retired  the  promissory  notes  due 
                  December    31,  1994.   The  debt   was   satisfied  through 
                  additional borrowings of  $2 million under the Company's term 
                  loan  facility.  The   $1.3  million  is not reflected in the 
                  current portion of long-term debt.

                  Scheduled maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

                                                         (Thousands of
                                                            dollars)

                           1997                              8,810
                           1998                              7,192
                           1999                                931
                           Thereafter                        4,661

                  At April 30, 1994, the following  assets  and  their related 
                  book values are pledged as collateral on notes aggregating 
                  $39.3 million:

                                                         (Thousands of
                                                            dollars)

                     Equipment, net of depreciation       $ 54,640
                     Inventory                              24,609
                     Accounts receivable, net               25,725

                                                          $104,974

            The loan agreements require the Company to maintain certain levels
            of  working  capital  and  stockholders' equity and contain  other
            provisions some of which restrict expenditures for the purchase of
            the Company's stock, for capital  expenditures  and for payment of
            dividends.  Such agreements also limit the creation, incurrence or
            assumption  of  Funded Debt (as defined, which includes  long-term
            debt), and the acquisition of investments.  At April 30, 1994, the
            Company's  working   capital   exceeded  the  amount  required  by
            approximately $8.7 million, and  stockholders' equity exceeded the
            required  level  by  approximately $3.6  million.   Dividends  are
            generally limited to 20% of net earnings.

            In April 1994, the Company  amended  its agreements concerning the
            term loan note and revolving credit agreement  with  its principal
            lenders   to,   among   other  things,  permit  London  Inter-bank
            Borrowings ("LIBOR") at LIBOR  rates  plus a floating spread.  The
            spread for LIBOR and/or prime rate borrowings  will  float  up  or
            down  based  on  the  Company's  performance  as  determined  by a
            leverage ratio.  There were no LIBOR borrowings at April 30, 1994.

            At  April  30,  1994,  the  Company  was  in  compliance  with the
            provisions of its loan agreements.

      <PAGE>
            
            Interest  paid  was $2,136,000, $2,231,000 and $3,725,000 for  the
            years ended April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

            For income tax purposes, the Company had approximately  $3,383,000
            of  investment  tax  credit  carryforwards.  These investment  tax
            credit  carryforwards will expire  between  1995  and  2001.   The
            Company also has approximately $725,000 of alternative minimum tax
            credit carryforwards  available  to  reduce future Federal regular
            income taxes over an indefinite period.

            The  tax  effects  of temporary differences  which  give  rise  to
            significant portions  of  the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
            liabilities at April 30, 1994 and 1993 are presented below:

            No valuation allowance was  recorded  against the net deferred tax
            assets because management believes that  the  deferred  tax assets
            will be realized in full.

            Income  taxes  paid  were  approximately $470,000, $1,971,000  and
            $5,500,000 for the years ended  April  30,  1994,  1993  and 1992,
            respectively.

      (4)   Employee Savings Plan

            The  Company  established,  effective  July  1,  1989, an Employee
            Savings  Plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue  Code.
            The Plan provides  that  the  Company  match  up to 3% of employee
            contributions.    The   Company's  contribution  was   $1,604,000,
            $1,410,000 and $1,500,000 for the years ended April 30, 1994, 1993
            and 1992, respectively.

      (5)   Stock Option Plans

            Effective May 1, 1992, the  Company's  Board  of Directors adopted
            the  Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. 1992 Non-Qualified  Stock  Option
            and Stock  Appreciation  Rights  Plan  (the "Plan").  The Plan was
            approved at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders  on  September  30,
            1992.   The  Company  is  authorized  to grant non-qualified stock
            options and stock appreciation rights (Sar)  to selected employees
            to  purchase  up  to  100,000  shares of the Company's  non-voting
            common stock at an exercise price  of  not  less than 25% of their
            Fair  Market  Value  at  the date of grant.  The  options  may  be
            exercised any time after one  year  from  the  date of grant until
            their expiration at five years from such date.

            During  fiscal  1993  an officer of the Company was  granted  non-
            qualified options to purchase 15,000 shares of voting common stock
            at the fair market value  of  the stock at the date of grant.  The
            options were not granted under  the 1992 Plan.  The options expire
            five years from the date of grant.

            A summary of the Plans' activities  for  the years ended April 30,
            1994 and 1993 is as follows:

      (6)   Supplemental Cash Flow Information and Financing Activities

            During  1994, the Company acquired two aircraft for $1,284,000.
            The purchases were financed with the seller.

            Additionally  in 1994, the Company entered into an agreement to
            acquire up to 28%  of  a  corporate joint venture.  In 1994 the
            Company  acquired  a  13.6% interest  of  the  corporate  joint
            venture in exchange for  a  helicopter  and  equipment with net
            values  totaling  $439,000.   The Company further  has  a  note
            receivable  for  $290,000  from the  joint  venture  which  the
            Company has the option to convert  into  an  additional 9.3% of
            the common stock of the corporate joint venture.

      (7)   Commitments and Contingencies

            The  Company  leases  certain aircraft used in its  operations.
            The Company generally pays all insurance, taxes and maintenance
            expenses associated with  these  aircraft,  and  some  of these
            leases contain renewal and purchase options.

            Aggregate  rental commitments to lease aircraft under operating
            leases are due  in  years  subsequent  to  April  30,  1994, as
            follows:

            The  Company has agreed to purchase two helicopters in 1995  for  $5
      million.  The  Company  also  plans to lease five helicopters with a lease
      value of $9 million.  The lease term is 60 months with monthly payments of
      $67,000 or $0.8 million per year.   At  the  end  of  the  lease term, the
      Company may purchase the aircraft for 88% of the original lease,  or  $7.9
      million,  or  return  the  aircraft and pay the lessor 13% of the original
      lease  amount,  or  $1.2  million.   The  Company  also   has  non-binding
      agreements to purchase 15 additional  aircraft  none of which are expected
      to be purchased in 1995.

            The  Company  is  subject  to certain legal proceedings  which  have
      arisen in the ordinary course of its  business  and  have not been finally
      adjudicated.  In connection with this litigation, the  Company has accrued
      estimated amounts which it believes adequately provide for  the settlement
      of such litigation.

      leasehold interest in each EMS Aircraft.

           (b)       Each EMS Aircraft meets (i) the IER noted in  its  EMS
      Lease or EMS Contract and (ii) the FAA 135 airworthiness criteria.

           (c)       All  of the EMS Aircraft, in the aggregate, shall have
      been maintained to aircraft  maintenance conditions of at least fifty
      (50%) percent time/life remaining.

           2    EMS Contracts and EMS  Leases.   Each  EMS Contract and EMS
      Lease  shall  be  validly assumed by the Debtor and assigned  to  the
      Operator on the Effective Date and all EMS Contract Cure Amounts
      
      <PAGE>

      shall be paid or adequately reserved by the Debtor or the Liquidating
      Trustee as of the Effective  Date  (or  by  AEC to the limited extent
      provided in Section 4.1(a) of the Plan).  Each  EMS  Contract and EMS
      Lease is in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance  with
      its  terms  and  other than defaults that will be cured by payment by
      the Debtor (or by  AEC  to  the  limited  extent  provided in Section
      6.1(a) of the Plan) of the EMS Contract Cure Amounts, there exists no
      default  or event of default or event, occurrence, condition  or  act
      that, with  the  giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening
      of any other event  or  condition, would become a default or event of
      default thereunder.  Other  than  failures to make payments that will
      be cured by payment of the EMS Contract  Cure  Amounts,  none  of the
      Debtors  has  violated  any  of  the  terms  or conditions of any EMS
      Contract or EMS Lease and all of the covenants to be performed by any
      other  party  to  any  EMS  Contract  or  EMS Lease have  been  fully
      performed.

           3    EMS Other Property.  The Debtors are the sole and exclusive
      record owners of all of the EMS Other Property.

           4    Environmental Matters.  The Debtors  are  and  have been in
      compliance  with,  in  all  material respects, and there has been  no
      violation of, any laws or regulations  with  respect  to pollution or
      protection  of  the environment arising out of the Debtors'  past  or
      present ownership  or use of the EMS Assets or in connection with the
      conduct of the EMS Business.   There  is  no  pending  or  threatened
      lawsuit  or administrative proceeding before any Governmental  Entity
      against the Debtors with respect to environmental compliance, control
      or liability  relating  to  the  EMS  Assets  or EMS Business and the
      Debtors  have no knowledge of any facts or circumstances  that  could
      form the basis  of a claim, citation or allegation against any of the
      Debtors  for  a  violation  of,  or  alleging  liability  under,  any
      environmental laws.   No tank for the storage of hazardous substances
      or wastes or petroleum  products is located on or under any EMS Asset
      other than on EMS Aircraft,  and  no  Debtor has any knowledge of the
      existence  of any liabilities or potential  liabilities  against  any
      Debtor associated with any such tank located on or under any property
      that is not an EMS Asset.

           5    Employment  Relations and Benefits.  (a)  There is no labor
      union that claims to represent  the  employees  of  any Debtor and no
      collective  bargaining  agreement currently being negotiated  by  any
      Debtor with respect to its employees.

           (b)       None of the  Debtors maintains nor has ever maintained
      any employee benefit plan that  is  a multi- employer plan as defined
      in Section 3(37) of ERISA or a plan under Title IV of ERISA.

           6    Insurance.  The Debtors maintain  in  full force and effect
      fire,  comprehensive  general liability, aircraft liability,  product
      liability,  aircraft  replacement   and   hull,   helipad,   workers'
      compensation,  and  other  insurance  policies that, with respect  to
      their amounts and types of coverage, are  adequate  to  insure  fully
      against risks to which the EMS Assets are normally exposed in the
      
      <PAGE>

      operation   of  the  EMS  Business  and  comply  with  all  insurance
      maintenance requirements  in  the  EMS Contracts and EMS Leases.  All
      premiums payable under such policies  have  been  paid  in  full,  no
      notice  of  cancellation  of  any  such policy has been received, and
      there is no existing default or event that, with the giving of notice
      or  lapse  of time or both, would constitute  a  default  thereunder.
      There are no  claims  in existence or pending under such policies and
      no circumstances likely to give rise to any such claim.

      SECTION 6.  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

           1    EMS Contracts and EMS Leases.  (a) Within twenty days after
      the Confirmation Date, the Operator shall, in accordance with Section
      6.1  of the Plan, file an application for assumption  and  assignment
      (the "Application")  and  any  other  appropriate  pleadings with the
      Bankruptcy  Court,  in  the name of the appropriate Debtor,  for  the
      Debtors to assume and to assign to the Operator each EMS Contract and
      EMS Lease except any EMS Contract or EMS Lease
      
      <PAGE>

      excluded by AEC and the Operator.   Except  to the extent provided in
      Section 4.1 of the Plan, the Debtors shall bear  the  entire  cost of
      all  such  assignments, including without limitation, the payment  of
      any EMS Contract  Cure  Amounts.   The  Application  shall  include a
      statement  of  the EMS Contract Cure Amounts proposed by the Operator
      to be paid and shall  further provide a date by which the contracting
      party may object to the  Application.  The Debtors or the Liquidating
      Trustee  shall  cure  all defaults  and  otherwise  comply  with  the
      requirements of Section  365(b)  of  Bankruptcy  Code with respect to
      each such EMS Contract and EMS Lease and shall (except  to the extent
      provided  in  Section  4.1  of  the Plan), pay all EMS Contract  Cure
      Amounts.

           (b)       On the Effective Date,  the Debtors shall be deemed to
      have assumed each such EMS Contract or EMS  Lease.   The EMS Contract
      Cure  Amounts relating to each such EMS Contract or EMS  Lease  shall
      conclusively  be  determined  to  be  the  amount  set  forth  in the
      Application  to  the extent no objection is filed thereto, or if such
      an objection is filed,  as set forth in the Final Order approving the
      Application in accordance with Section 6.1 of the Plan.

           2    Determination  of   Allowed   EMS   Secured   Claims.   The
      Bankruptcy Court shall determine the extent to which each EMS Secured
      Claim  shall  be  an  Allowed EMS Secured Claim.  Such determinations
      shall be made pursuant  to  (i)  actions  previously commenced by the
      Debtors, provided that the Operator shall be  entitled to participate
      in any such actions as a party in interest, and at the sole option of
      the  Operator,  after  the  Confirmation Date the Operator  shall  be
      substituted for the Debtor as  the true party in interest in any such
      pending actions, or (ii) motions  filed  by  the Operator pursuant to
      Bankruptcy Rule 3012 and Section 506(a) of the  Bankruptcy Code.  The
      Debtors  shall  cooperate  with the Operator in connection  with  the
      Bankruptcy Court's determination  of  the  extent  to  which each EMS
      Secured Claim shall be an Allowed EMS Secured Claim.

           3    Treatment of AEC and DCC Leases.  Notwithstanding any other
      provision of this Agreement, pursuant to the Plan each EMS Lease that
      is an AEC Lease or a DCC Lease shall be assumed and assigned  to  the
      Operator,  such assignment to be effective on the Effective Date, and
      the Operator  shall  thereafter  perform  all  the obligations of the
      lessee thereunder.

           4    Due Diligence Review.  For the period from the date of this
      Agreement to the Effective Date, the Debtors shall  make  or cause to
      be  made  available at Debtors' offices for examination and reproduc-
      tion by the  officers,  attorneys,  accountants  and other authorized
      representatives  of  AEC  and  each  Operator during normal  business
      hours,  all  documents  of  every  kind  and  character  in  Debtors'
      possession or to which Debtors have access  relating  or  in  any way
      pertaining  to  the  EMS  Business  or EMS Assets, including, without
      limitation, all EMS Contracts and EMS  Leases,  and the IER and other
      maintenance records for each EMS Aircraft.  The Debtors shall furnish
      the representatives with all information that the
      
      <PAGE>

      representatives may reasonably request and Debtors  shall cause their
      employees, accountants and attorneys to cooperate fully with
      the  representatives in connection with their review and  examination
      and to  make  full disclosure of all material facts affecting the EMS
      Business and EMS  Assets.   The  representatives shall be entitled to
      inspect each EMS Aircraft and, in  connection  with  such inspection,
      perform a flight test to determine that all systems and equipment are
      in  proper  working  order.  During such investigation, AEC  and  the
      Operator shall have the  right  to make copies of such records, files
      and other materials as they may reasonably deem advisable.

           5    Governmental Approvals.  (a) The Parties shall cooperate in
      good  faith  and  take  all  actions  necessary   or  appropriate  to
      expeditiously and diligently file all applications and documents with
      the FAA and the Department of Transportation in order  to  assign and
      transfer  the  FAA  Certificate  to  the Operator and take such other
      necessary  or  appropriate  actions  to  obtain  the  FAA's  and  the
      Department of Transportation's approval of  the  Transactions  and of
      the assignment of the FAA Certificate to the Operator.

           (b)       The  Debtors  and  the  Operator  shall  each file and
      maintain or cause to be filed and maintained with the FTC and the DOJ
      any HSR Notifications required to be filed by their "ultimate parent"
      companies under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
      thereunder with respect to the Transactions.  Each Party  shall  make
      such  filings  as soon as practicable but in no event later than five
      Business Days after  the  Confirmation Date, shall cooperate with the
      other Parties in accomplishing  such filings, respond promptly to any
      request for additional information  made  by  either  the FTC or DOJ,
      shall keep the other Parties apprised of the status of  any inquiries
      made  by the DOJ or FTC and shall use its best efforts to  cause  the
      waiting  periods  under  the  HSR  Act  to terminate or expire at the
      earliest possible date.  Each Party shall  also  use  all  reasonable
      efforts  to  resist  vigorously at its cost and expense any assertion
      that the Transactions constitute a violation of the antitrust laws.

           (c)       To the  extent permitted by applicable law, each Party
      shall promptly provide the  other  Parties with copies of all written
      communications, letters, reports or  other  documents delivered to or
      received from Governmental Entities in connection  with  the  filings
      contemplated by this subsection, and copies of any written memorandum
      relating  to discussions with such Governmental Entities with respect
      to such filings.

           6    Confidentiality  of  Information.    If  this  Agreement is
      terminated prior to the Effective Date for any reason, AEC  and  each
      Operator  shall,  to  the  extent  reasonably practicable, destroy or
      cause to be delivered to the Debtors all documents and other material
      obtained  by  it  in  connection with the  transactions  contemplated
      hereby (and copies thereof),  whether  obtained  before  or after the
      execution  hereof,  and  no Party shall use or disclose, directly  or
      indirectly, any information  so obtained, or otherwise obtained by it
      hereunder  or  in  connection herewith,  and  shall  cause  all  such
      information to be kept confidential and not used in any
      
      <PAGE>

      way detrimental to any  other Party.  AEC and each Operator shall use
      its best efforts to keep  confidential  the documents and information
      furnished that are designated as "confidential"  by  Debtors  and, if
      this Agreement is terminated, such confidence shall be maintained and
      all   such   documents  and  all  copies  thereof  shall  immediately
      thereafter be  returned  to Debtors;  provided, however, that AEC and
      each Operator shall not be  obligated to use its best efforts to keep
      confidential any document or  information  that  (a) was  or  becomes
      generally  available  to  the  public  other  than  as  a  result  of
      disclosure  by  Debtors or (b) was or becomes available to AEC or any
      Operator other than as a result of disclosure by Debtors.

           7    Conduct  of  Debtors'  EMS Business; Use of EMS Assets.  At
      all times prior to the Effective Date,  the Debtors shall (i) conduct
      the  EMS  Business  in  the  ordinary  course  consistent  with  past
      practices, keep available the services of its officers  and employees
      and  maintain  good  relationships  with  its  customers,  suppliers,
      distributors,  vendors,  agents,  representatives,  consultants   and
      others  having  business  relationships with them; (ii) not commit or
      omit  to do any act that would  cause  them  to  breach  any  of  the
      agreements,  commitments  or  covenants  contained in this Agreement;
      (iii) continue to operate and maintain the  EMS Assets diligently and
      substantially in the same manner as heretofore  conducted  so  as  to
      minimize  risk  of  material deterioration, damage and loss to any of
      the EMS Assets; (iv)  maintain in full force and effect the insurance
      policies carried on the  EMS  Assets existing on the date hereof; and
      (v)  not  institute  any  new  methods   of  purchase,  sale,  lease,
      management, accounting or operation or engage  in  any transaction or
      activity, enter into any agreement or make any commitment  that  will
      affect  the  operation  or  use of the EMS Assets after the Effective
      Date, except in the ordinary course consistent with past practices.

           8    Employees.  On the  Effective  Date, the Operator may offer
      employment, in the same or similar position  and  with  the  same  or
      similar responsibilities as with Debtors, to substantially all active
      employees of the Debtors performing services directly assigned to the
      EMS Contracts who meet or exceed the Operator's employee requirements
      for  such  position.   For  purposes of this subsection 6.7, the term
      "active employee" shall mean  any  person who, on the Effective Date,
      is actively employed by any Debtor or who is on short-term disability
      leave, vacation, jury duty leave, sick  leave,  or  other  authorized
      leave  of  absence,  military  service  or  lay-off with a reasonable
      expectation of recall as of the Effective Date  but shall exclude any
      inactive or former employee, including any person  who  has  been  on
      long-term  disability  leave  or unauthorized leave of absence or who
      has terminated his or her employment  (voluntarily or involuntarily),
      retired  or  died on or before the Effective  Date.   Nothing  herein
      shall be deemed  to  require  the Operator to offer employment to any
      particular employee.
      
      <PAGE>

           9    Accounts Receivable.   (a)   At  the  Closing,  the Debtors
      shall  assign  to the Operator, for purposes of collection only,  all
      Accounts Receivable.   The  Debtors  or the Liquidating Trustee shall
      deliver to the Operator on, or as soon as practicable after, the
      Effective Date a complete and detailed  statement  showing  the name,
      amount  and age of each Accounts Receivable.  The Operator shall  use
      its best  efforts  to collect the Accounts Receivable for a period of
      ninety days after the Effective Date (the "Collection Period").

           (b)       During the Collection Period, the Operator shall remit
      to the Liquidating Trustee on a monthly basis any accounts receivable
      collected  by the Operator  relating  to  any  services  rendered  in
      connection with  the  conduct  of  the  EMS  Business  prior  to  the
      Effective  Date.   The  Operator  shall  credit  sums  to  the oldest
      outstanding  balance  due from any account debtor unless the Operator
      receives  other remittance  instructions  from  the  account  debtors
      specifically  identified  in  the  invoices being paid.  The Operator
      shall not be obligated to use any extraordinary  efforts  to  collect
      any  of  the accounts receivable relating to the EMS Assets prior  to
      the Effective  Date  or  refer  any  such  accounts  receivable  to a
      collection  agency  or to an attorney for collection and the Operator
      shall not make any such  referral  or compromise nor settle or adjust
      the amount of any such accounts receivable  except  with the approval
      of the Liquidating Trustee.  The Operator shall incur no liability to
      the  Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee for any uncollected  account.
      None of the Debtors, the Liquidating Trustee, or the agents of either
      of them  shall  make  any  solicitation  of these accounts during the
      Collection Period.

           (c)       On or before the fifteenth  day  after  the end of the
      Collection Period, the Operator shall (i) furnish the Debtors  or the
      Liquidating  Trustee  a  list  of  all  Accounts Receivable that then
      remain uncollected, together with any files concerning the collection
      or attempts to collect such Accounts Receivable  and  payment  of any
      remaining unremitted amounts and (ii) reassign to the Debtors or  the
      Liquidating Trustee any uncollected Accounts Receivable.  Thereafter,
      the  Operator  shall  have  no  further  obligation or liability with
      respect  to  Accounts  Receivable,  except that  the  Operator  shall
      immediately pay over to the Debtors or  the  Liquidating  Trustee any
      amount subsequently paid to the Operator and determined in accordance
      with  the foregoing procedures to be a payment of any such reassigned
      Accounts Receivable.

           10   Mail  and  Other  Communications.   (a)  The Debtors hereby
      authorize the Operator from and after the Effective  Date  to receive
      and  open all mail and other communications addressed to the  Debtors
      received  by  the  Operator, and to act with respect to such mail and
      other communications in such manner as the Operator may elect if such
      mail and other communications  relate  to  the  EMS  Business  or EMS
      Assets, or if such mail and other communications do not so relate, to
      forward such mail and other communications promptly to the Debtors or
      the Liquidating Trustee.

      <PAGE>

           (b)       After  the  Effective Date, the Debtors shall promptly
      deliver  to  the  Operator  the   original   of  any  mail  or  other
      communication  received  by  it  relating to operations  of  the  EMS
      Business   or  EMS  Assets  after  the  Effective   Date,   including
      specifically  invoices related to such period, and any monies, checks
      or other instruments of payment to which the Operator is
      entitled, and the  Operator  shall promptly deliver to the Debtors or
      the  Liquidating  Trustee  the  original   of   any   mail  or  other
      communication  received  by  it  relating  to operations of  the  EMS
      Business  or  EMS  Assets  prior  to  the Effective  Date,  including
      specifically invoices related to such period,  and any monies, checks
      or  instruments of payment to which the Debtors are  entitled,  other
      than   Accounts   Receivable,  which  will  be  handled  pursuant  to
      subsection 6.9 of this Agreement.

           11   Notification of Changes.  Debtors shall promptly notify AEC
      and the Operator of  (i)  any  event  that could adversely affect the
      ability of Debtors to perform any of its  agreements,  commitments or
      covenants contained herein, or (ii) any event or condition that could
      be reasonably expected to results in a material adverse change in the
      EMS Business or EMS Assets.

           12   Cooperation  and Best Efforts.  Each Party shall  cooperate
      with  the  others and use  its  best  efforts  to  (a)  procure  upon
      reasonable terms and conditions all necessary consents and approvals,
      (b) complete  all  necessary filings, registrations and certificates,
      (c)  satisfy  all  requirements   prescribed  by  law  for,  and  all
      conditions set forth in this Agreement  to,  the  consummation of the
      Transactions  and  (d)  effect  the  Transactions  at  the   earliest
      practicable date.

      SECTION 9.  COVENANTS BETWEEN AEC AND THE OPERATOR

           1    Reimbursement  of  Cash  Purchase Price.  Within 45 days of
      the  last day of each calendar quarter  ending  after  the  Effective
      Date, the Operator shall pay to AEC or its designee five (5%) percent
      of gross  revenues  under  each  EMS  Contract  for services actually
      rendered  (including  any  renewal,  extension,  restatement   and/or
      replacement thereof) during such calendar quarter until the first  to
      occur  of  (i)  the  fifth  anniversary of the Effective Date or (ii)
      termination of such EMS Contract  (including  any renewal, extension,
      restatement and/or replacement thereof) (and thereafter to the extent
      attributable   to   gross  revenue  prior  to  such  anniversary   or
      termination); provided that in no event shall the payments under this
      subsection 9.1 as to  any  such EMS Contract exceed five (5%) percent
      of projected gross revenue under  such  EMS  Contract,  as  projected
      prior  to the Effective Date by AEC and the Operator, such projection
      to be based  upon  then  (pre-Effective  Date) current gross revenues
      under  such  EMS  Contract,  assuming  a  term ending  on  the  fifth
      anniversary  of  the  Effective Date and escalated  on  each  interim
      anniversary date by 2.74%;  and  provided  further, that in the event
      Operator voluntarily agrees to an amendment or modification of an EMS
      Contract prior to the fifty anniversary of the  Effective  Date  that
      results  in  a diminution or deferral of the gross revenues otherwise
      earnable by or payable to Operator under such EMS Contract, for which
      the Operator will  be  compensated in a manner that is not subject to
      the royalty provision of this Section 9.1, then and in such event the
      Operator will pay to AEC or its designee the greater of (i) the gross
      
      <PAGE>

      revenues under such EMS  Contract  or (ii) the amount of royalty that
      it would otherwise have paid to AEC  under  this Section 9.1 based on
      gross  revenue  under  such  EMS  Contract for the  calendar  quarter
      immediately  prior  to  the amendment  or  modification  of  the  EMS
      Contract.  Payments under this subsection 9.1 shall be reduced to the
      extent all net adjustments pursuant to subsection 2.3(b) of
      this Agreement attributable  to  the EMS Assets result in a reduction
      to the Cash Purchase Price, such reduction  to be made beginning with
      the  first  such  quarterly  payment  and  shall continue  with  each
      subsequent quarterly payment until the full amount of such adjustment
      has been recouped.  If the adjustments pursuant  to subsection 2.3(b)
      of  this  Agreement  attributable  to  the  EMS Assets result  in  an
      increase to the Cash Purchase Price, such increase  shall  be paid by
      the Operator to AEC within five (5) business days after the Effective
      Date.

           2    Aircraft  Equity.   If an EMS Contract terminates prior  to
      the expiration of the five year period referred to in subsection 9.1,
      then to the extent (i) the fair market value (determined prior to the
      Effective Date pursuant to a single appraiser jointly selected by AEC
      and the Operator) of  any  financed  EMS Aircraft directly related to
      such  EMS Contract exceeds (ii) the Allowed  EMS  Secured  Claim  and
      similar  or  related  obligations  attributable  to such EMS Aircraft
      computed as of the Effective Date (such excess amount,  the "Aircraft
      Equity"),  then  the  Operator  will  continue  to pay to AEC or  its
      designee the amounts that would have been paid under  subsection  9.1
      (based on payments made immediately prior to such termination if such
      EMS  Contract  had not terminated prior to the expiration of the five
      year period referred  to  in  subsection 9.1), and a final payment at
      the expiration of such five year  period, if necessary, in the amount
      of any shortfall from the projections  referred to in subsection 9.1,
      provided  that  in no event will the aggregate  payments  under  this
      subsection 9.2 exceed the amount of the Aircraft Equity.

           3    Lease Rates.   From  and after the Effective Date, each EMS
      Aircraft previously leased to the  Debtors  pursuant  to an EMS Lease
      that is an AEC Lease or DCC Lease shall be leased by AEC  or  DCC  to
      the Operator at rates and on other terms and conditions equivalent to
      the  pre-bankruptcy,  pre-default  lease rates applicable to such EMS
      Aircraft.

           4    Return  of  EMS  Aircraft.   If   any   EMS   Contract   is
      unilaterally  terminated  by  the  hospital  or expires or terminates
      pursuant  to  the  terms of such contract within  18  months  of  the
      Effective Date for any  reason  other  than  the  malfeasance  of the
      Operator, then the Operator shall have the right (exercisable without
      penalty on or after the first year anniversary of the date of such  a
      termination)  to  cancel each lease instrument in respect of each AEC
      or DCC leased EMS Aircraft  directly related to such EMS Contract and
      return such EMS Aircraft to AEC,  DCC  or  its  designee.   Upon such
      return,  the  EMS Aircraft will comply in all material respects  with
      the maintenance  return conditions contained in the applicable lease.
      During such one year  interim  period,  the Operator shall be free to
      redeploy and modify such EMS Aircraft in
      
      <PAGE>

      an effort to mitigate the cost incurred during  such period, provided
      that  such  EMS Aircraft will be returned in the original  lease  IER
      configuration.

           5    Right   of   First  Offer.   To  the  extent  permitted  by
      applicable law, if an EMS Contract is not assigned, for any reason
      whatsoever, to any other  operator  pursuant  to  another  EMS  Asset
      Purchase  Agreement, or otherwise, the Operator shall be entitled  to
      access to information  regarding,  and to evaluate, such EMS Contract
      and the related EMS Assets and to make  an initial proposal regarding
      such EMS Contract.

           6    Audit Rights.  In connection with  the  preparation  of the
      Operator's   audited   annual  financial  statements  the  Operator's
      independent auditors shall  provide  AEC  and its auditors with (i) a
      letter  certifying the accuracy of the gross  revenues  received  and
      royalty payments made pursuant to Section 9 hereof in connection with
      each EMS  Contract  and (ii) the opportunity to meet and discuss such
      revenues and payments; provided, that if the Operator does not engage
      independent auditors  at  any time during the term of this Agreement,
      the Operator shall provide,  at  its  expense,  AEC  and its auditors
      reasonable  access  to  its  books  and records relating to  the  EMS
      Contract on an annual basis.

           7    Confirmation  of  the  Plan.   (a)   AEC  shall,  with  the
      reasonable cooperation of the Operator,  use its best efforts to file
      and prosecute to confirmation the Plan and  shall  not,  without  the
      prior  written  consent  of  the Operator, which consent shall not be
      unreasonably withheld, (i) withdraw  or modify the Plan, (ii) support
      the  confirmation  of  any  other  plan of  reorganization,  plan  of
      liquidation or motion to convert to Chapter 7 filed in the Chapter 11
      Cases,  or  (iii)  take  any  action in the  Chapter  11  Cases  that
      diminishes the value of the Plan or this Agreement to the Operator.

           (b)  If at any time after  filing  and prior to the Confirmation
      Date the Plan is determined (in the reasonable  judgment  of AEC, the
      Operator,  and  the   operators  under  the  other EMS Asset Purchase
      Agreements) to provide funds available for payment  to  the  class of
      Unsecured  Creditors (as defined in the Plan) in an amount less  than
      that  provided   pursuant   to   any   other   confirmable   plan  of
      reorganization (as determined in the reasonable judgment of AEC,  the
      Operators  and  the  operators  under  the  other  EMS Asset Purchase
      Agreement) then on file and being prosecuted by its proponents in the
      Chapter 11 Cases, then:

           (i)       AEC  shall  commence  discussions  with  the  Operator
      and/or  the other operators that are parties to the other  EMS  Asset
      Purchase Agreements for the purpose of increasing the funds available
      for payment to such class of Unsecured Creditors; and
      
      <PAGE>

           (ii)      if  such  discussions  do not result in an increase in
      the funds so available for such class of  unsecured  creditors  to an
      amount at least equivalent to all other such plans in the Chapter  11
      Cases,  then  either  AEC or the Operator may elect to terminate this
      Agreement by notice to  the  other,  such termination to be effective
      three (3) business days after receipt of such notice.

      SECTION 10.  TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT
