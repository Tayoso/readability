ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
(A) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
     Through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, FHP International
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), delivers managed health
care services and sells indemnity health, group life and workers' compensation
insurance. The Company's oldest and largest subsidiary, FHP, Inc., a California
corporation ("FHP"), is a federally qualified multistate licensed health
maintenance organization ("HMO"), which has been operating managed health care
programs since 1961. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Company"
as used in this Form 10-K Annual Report refers to FHP International Corporation
and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including FHP and TakeCare, Inc. and
its subsidiaries ("TakeCare").
 
     The Company provides a broad range of managed health care services to
approximately 1,712,000 HMO members, comprised of commercial and governmental
employees and Medicare beneficiaries, in California, Colorado, Arizona, Utah,
Illinois, Ohio, New Mexico, Nevada and Guam. These managed health care services
include ambulatory and outpatient physician care, hospital care, pharmacy,
dental care, eye care, home health nursing, skilled nursing, physical therapy,
psychological counseling and health education.
 
     The Company also offers group life and health insurance products through
its insurance subsidiaries. At June 30, 1994, the Company provided group term
life insurance coverage for approximately 63,000 individuals and group health
and accident indemnity insurance coverage for approximately 48,000 individuals.
In its 24 Hour Managed Care ProgramSM the Company offers in a single package
workers' compensation coverage, HMO plans and group indemnity medical, dental
and life insurance benefit plans through several of its subsidiaries. The
Company also offers third party administration and utilization review services
and several PPO networks.
 
     In October 1993, FHP acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of
Aetna Health Plans of Colorado, Inc., an IPA model HMO with approximately 4,700
members, for an aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustment, of $3.5
million. Upon consummation of the acquisition, Aetna Health Plans of Colorado,
Inc. was renamed FHP of Colorado, Inc. In May 1994, FHP of Texas, Inc. became
licensed as an HMO in the State of Texas and expects to begin providing
healthcare to HMO members in the Houston, Texas area effective October 1, 1994.
 
     On June 17, 1994, the Company consummated the acquisition of TakeCare by
merging TakeCare with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
TakeCare, through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, is a managed health care
company that provides comprehensive health care services to approximately
786,000 HMO members as of June 30, 1994, in California, Colorado, Illinois and
Ohio. In September 1993, TakeCare acquired Comprecare, Inc. ("Comprecare"), a
178,000-member HMO in Colorado, making TakeCare the largest HMO in Colorado.
 
     In connection with the acquisition of TakeCare, the Company entered into a
Credit Agreement, dated as of March 24, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the
Company, the lenders named therein and Chemical Bank, as Administrative Agent.
The Credit Agreement provides for a $250 million five-year term loan facility
and a $100 million five-year revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement
contains financial and other covenants, including limitations on indebtedness,
liens, dividends, sale and lease-back transactions and certain other
transactions.
 
     At June 30, 1994, the Company had approximately 14,000 full and part-time
employees. The Company's primary business activities consist of two business
segments: HMO services and group life, health and accident and workers'
compensation insurance. Information concerning revenue, operating profit or loss
and identifiable assets of the Company's two business segments is set forth in
the financial statements and relative notes included in Part II of this Form
10-K.
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   4
 
(B) HMO DELIVERY MODELS
 
     The Company operates primarily through two different HMO delivery models.
The Company delivers health care services through independent practice
association and group model HMOs in which the Company contracts with individual
medical and dental providers, provider networks and multi-specialty medical
groups to provide healthcare in facilities not operated by the Company. The term
"IPA" used hereafter in this Form 10-K Annual Report refers to both of these
contractual HMO models. Each IPA model centers around one or more contract
hospitals where IPA physicians maintain practice privileges. The Company's
members receive health care through the offices of more than 41,000 independent
contract providers and more than 500 contract hospitals.
 
     In its staff model, the Company delivers health care services through an
employed staff of primary health care physicians, physician specialists,
dentists, nurses and other health care providers. These providers deliver health
care to members in Company-operated facilities rather than in the offices of
private doctors and dentists. At June 30, 1994, the Company employed
approximately 800 primary care physicians and physician specialists, 200
dentists and 6,000 other health care professionals. Company-operated facilities
include 59 medical and dental care centers ranging in size from approximately
2,000 to 96,000 square feet, three acute care hospitals and two sub-acute
skilled nursing facilities.
 
     In a number of the Company's service areas, members receive health care in
mixed models where members have a choice of seeing either independent
contracting physicians in their offices or staff physicians employed at
Company-operated medical centers. This mixed model combines elements of both the
Company's staff and IPA models. The Company also offers its members IPA models
in certain areas previously served only by its staff model operations.
 
(C) HMO MEMBERSHIP
 
     Commercial Members. As used herein, the term commercial members means all
HMO members except Senior PlanSM members. The Company acquires most of its
commercial members by contracting with employers that offer health benefits to
their employees. These employers generally offer a selection of insurance and
managed health care plans, pay for all or part of the monthly costs thereof and
make payroll deductions for any costs payable by the employee. Supplemental
benefits such as dental and eye care are often included as part of employer
health benefit plans. During a designated open enrollment period, employees may
select their desired health care coverage. Monthly premiums are negotiated
between the Company and the employers, and are typically fixed for a one-year
period. Commercial members, including TakeCare membership, comprised
approximately 80% of the Company's total membership at June 30, 1994.
 
     Senior Plan Members. The Company also delivers managed health care services
to Medicare beneficiaries under its Senior Plan pursuant to contracts with the
Health Care Financing Administration of the United States Department of Health
and Human Services ("HCFA"). These contracts entitle the Company to a fixed fee
per member premium, and are subject to adjustment annually based on certain
demographic information relating to the Medicare population, and the cost of
providing health care in a particular geographic area. Senior Plan membership
comprised approximately 35% of the Company's total membership (excluding
TakeCare membership) at June 30, 1994, but accounted for approximately 65% of
the Company's total revenue for the fiscal year. Including TakeCare membership,
Senior Plan membership comprised 20% of the Company's total membership at June
30, 1994. The Company receives substantially more revenue for each Senior Plan
member than it receives for each commercial member.
 
     In addition to physician care, hospitalization and other benefits covered
by Medicare, Senior Plan benefits also include prescription drugs, routine
physical exams, hearing tests, immunizations, eye examinations, counseling and
health education services. Senior Plan members are enrolled on an individual
basis and may disenroll at any time. Medicare beneficiaries can also choose to
enroll in the Senior Plan PlusSM program which offers more comprehensive medical
and dental benefits. Seniors who enroll in this plan pay a small monthly
premium.
 
                                        2
<PAGE>   5
 
     The Company anticipates further growth opportunities for its Senior Plan,
based in part on demographic trends that show that the senior population is
growing faster than any other segment of the nation's population. The Company is
currently one of the largest providers of health care services to Medicare
beneficiaries in the United States.
 
     The following table shows an approximate breakdown of the Company's HMO
membership at June 30, 1994:

(D) INSURANCE OPERATIONS
 
     The Company also offers group health and life insurance products through
its insurance subsidiaries. At June 30, 1994, the Company provided group term
life insurance coverage for approximately 63,000 individuals and group health
and accident indemnity coverage for approximately 48,000 individuals.
 
     24 Hour Managed Care Program. The Company operates a 24 Hour Managed Care
Program, which provides HMO and preferred provider organization
("PPO")/indemnity medical coverage and workers' compensation coverage in one
coordinated managed care system. Through this program, both occupational and
nonoccupational injuries and illnesses are covered by products offered in a
single package and administered on a coordinated basis in a managed care system.
As of June 30, 1994, the 24 Hour Managed Care Program provided services to
approximately 125 employer groups for approximately 16,000 insured employees.
 
(E) GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
     Most of the Company's HMO subsidiaries are qualified under the federal
Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as amended (the "HMO Act"). In
addition, each of the states in which the Company does business has enacted
statutes regulating or affecting the HMO subsidiaries. As a result, the Company
is subject to extensive regulation regarding the scope of benefits provided to
HMO members and the terms of group benefit agreements, the Company's financial
condition, including minimum tangible net equity, quality assurance and
utilization review procedures, enrollment requirements, manner of structuring
member premiums, member grievance procedures, provider contracts, marketing and
advertising. Changes in govern-
 
                                        3
<PAGE>   6
 
mental regulations could adversely affect the operations, profitability and
business prospects of the HMO subsidiaries.
 
     Certain minimum tangible net equity and other financial viability
requirements are imposed on the Company's HMO and insurance subsidiaries by
regulatory authorities in each state in which these subsidiaries operate and
restrict the Company's ability to transfer cash and short-term investments from
such subsidiaries to the Company. While the Company currently believes its
regulated subsidiaries are in compliance with these minimum tangible net equity
and other financial viability requirements, a change in these requirements or an
adverse determination by one or more regulatory authorities could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's ability to make timely payments on
preferred stock dividend obligations and principal and interest obligations
under its Credit Agreement and its 7% Senior Notes due 2003. In order to obtain
approvals for HMO and insurance company expansions into additional states, the
regulated subsidiaries are required to meet certain minimum capital, surplus and
deposit requirements which may require the Company to make additional capital
contributions to such subsidiaries.
 
     The Company's Senior Plan services are provided under contracts with, and
are subject to regulation by, HCFA and certain state agencies. HCFA requires
that an HMO be federally qualified in order to be eligible for Medicare
fixed-fee-per-member contracts. Under the Company's Medicare contracts and HCFA
regulations, if the premiums received for Medicare-covered health care services
provided to Senior Plan members are more than the premiums received for the same
health care services provided to non-Senior Plan members, then the Company must
provide its Senior Plan members with additional benefits beyond those required
by Medicare or reduce any of the premiums, deductibles or co-payments that it
may charge. The Company's Senior Plan is not permitted to account for more than
one-half of the Company's total HMO members in each of the Company's geographic
markets as those markets are defined by HCFA. HCFA has the right to audit HMOs
operating under Medicare contracts to determine the quality of care being
rendered and the degree of compliance with HCFA's contracts and regulations.
 
     The Company's Medicare contracts are renewed annually unless the Company or
HCFA elects to terminate the contracts. HCFA may also unilaterally terminate the
Company's Medicare contracts if the Company fails to continue to meet compliance
and eligibility standards. While the federal government may implement changes in
the Medicare risk-based program, the Company believes that the HMO will continue
to be an important factor in the federal government's overall efforts to control
medical costs. However, the loss of Medicare contracts or termination or
modification of the HCFA risk-based Medicare program could have a material
adverse effect on the revenue, profitability and business prospects of the
Company. The services reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid are subject to various
requirements and restrictions imposed by contract law and regulation.
Non-compliance with government regulations could subject the Company to adverse
action by the government. To maintain compliance, the Company will take such
action, or modify its practices, as it deems necessary.
 
     The HMO and insurance subsidiaries of the Company must file periodic
reports with, and their operations are subject to periodic examination by,
federal and state licensing authorities. To remain licensed and accredited, it
is necessary for the Company's HMO and insurance subsidiaries to comply with
various fiscal standards imposed by regulatory authorities and to make changes
from time to time in their services, procedures, structure and marketing
methods. Such changes may be required as a result of amendment to, or other
significant modification of, federal and state laws and regulations controlling
the subsidiaries' operations.
 
     The Company contracts with the United States Office of Personnel Management
("OPM") to provide or arrange managed health care services under the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program for federal employees ("FEHBP"), annuitants
and their dependents. These contracts with OPM and applicable government
regulations establish premium rating requirements for the FEHBP. OPM conducts
periodic audits of its contractors to, among other things, verify that the
premiums established under the OPM contracts are established in compliance with
the community rating and other requirements under the FEHBP.
 
     In May 1993, after conducting a periodic audit of the Company's FEHBP
contracts covering primarily the years 1988 through 1991, OPM sent a draft audit
report to the Company alleging certain defects in the Company's rating practices
under applicable regulatory and contractual requirements, and invited the
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   7
 
Company to comment. Following its evaluation of additional information and
comments which have been provided by the Company, the OPM auditors will issue a
final report; the OPM Audit Resolution Division will then be responsible for
resolving the audit findings. As part of the resolution process, the Audit
Resolution Division may reconsider the findings of the auditors and the
information provided by the Company.
 
     It is likely that the final audit report will recommend that OPM seek a
monetary recovery from the Company, and that such recommended recovery could be
a substantial amount. At this time, the Company's management and legal counsel
are unable to determine the amounts that may be required to be refunded to OPM
to resolve the audit findings. Management currently believes, however, that
after application of available offsets and consideration of established
reserves, amounts ultimately required to be refunded to OPM will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
In addition, management does not currently believe that the audit will have a
material effect on future relations with OPM.
 
     The Company's insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the department of
insurance in each of the states in which they operate. These regulations relate
to, among other things, the terms, administration and marketing of the products
offered and the financial condition of these subsidiaries, and subject these
subsidiaries to periodic audits and continuing oversight. In addition, the
offering of certain new insurance products may require the approval of these
regulatory agencies.
 
     The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all
governmental regulations affecting its business, the violation of which could
have material adverse effect on its operations or financial position.
 
(F) COMPETITION
 
     The health care and insurance industries are highly competitive. The
Company believes that among the most significant competitive factors in the
market are the quality and location of the health care providers, the
comprehensiveness of coverage and the pricing of services. The Company has a
number of competitors, including commercial insurance carriers and other HMOs,
some of which have substantially larger memberships and are better capitalized
than the Company. In addition to insurance carriers and other HMOs, the Company
also competes with fee-for-service physicians, hospitals, and preferred provider
organizations which contract directly with employers, thus by-passing HMOs.
 
     The Company's largest HMO competitor in California is Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan, Inc., which served approximately 4.6 million members in California
at January 1, 1994. In addition to Kaiser, there is at least one other HMO with
more members than the Company in California at January 1, 1994. At June 30,
1994, the Company served approximately 878,000 HMO members in California.
 
     At June 30, 1994, the Company served approximately 303,000 and 170,000 HMO
members in the States of Colorado and Utah, respectively, more members than any
other HMO in these states. The Company believes that Kaiser is its largest
competitor in Colorado and that Intermountain Health Care is its largest
competitor in Utah. At June 30, 1994, the Company served approximately 171,000,
37,000 and 32,000 HMO members in Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada, respectively.
The Company believes that its largest competitors in Arizona are CIGNA
Healthplan of Arizona-Phoenix and Intergroup Prepaid Health Services of Arizona,
that its largest competitor in New Mexico is Lovelace Healthplan, Inc. and that
its largest competitor in Nevada is Health Plan of Nevada. The Company also
believes that Blue Cross/Blue Shield serves a substantial portion of the total
health care markets in California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
 
     At June 30, 1994, the Company served approximately 43,000 and 40,000 HMO
members in Illinois and Ohio, respectively. The Company believes its largest
competitor in Illinois is Chicago HMO, Ltd., and that its largest competitor in
Ohio is ChoiceCare. At June 30, 1994, the Company served approximately 38,000
HMO members in Guam. The largest competitor of the Company in Guam served
approximately 40,000 members at January 1, 1994.
 
     All membership data for other HMOs is obtained from "The InterStudy
Competitive Edge, 1994 Volume 3, Number 2," published by InterStudy Center for
Managed Care Research, a research organization.

     The Company's staff model health care services are provided primarily
through its medical and dental centers ranging in size from approximately 2,000

     The Company currently operates (i) 30 medical and dental centers in
Southern California, of which 10 are owned and 20 are leased; (ii) 7 medical and
dental centers in Utah, of which 6 are owned and 1 is leased; (iii) 12 medical

owns a hospital licensed for 239 beds and manages another hospital licensed for
150 beds in Southern California. In August 1993, the Company opened a hospital
currently licensed for 117 beds in South Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
     The Company owns a 40,000 square foot administrative office building in
Southern California and a 58,000 square foot administrative office building in
Utah. The Company leases administrative offices in more than one dozen states
and public affairs offices in California and Washington, D.C.
 
     On June 30, 1994, the Company owned buildings totaling approximately 1.5
million square feet in size, some of which were subject to outstanding
encumbrances which totaled approximately $2.6 million. At June 30, 1994, the
Company leased approximately 2.1 million square feet of buildings. In addition,
the Company owns undeveloped acreage in California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico,
Nevada and Guam which is held for future development.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     During the ordinary course of business, the Company has become a party to
pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, a significant number of
which involve claims of medical malpractice. Management of the Company is of the
opinion, taking into account its insurance coverage and reserves that have been
established, that the outcome of the currently known legal actions and
proceedings will not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the
consolidated financial position of the Company.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
TAKECARE ACQUISITION
 
     FHP International Corporation acquired TakeCare, Inc. ("TakeCare")
effective June 17, 1994 and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase.
TakeCare operates contract model ("IPA") HMOs in California, Colorado, Illinois
and Ohio. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "Company" as used herein refers
to FHP International Corporation and its direct and indirect subsidiaries
including TakeCare and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The impact of the
TakeCare transaction on fiscal year 1994 operating results of the Company, net
of related expenses, was immaterial. Prospectively, the operating results of the
Company will be impacted by the operating results of the former TakeCare group
of companies, offset by significant additional intangible amortization and
interest expense. The intangible amortization is non-deductible for tax
purposes. Accordingly, the effective tax rate of the Company is expected to
increase from 38.7% for fiscal year 1994 to at least 46.0% for fiscal year 1995.
 
     As a result of the acquisition, the Company has reorganized its operations,
creating three divisions. HMO operations, formerly divided geographically, have
been aligned with the delivery of healthcare, into staff models and IPAs. The
Company's third area of operation is insurance and support services.
 
     The Company has identified certain duplicative facilities and positions and
is in the process of eliminating this duplication. Most facility consolidations
and related employee relocations are located in California. The Company has
eliminated positions in sales, operations, administration and information
services. Other costs related to the acquisition include changes in corporate
identity, including signage and membership cards, and information systems
network and software. The estimated costs associated with these changes have
been recognized in the Company's financial statements at June 30, 1994. There
was no material impact on fiscal year 1994 earnings.
 
REVENUE AND MEMBERSHIP
 
     The Company generates substantially all of its revenue from premiums
received for health care services provided to its HMO members. For the year
ended June 30, 1994, the Company generated approximately 4.4% of its revenue
from the sale of indemnity health, group life and workers' compensation
insurance and related lines of business. This compares to 3.9% for the previous
fiscal year. This increase primarily reflects the inclusion of a full year's
revenue of the Company's workers' compensation subsidiary. The Company
experienced significant revenue growth during the three-year period ended June
30, 1994, primarily due to increases in its HMO membership.
 
     Total HMO membership growth (exclusive of TakeCare HMO members) averaged
13.1% per year during the three-year period ended June 30, 1994 and increased by
10.5% for the year ended June 30, 1994. Membership growth resulted from
expansion of HMO operations into new market areas and increased penetration in
existing markets. Most of this membership growth has occurred in the IPA/mixed
model plans (mixed models include elements of IPA and staff models). As a result
of the TakeCare acquisition, the Company added approximately 786,000 HMO members
which included approximately 20,000 senior members (individuals eligible for
benefits under the federal Medicare program) and 766,000 commercial HMO members
(including federal employees and Medicaid recipients). In October, 1993, the
Company acquired approximately 4,700 members through the purchase of Aetna
Health Plans of Colorado, Inc. Also, the Company began offering its commercial
products in Northern California in fiscal year 1994. In fiscal year 1995, the
Company will begin offering commercial products in Houston, Texas.
 
     Commercial HMO membership (exclusive of TakeCare members) grew 10.7% for
the year ended June 30, 1994, and averaged 11.7% per year during the three-year
period ended June 30, 1994. Senior membership (exclusive of TakeCare members)
grew 10.1% for the year ended June 30, 1994, and averaged 15.9% per year during
the three-year period ended June 30, 1994.
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   17
 
     During the past three fiscal years, the Company has been experiencing
declining HMO membership in certain staff model medical centers in Southern
California. The decline has been greater among commercial members than senior
members, and management believes this has been caused primarily by increased
competition, the economic recession and substantial employment reductions in
several industry sectors. The TakeCare acquisition, a continuing decline in
California staff model membership and substantial IPA/mixed model expansion in
recent years, have resulted in the Company's IPA/mixed model network membership
increasing significantly as a percentage of total membership to approximately
80.0%.
 
     Commercial HMO premium rates increased an average of 5.7% per year over the
three-year period ended June 30, 1994, and increased an average of 2.9% during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. Management believes this decline is the
result of increased competition among HMOs and insurers in the Company's service
areas. Competition may continue to adversely impact the Company's ability to
increase commercial premium rates. A substantial portion of the Company's HMO
commercial premium rate increases becomes effective in January of each year.
Approximately 25.0% of the Company's fiscal year 1994 commercial premium rate
increases became effective in January, 1994.
 
     The Company receives senior premium rate increases from HCFA on January 1
of each year. Senior premium rate increases averaged 6.2% per year during the
three years ended June 30, 1994. Effective January 1, 1994, the Company received
an average 2.0% rate increase for calendar year 1994. Revenue per senior member
is substantially higher than revenue per commercial plan member because senior
members use substantially more health care services. In September, 1994, HCFA
announced the Medicare rate increases that will become effective January 1,
1995. These rate increases become the basis for determining the amounts that
HCFA will pay to the Company. Based upon this announcement, the Company
currently estimates that it will receive an average 5.0% senior premium rate
increase.
 
COST OF HEALTH CARE
 
     The largest factor affecting the Company's profitability is its ability to
manage and control its health care costs. Since the Company receives fixed
monthly premiums, any unusually high number of catastrophic claims (such as
organ transplants and costly premature births) can cause substantial additional
health care costs without any corresponding revenue increases. Periodically, the
Company's results of operations are materially affected by such costs.
Management believes that the Company's cost control measures, which include
risk-sharing arrangements with its contracted medical providers and
administrative and medical review of its health care delivery services, help to
mitigate the effects of rising health care costs.
 
     During the last three years, certain California staff model medical centers
have had high fixed facility and operating costs relative to enrollment,
creating excess capacity and therefore higher health care costs as a percentage
of revenue. Staff model medical centers have a relatively high percentage of
fixed operating costs. Steps taken to address the problem include the
consolidation of four medical centers into two centers over the previous two
fiscal years and implementation of new staff model provider incentives based on,
among other things, member satisfaction and quality of care.
 
     The following table sets forth the percentage relationships of various
income statement items to revenue for the periods indicated:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
  Fiscal Year 1994 Compared to Fiscal Year 1993
 
     Revenue increased 23.3% to $2,473 million for fiscal year 1994 from
$2,005.9 million for fiscal year 1993. Approximately 67.3% of revenue was
generated by IPA and mixed model membership, and approximately 28.3% of revenue
was generated by staff model membership during fiscal year 1994. Approximately
4.4% of the Company's revenue was generated by insurance products and support
services.
 
     Health care costs increased 22.4% to $2,057.7 million for fiscal year 1994
from $1,681.1 million for fiscal year 1993, primarily due to membership growth
during the period. Health care costs decreased to 83.2% of revenue in 1994 from
83.8% in 1993, primarily due to improvement in the Company's health
administration and health operations costs. In addition, pharmacy costs in
Arizona as well as optometry costs in California and Nevada were significantly
reduced. The Company experienced certain health care cost increases during the
year. In Utah, the Company opened its own acute care hospital in August, 1993.
The hospital did not reach break-even occupancy by the end of the fiscal year.
California and Nevada experienced higher physician services costs as a percent
of revenue in fiscal year 1994 than in fiscal year 1993.
 
     General, administrative and marketing ("G & A") expenses increased 23.2% to
$332.2 million for fiscal year 1994 from $269.6 million for the fiscal year
1993, primarily as a result of growth in the Company's operations. G & A
expenses as a percentage of revenue were 13.4% in the fiscal year 1994,
unchanged from 13.4% in the fiscal year 1993. Cost control measures included
hiring freezes, reductions in the Company's work force and administrative
reorganizations.
 
     Net interest income was $13.8 million for fiscal year 1994 as compared to
$14.7 million for the previous year. Net interest income decreased primarily as
the result of interest expense on the $100 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2003
(the "Notes") issued in September, 1993 and a decrease in capitalized interest
of approximately $2 million, due to the completion of several major construction
projects including the Company's Utah hospital. The decreases were partially
offset by higher average invested cash balances during the period.
 
  Fiscal Year 1993 Compared to Fiscal Year 1992
 
     Revenue rose to $2,005.9 million for fiscal year 1993, increasing 26.5%
over revenue of $1,586.1 million for fiscal year 1992, primarily due to
membership growth and premium rate increases. Approximately 3.9% of the revenue
for fiscal year 1993 was related to the Company's indemnity health and life
insurance and workers' compensation products, compared to 3.2% for the same
period in the previous fiscal year.
 
     Health care costs increased 26.9% to $1,681.1 million for fiscal year 1993
from $1,324.7 million for fiscal year 1992. Health care costs were 83.8% of
total revenue for fiscal year 1993 versus 83.5% of total revenue for the
previous year. Health care costs in fiscal year 1992 were favorably impacted by
a $6.9 million award received in a binding arbitration decision against one of
the Company's insurers. Before adjusting for the $6.9 million insurance
recovery, the Company's cost of health care as a percentage of revenue in fiscal
year 1992 was 84.0%.
 
     During fiscal year 1993, the Company experienced higher physician specialty
costs in California and Utah, as well as higher pharmacy costs in every region
except New Mexico and Guam. The cost of health care, however, improved to 82.6%
as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1993, primarily due
to reductions in hospital costs as well as decreases in health administration
and health care operations costs as a percentage of revenue. These improvements
were partially offset by higher medical services costs due to the inclusion of
medical costs of Great States Insurance Company which was acquired during the
third quarter of fiscal year 1993. Additionally, health care costs continued to
be impacted negatively by less than full absorption of fixed costs incurred in
certain under-utilized California staff model medical centers.
 
     G & A expenses increased 16.3% to $269.6 million from $231.9 million in the
preceding year, due to continuing expansion of the Company's operations. As a
percentage of total revenue, G & A expenses were 13.4% for fiscal year 1993
versus 14.6% of total revenue for the previous year. The reduction of G & A
 
                                       16
<PAGE>   19
 
expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal year 1993 was the result of
spending controls (including hiring constraints) and the achievement of certain
economies of scale. G & A expenses for fiscal year 1992 were unfavorably
impacted by the establishment of a $5.2 million reserve in connection with the
settlement of certain class action stockholder litigation for damages allegedly
sustained as a result of a decline in the Company's stock price in October,
1991. Before the establishment of the reserve for the litigation, G & A expenses
as a percentage of revenue were 14.3% in fiscal year 1992.
 
     Net interest income decreased to $14.7 million in fiscal year 1993 from $22
million in fiscal year 1992, primarily as a result of lower interest rates.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased
by $70 million to $246.8 million at June 30, 1994 from $176.8 million at June
30, 1993. Generally, the Company receives premiums on a monthly prepaid basis.
Major sources of cash during the year ended June 30, 1994, included cash
generated from operations of $102 million and net proceeds from the Notes issued
in September, 1993. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to
repay, in full, certain outstanding indebtedness of approximately $21 million.
The Company used $25 million of the remaining net proceeds to increase the net
surplus of an indirect insurance subsidiary of the Company, with the balance
used in the TakeCare acquisition. Other uses of cash during the period included
$86.1 million for capital expenditures and $55.8 million in transfers to
long-term and restricted investments.
 
     The Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of TakeCare on June 17,
1994 for approximately $1,053 million. In addition, the Company recorded
acquisition related costs of $84.6 million. The acquisition was paid for by the
issuance of approximately 21 million shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"), 6.3 million shares of Common
Stock, cash and Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series B
Preferred Stock"). The Series A Preferred Stock has a stated value of $25 per
share with a dividend rate of 5% per annum. Annual dividend obligations on the
Series A Preferred Stock are estimated to be approximately $26 million. The
Series B Preferred Stock has a stated value of $25 per share with a variable
dividend rate which resets quarterly. Annual dividend obligations on the Series
B Preferred Stock are estimated to be less than $200,000. Dividends are payable
quarterly in arrears.
 
     In order to fund a portion of the cash required for the TakeCare
acquisition, the Company entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the
"Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a $250 million five-year
Term Loan facility (the "Term Loan") and a $100 million five-year Revolving
Credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Loan"). On June 17, 1994, the Company
borrowed $250 million under the Term Loan. The Company also borrowed $50 million
under the Revolving Credit Loan. The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Loan carry
interest rates currently ranging from 5.2% to 5.5% based on the LIBOR rate. The
Term Loan is repayable at the rate of $25 million every six months, commencing
on January 2, 1995. The final payment is due June 17, 1999. The Credit Agreement
contains financial and other covenants, including limitations on indebtedness,
liens, dividends, sale and lease-back transactions and certain other
transactions.
 
     In addition to borrowed funds, the Company used approximately $100 million
of its own funds to substantially complete the transaction. These funds came
from the Company's existing cash balances (including proceeds from the Notes)
and maturing investments held in the Company's investment portfolio.
 
     The Company's ability to make a payment on or repayment of its obligations
under the Notes, the Credit Agreement and dividends on its preferred stock is
dependent in part on the payment of funds to the Company from the Company's
direct and indirect subsidiaries. These subsidiary payments represent: (a) fees
for management services rendered by the Company to the subsidiaries; (b) the
repayment of certain intercompany debt owed by one of the subsidiaries to the
Company; and (c) cash dividends by the subsidiaries to the Company. Nearly all
of the subsidiaries are subject to HMO regulations or insurance regulations and
may be subject to substantial supervision by one or more HMO regulators and
insurance regulators (the "Regulated Subsidiaries"). Each of the Regulated
Subsidiaries must meet or exceed various fiscal standards imposed by HMO
regulations or insurance regulations or by HMO regulators or insurance
regulators, which fiscal
 
                                       17
<PAGE>   20
 
standards may, from time to time, impact the amount of funds paid by one or more
of the Regulated Subsidiaries to the Company as referred to above.
 
     The Company believes the payments referred to above by the subsidiaries
together with other financing sources including the Revolving Credit Loan should
be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its payment obligations under the
Notes, the Credit Agreement and the Company's preferred stock (approximately
$100 million annually). The Company believes that cash flow from operations and
existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund operations and capital
expenditures in fiscal year 1995.
 
  Effects of Regulatory Changes and Inflation
 
     Recently, the Company has been informed by HCFA that effective January 1,
1995, it will receive an annual premium rate increase of approximately 5.0% for
its Senior Plan members. Over calendar years 1993 and 1994, annual Senior Plan
premium increases granted by HCFA were approximately 11.6% and 2.0%,
respectively. Periodically, the Company evaluates the effects of HCFA premium
adjustments on its liquidity and capital resources, and incorporates the actual
and anticipated impact of such adjustments into its planning process.
 
     In recent years, health care costs have been rising at a rate higher than
that for consumer goods as a whole as a result of inflation, new technology and
medical advances. The Company believes, however, that premium rate increases
combined with its cost control measures and financial risk-sharing arrangements
with its contract medical providers help to mitigate the effects of inflation on
its operations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to
reduce the impact of the increasing cost of health care will be as successful in
the future as they have been in the past or that premium rate increases will
equal or exceed increased costs.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Organization
 
     FHP International Corporation (the "Company"), through its direct and
indirect subsidiaries, delivers managed health care services and sells indemnity
medical, group life and workers' compensation insurance.
 
     On June 17, 1994, the Company completed its acquisition of TakeCare, Inc.
("TakeCare") in exchange for cash, common stock and preferred stock. The
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination and
consequently, all balances and results of operations of TakeCare since the date
of acquisition have been included in the accompanying financial statements (see
Note 12 for further description of the acquisition).
 
     Most of the Company's subsidiaries are federally qualified, multi-state
licensed health maintenance organizations ("HMO") which provide comprehensive
health care to their members for a fixed monthly fee per member. In the course
of providing health care services to commercial and governmental employees, the
Company extends credit to various federal government agencies and hospitals,
independent physician groups and to other health care providers and
intermediaries located in California, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Guam, New Mexico,
Illinois, Nevada, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky (and effective October 1, 1994,
Texas).
 
  Principles of Consolidation
 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
 
  Revenue Recognition and Health Care Costs
 
     Premiums from enrolled groups for prepaid health care are recognized in the
month in which the enrollees are entitled to care. Deferred premiums represent
cash received from employer groups in advance of the applicable period of
coverage. Health care costs are recorded in the period when services are
provided to enrolled members, including estimates for contracted medical
specialists and hospital costs which have been incurred as of the balance sheet
date but not yet reported.
 
     Medicare risk contracts with the Health Care Financing Administration
provided 63%, 65% and 65% of revenue in fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.
 
  Excess Purchase Price Over Net Assets Acquired
 
     The excess purchase price over net assets acquired arose primarily from the
purchase of TakeCare. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over
periods not exceeding 40 years.
 
  Cash Equivalents
 
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying value
of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value based on their short-term
maturity.
 
  Short-term, Long-term and Restricted Investments
 
     Short-term, long-term and restricted investments consist of U.S. Treasury
securities, certificates of deposit and other marketable debt securities.
Long-term investments have maturities in excess of one year. Restricted
investments primarily include investments placed on deposit with various state
regulatory agencies to comply with regulatory requirements (Note 6).

  Inventories
 
     Inventories, which consist of prescription drugs, optometry products and
medical supplies, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
 
  Property and Equipment
 
     Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are provided principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the respective classes of assets as follows: buildings, 20 to 40 years;
leasehold improvements, lesser of the useful lives (3 to 10 years) or the lease
term; and equipment and fixtures, 3 to 10 years. Property and equipment also
includes capitalized interest expense of approximately $596,000, $2,597,000 and
$3,600,000 in fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, associated with
the Company's major construction projects.

</TABLE>
 
     The covenants not to compete and preoperating costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis. The covenants not to compete resulted from the Company's
acquisitions of Great States Financial Corporation ("Great States") in March,
1993 and a Colorado HMO in October, 1993 (Note 12). Preoperating costs represent
direct charges incurred in developing HMO operations in new, non-contiguous
geographic service areas prior to the commencement of operations. Amortization
begins on the first date members are eligible to receive services. Total
amortization expense related to other assets was $3,976,000, $1,163,000 and
$142,000 for fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
  Reclassifications
 
     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1994
financial statement presentation.

NOTE 3 -- OTHER LIABILITIES
 
     The Company was self-insured with respect to certain professional liability
claims during calendar years 1975 through 1983. From January, 1984 through
March, 1986, the Company maintained commercial insurance on a claims occurrence
basis with nominal deductibles. Since April 1986, the Company has maintained
commercial insurance on a claims made basis. The Company currently carries
$50,000,000 of professional liability insurance with annual deductibles of
$2,000,000 per occurrence and $12,000,000 in the aggregate.
 
     An estimate of the Company's liability for professional liability claims,
including deductibles, was actuarially computed on a present value basis using a
discount rate of 7%, and amounted to approximately $31,400,000 and $30,300,000
at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Such amounts are allocated between
other current liabilities and other liabilities based on estimates of the
amounts of claims which will be paid during the subsequent fiscal year (Note 8).
 
     Other liabilities also include approximately $40,785,000 and $30,250,000 of
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses at June 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, associated with the Company's insurance operations. These reserves
are estimates based on actuarial computations and industry standards for the
eventual costs of claims incurred but not settled, less reinsurance recoverable
from other companies. As claims are settled, as amounts required to settle
become known and as anticipated claims are actuarially revised, the professional
liability and loss reserve expenses and liabilities are adjusted accordingly.

amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and (b) deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. The effects of
income taxes are measured based on enacted tax law and rates. No

NOTE 7 -- EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
     The Company has a defined contribution pension plan and an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ("ESOP") covering substantially all employees. Under the
provisions of these plans, the Company has contributed or is committed to
contribute into trusts for the benefit of employees an amount equal to 12% of
eligible annual compensation, as defined, of all plan participants. Participants
employed prior to July 1, 1990 become fully vested in their balances over a five
year period. Participants beginning employment on or after July 1, 1990 will not
vest until they have completed five years of service with the Company, at which
time they become 100% vested. Nonvested contributions which are forfeited upon
an employee's termination are treated as a reduction in the amount of the
Company's contribution. The combined contribution expenses for the pension plan
and ESOP were $35,020,000, $32,970,000 and $27,125,000 for fiscal years 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
     Under an Executive Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company is authorized
to grant restricted stock awards, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options and bonus awards to directors, officers, key employees, consultants and
other agents. Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of the stock
options must be equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock at
the date of grant. Stock options are subject to forfeitures due to termination
and other circumstances. Beginning July 1, 1992, the first of a series of four
annual stock option grants for a total of 2,240,000 shares was made to certain
executives under the Plan. These grants are intended to provide a strong linkage
between long-term incentives and the Company's financial performance.
Accelerated vesting of each of these stock options is tied directly to growth in
the Company's earnings per share ("EPS"). Total stock options for 435,000 and
1,085,000 shares were granted under this Plan on July 1, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Each year's stock option grant allows the optionee up to six
consecutive annual opportunities for accelerated vesting of portions of the
employee's stock options only if the Company's EPS exceeds both: (1) EPS for the
previous fiscal year, and (2) average EPS for the two previous fiscal years. The
terms of accelerated vesting for 25% of the stock options granted on July 1,
1992 and 10% of the stock options granted on July 1, 1993 have been met. If a
stock option in the series does not become subject to accelerated vesting by the
sixth anniversary of its grant, the stock option automatically becomes vested on
the seventh anniversary of its grant. The exercise price of the stock option at
each date of grant is equal to the fair market value of the Company's common
stock at the date of grant.
 
     The Company may periodically issue stock options under similar terms and
conditions as those above. The Company granted additional stock options for
982,000 and 407,000 shares during fiscal years 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     Key executives, employees, and directors of TakeCare participated in
TakeCare's stock option programs. The Company established a new stock option
program for the conversion of TakeCare stock options (the "New Plan"). As a
result of the acquisition, TakeCare's stock option programs were terminated and
the rights to participate in these programs were rolled over into the Company's
New Plan. Certain TakeCare stock

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
options were converted to Company stock options at a conversion ratio of 3.2
Company stock options for each TakeCare stock option. The terms (including the
vesting schedule) and the aggregate exercise price of the Company stock options
are the same as the original TakeCare stock options, but the per share exercise
price was adjusted accordingly. The adjusted exercise prices range from $1.16 to
$17.85. Stock options for a total of 964,000 shares were issued by the Company.
These stock options retained their original TakeCare vesting schedule which
provided that stock options became exercisable either at the rate of 25% within
two years after the date of grant and an additional 25% each year thereafter, or
at the rate of 20% within three years after the date of grant of the original
stock options. There were also fully vested TakeCare stock options for 236,000
shares which were exchanged for merger consideration (Note 12) less the
applicable exercise price and required withholding taxes.
 
     The Company granted option rights to purchase approximately 449,000 shares
to former employees of TakeCare on June 17, 1994. These option rights vest in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan described above.
 
     All stock options granted by the Company through June 30, 1994 were
nonqualified. The following is a summary of stock option activity for fiscal
years 1994, 1993 and 1992:

     At June 30, 1994, 1,519,000 shares remained available under the Plan for
future grants of stock awards and stock options. Outstanding stock options at
June 30, 1994, expire at the earlier of the date the stock option holder ceases
to be an employee or a director, or ten years after the date of grant, based on
the date of grant of the original stock options.
 
     The Company has established a deferred compensation plan for certain of its
executives and physicians which is designed to provide supplemental retirement
income benefits by enabling the participants to defer receipt of up to 50% of
their gross annual salaries and 100% of their gross annual bonuses. Deferred
amounts are included in other liabilities and the deferred amounts are deemed to
be invested in one or more mutual funds selected by the participants. The
Company pays premiums on individual life insurance policies whose policy
benefits are equal to the deferred amounts. Account balances, including earnings
from investments, are distributed to a participant upon two years' advance
request or upon a participant's termination of employment, death or disability.
Such distributions are offset by any values in the cash surrender value of the
life insurance policies provided by the Company which are included in other
assets.
 
     On November 1, 1989, 187,000 shares of common stock were issued as
restricted stock awards at a purchase price of $0.02 per share. Compensation
expense was determined based on the excess of the estimated market value of the
stock over the purchase price on the date of the grant and was recognized
ratably over the vesting period which ended on October 31, 1992.

  OPM Audit
 
     The Company contracts with the United States Office of Personnel Management
("OPM") to provide or arrange managed health care services under the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program ("FEHBP") for federal employees, annuitants
and their dependents. OPM is the Company's largest commercial customer. These
contracts with OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium
rating requirements for the FEHBP. OPM conducts periodic audits of its
contractors to, among other things, verify that the premiums established under
the OPM contracts were established in compliance with the community rating and
other requirements under the FEHBP. In May, 1993, after conducting a periodic
audit of the Company covering primarily the years 1988 through 1991, OPM sent a
draft audit report alleging certain defects in the Company's rating practices
under applicable regulatory and contractual requirements, and invited the
Company to comment. Following its evaluation of the additional information and
comments which have been provided by the Company, the OPM auditors will issue a
final report; the OPM Audit Resolution Division will then be responsible for
resolving the audit findings. As part of the resolution process, the Audit
Resolution Division may reconsider the findings of the auditors and the
information provided by the Company.
 
     It is likely that the final audit report will recommend that OPM seek a
monetary recovery from the Company, and that such recommended recovery could be
a substantial amount. At this time, the Company's management and legal counsel
are unable to determine the amounts that may be required to be refunded to OPM
to resolve the audit findings. Management currently believes, however, that
after application of available offsets and consideration of established
reserves, amounts ultimately required to be refunded to OPM will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
In addition, the Company's management does not currently believe that the audit
will have a material effect on future relations with OPM.
 
  Litigation
 
     During the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries
have become a party to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, a
significant number of which involve alleged claims of medical malpractice.
Management of the Company is of the opinion, taking into account its insurance
coverage and

reserves that have been established, that the outcome of the currently known
legal actions and proceedings will not, singly or in the aggregate, have a

subsidiaries.
 
NOTE 9 -- NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
 
     During fiscal years 1993 and 1992, the ESOP repaid the Company amounts
previously loaned of $4,150,000 and $8,548,000, respectively. The loans were
made to enable the ESOP to purchase the Company's common stock on a periodic
basis and were repaid from periodic contributions to the ESOP received from the
Company (Note 7).
 
     The Company currently makes quarterly contributions (pursuant to the annual
contribution described in Note 7) to the ESOP to fund quarterly purchases by the
ESOP on the open market. For fiscal years 1994 and 1993, the Company contributed
$9,140,000 and $6,870,000, respectively, for this purpose.
 
NOTE 10 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
     In June, 1994, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to
increase the authorized number of shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to
100,000,000 and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock from
5,000,000 to 40,000,000. As the Company issues preferred stock, it is designated
as either Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred
Stock") or Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series B
Preferred Stock"). The Company issued 6,311,781 shares of common stock,
21,031,733 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 32,850 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock as merger consideration in the acquisition of TakeCare (Note
12).
 
     Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative
cash dividends of 5.0% per annum. Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears
when and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors. On or after the fourth
anniversary of the acquisition, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or
part of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at fixed redemption
prices per share plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock may be convertible at the option of the holder
into the Company's common stock at any time commencing six months after the
acquisition date. The conversion price for the Series A Preferred Stock is $31
per share.
 
     Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash
dividends of not less than 5.0% per annum or greater than 11.0% per annum. The
actual dividend rate will be determined quarterly based upon prevailing market
interest rates. The dividend established as of June 17, 1994, was 6.86%.
Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears when and if declared by the
Company's Board of Directors. Beginning nine months after June 17, 1994, the
Company may, at its option, redeem all or part of the outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, at $25 per share plus an amount equal to accrued and
unpaid dividends.
 
     In June, 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of
one common share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common
stock to the holders of record on June 29, 1990 and authorized and directed the
issuance of one Right with respect to each share of common stock that shall
become outstanding prior to the occurrence of certain terminating events. Each
Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one-fourth of
a share of common stock at a price which varies based on the market price of a
share of the Company's stock ($24.00 at June 30, 1994), subject to adjustment
(the "Purchase Price"). Upon the occurrence of certain events associated with an
unsolicited takeover attempt of the Company, the Rights will become exercisable
and will cease to automatically trade with the common stock. Thereafter, upon
the occurrence of certain further triggering events, each Right will become
exercisable, at an adjusted Purchase Price (the "Adjusted Purchase Price") equal
to four times the Purchase Price immediately prior to such adjustment, for that
number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times such
Adjusted Purchase Price. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects that will
cause

substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company
in a manner which causes the Rights to become exercisable. The terms of the
Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company without the
consent of the holders of the Rights. At June 30, 1994, there was one Right
outstanding for each share of common stock outstanding and a sufficient number
of authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance upon
(i) the exercise of the Rights, (ii) the issuance of common stock (and
associated Rights) in connection with the future exercise of outstanding stock
options, and (iii) the issuance of common stock (and associated Rights) in
connection with the future conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.
 
NOTE 11 -- EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCK
 
     Earnings per share for fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 were computed by
dividing net income attributable to common stock by 34,051,000, 33,270,000 and
32,921,000 shares, respectively, which represent the weighted average number of
outstanding common shares and common share equivalents during the respective
periods. Common share equivalents include the effect of dilutive stock options
calculated using the treasury stock method.
 
NOTE 12 -- ACQUISITIONS
 
     The Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of TakeCare on
June 17, 1994. The acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting
purposes, assuming all common shares were tendered as of the acquisition date.
The consolidated financial statements include the operations of TakeCare
beginning June 17, 1994. The purchase price was approximately $1,053 million and
was financed through the issuance of 6,311,781 shares of common stock,
21,031,733 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 32,850 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, a term loan facility of $250 million with a consortium of
banks, a revolving loan facility of $100 million (of which $50 million was
utilized) and internally generated funds of approximately $100 million to
substantially complete the transaction, including non-shareholder related costs.
These costs included the repayment of TakeCare's outstanding long-term debt of
$24.3 million and other costs of $60.3 million related to the transaction.
 
     The acquisition provided for the conversion of each share of TakeCare
common stock into the right to receive, without interest, .48 of a share of the
Company's common stock, 1.6 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and either 1.096
shares of Series B Preferred Stock or, at the election of the holder of such
share, cash equal to $27.40 per share of TakeCare common stock. As of September
2, 1994, 457,531 shares of TakeCare common stock had not been presented for
redemption. Consequently, additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be
issued after June 30, 1994, at the election of these shareholders. These
consolidated financial statements assume that untendered shares will not elect
Series B Preferred Stock.
 
     The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma consolidated results
of operations of the Company as though the acquisition of TakeCare had occurred
on July 1, 1992. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations
shown below do not necessarily represent what the consolidated results of
operations of the Company would have been if the acquisition had actually
occurred on July 1, 1992, nor do they represent a forecast of the consolidated
results of operations of the Company for any future period.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
     In March, 1993, the Company acquired Great States and its subsidiaries for
approximately $21.7 million, net of cash acquired. Through its subsidiaries,
Great States writes workers' compensation insurance policies in California and
Arizona and provides various claims administration services. The acquisition,
which has been accounted for as a purchase, was financed through cash generated
from operations of the Company. As a result of the purchase, the Company
recorded costs in excess of net assets acquired of approximately $2.5 million.
The Company also obtained a covenant not to compete for which it paid $4 million
(Note 1).
 
     In October, 1993, the Company acquired an approximately 4,700 member HMO
located in Denver, Colorado for approximately $3.5 million. The acquisition,
which has been accounted for as a purchase, was financed through cash generated
from operations of the Company. As a result of the purchase, the Company
recorded costs in excess of net assets acquired of approximately $1 million. The
Company also obtained a covenant not to compete for which it paid $0.5 million
(Note 1).
 
NOTE 13 -- INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
 
     The Company offers a full range of products to achieve its strategic goal
of becoming a sole source provider of health care services. These products can
be classified into two principal segments of business: HMO and insurance
services. The HMO offers a full range of related products to consumers and
employers in the direct delivery of managed health care services. Complementing
the operations of the HMO are the products offered by the insurance segment.
These products include traditional indemnity health and life insurance, workers'
compensation and third party administration of self-insured employer programs.
Often, the products offered by the HMO and insurance segments are sold to the
same account; that is, an employer is able to offer a "dual choice" to employees
of enrollment in either the HMO or the indemnity coverage provided through group
health insurance coverage.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
FHP International Corporation:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FHP
International Corporation and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedules listed in the index at Item
14(a). These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of FHP International Corporation and
its subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                             A DELAWARE CORPORATION

                        ________________________________


                                   ARTICLE I

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS


         1.      Annual Meetings.  An annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other
business as may come before the meeting shall be held on the third Thursday in
November of each calendar year, or on such other date as may be fixed by the
Board of Directors, at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors.

         2.      Special Meetings.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any
series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock of the Corporation as
to dividends or upon liquidation ("Preferred Stock") with respect to such
series of Preferred Stock, a special meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation for any purpose may be called at any time as follows:

                 A.       By the Chairman of the Board; or

                 B.       By resolution adopted by a majority of the total
number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies
(the "Whole Board").

         3.      Place of Meeting.  The Board of Directors may designate the
place of meeting, within or without the State of Delaware, for any annual
meeting or for any 



<PAGE>   4
special meeting of the stockholders called by the 
Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board.  If no designation is so 
made, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation.

         4.      Calling and Notice of Meetings.  Not less than 10 or more than
60 days before the date on which any meeting of the stockholders is to be held,
written notice of the meeting shall be provided to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting.  This notice shall be provided by mailing it,
postage prepaid, to the address furnished by each stockholder to the Secretary
for that purpose, or if he has not done so, then to his address as it appears
on the records of the Corporation.  This notice may also be provided by telex,
telegraph, cable or personal delivery.  This notice must state the place, date
and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose for
which the meeting is called.  Only such business shall be conducted at a
special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting
pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.  Meetings may be held without
notice if all stockholders entitled to vote are present, or if notice is waived
by those not present in accordance with Article VI, Section 1 of these Bylaws.
Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed, and
(unless the Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provides) any special
meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the Board of
Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for
such meeting of stockholders.

         5.      Quorum.  Except as otherwise required by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of stock constituting a
majority of the voting power of the Corporation, present in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum, except that when specified business is to be voted
on by a class or series of stock voting as a class, the holders of a majority
of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum of such class
or series for the transaction of such business.





                                      -2-
<PAGE>   5
         6.      Loss of Quorum.  In the event of withdrawal from a meeting of
enough stockholders such that less than a quorum remains, business may continue
to be transacted so long as any action taken is approved by at least a majority
of votes required to constitute a quorum.

         7.      Adjournments.  The Chairman of any stockholders' meeting or
the holders of shares of stock constituting a majority of the voting power
present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
whether or not there is a quorum present.  No notice of the time and place of
adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law.  At any such
resumed stockholders' meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be
transacted which otherwise might have been transacted at the original meeting.

         8.      Conduct of Meeting.  Every meeting of stockholders shall be
chaired by the Chairman of the Board or, in his absence, the President or, in
his absence, any other officer or director of the Corporation chosen as meeting
chairman by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person
or by proxy and entitled to vote.

         9.      List of Stockholders.  The Secretary, or other officer or
Director who has charge of the Corporation's stock ledger, shall prepare or
cause to be prepared, at least 10 days before each meeting of the stockholders
at which Directors of the Corporation are to be elected, a list of all
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, showing alphabetically, the name
and address of, and number of shares registered to, each stockholder.  This
list shall be present during the meeting and shall be available to all
stockholders throughout this 10-day period at or within reasonable distance
from the place where the meetings to be held.  This list shall be conclusive
evidence of the stockholders of record and entitled to examine it or the books
of the Corporation, or to vote at meetings.

         10.     Record Date.  The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date
as the record date for determining the following:

                 A.       The stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
any meeting, or to vote on any corporate action;

                 B.       The stockholders entitled to receive dividends or
distributions;

                 C.       The stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock; or

                 D.       The stockholders entitled to participate in any other
lawful transaction.

         11.     Voting.  At each meeting of stockholders, each stockholder of
record as of the record date shall be entitled to one vote for each share of
voting stock of the Corporation registered in his name on the books of the
Corporation.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock to elect Directors under specified circumstances, Directors shall be
elected by the greatest number of the affirmative votes cast.  Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws,
all other matters shall be decided by the majority of votes cast.  Neither the
election of Directors nor any other action need be by ballot.

         12.     Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations.

                 A.       Annual Meetings of Stockholders.  (1) Nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the
proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an
annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of
meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any
stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder





                                      -4-
<PAGE>   7
of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Bylaw, who is
entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set
forth in this Bylaw.

                          (2)  For nominations or other business to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of
paragraph (A)(1) of this Bylaw, the stockholder must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and such other business
must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action.  To be timely, a
stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on
the 60th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to
the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided,
however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30
days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or
the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made by the Corporation.  In no event shall the public
announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period
for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.  Such
stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder
proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director all information
relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of
proxies for election of Directors in an election contest, or is otherwise
required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 14a-11 thereunder
(including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement
as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); (b) as to any other
business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the
reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any





                                      -5-
<PAGE>   8
material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the
stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf
the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such
stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial
owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are
owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.

                          (3)  Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence
of paragraph (A)(2) of this Bylaw to the contrary, in the event that the number
of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is
increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of
the nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board of
Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Bylaw shall also
be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is
first made by the Corporation.

                 B.       Special Meetings of Stockholders.  Only such business
shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a
special meeting of stockholders at which Directors are to be elected pursuant
to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that
Directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the
Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice
provided for in this Bylaw, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and
who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Bylaw.  In the event
the





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   9
Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing
one or more Directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may
nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such
position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the
stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Bylaw shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to
such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on
which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and
of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such
meeting.  In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a
special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's
notice as described above.

                 C.       General.  (1)  Only such persons who are nominated in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bylaw shall be eligible to
serve as Directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Bylaw. Except as otherwise provided by law,
the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether
a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made
or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Bylaw and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance
with this Bylaw, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be
disregarded.

                          (2)  For purposes of this Bylaw, "public
announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow
Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in
a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.





                                      -7-
<PAGE>   10
                          (3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Bylaw, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Bylaw.  Nothing in this Bylaw shall be deemed to
affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or
(ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors under
specified circumstances.

         13.     Inspectors; Opening and Closing the Polls.  The Chairman of
the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of an election of directors.
The inspectors, who need not be stockholders, but who may serve the Corporation
in other capacities, shall decide the qualification of voters and the validity
of ballots, count votes and declare results.  Each inspector, before
discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability.

         The Chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the
date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon
which the stockholders will vote at a meeting.

         14.     Proxies.  Every stockholder may authorize in writing another
person, who need not be a stockholder, to take any action and exercise any
right held by the stockholder.  Every such proxy must be signed by the
stockholder or his attorney in fact, and shall, unless stated otherwise, be
valid for a period of 3 years.

         15.     Record Date for Action by Written Consent.  In order that the
Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date
shall not be more than 10





                                      -8-
<PAGE>   11
days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors.  Any stockholder of record seeking to have the
stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by
written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record
date.  The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days
after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing
the record date.  If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal
place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date has
been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors
is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.

         16.     Inspectors of Written Consent.  In the event of the delivery,
in the manner provided by Article I, Section 15, to the Corporation of the
requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any
related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage nationally
recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly
performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and
revocations.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such
review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until
such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the
consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with





                                      -9-
<PAGE>   12
Article I, Section 15 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to take the corporate action.  Nothing contained in this paragraph
shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors
or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent
or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the
independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without
limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with
respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).

         17.     Effectiveness of Written Consent.  Every written consent shall
bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no
written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless, within 60 days of the date the earliest dated written consent
was received in accordance with Article I, Section 15, a written consent or
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are
delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in Article I, Section 15.

                                   ARTICLE II
                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         1.      General Powers.  The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.  The Board of
Directors shall have such authority and powers of the Corporation to do all
such lawful acts as are not required to be done by the stockholders.

         2.      Number and Term Of Office.  The Board of Directors shall
consist of not less than seven or more than eleven members.  The initial number
of Directors shall be seven.  Thereafter, the number of Directors shall be
fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Directors need not be
stockholders of the Corporation.  Commencing with the annual meeting of
stockholders to be held in 1986, the Board





                                      -10-
<PAGE>   13
of Directors shall be classified, with respect to the time for which the
Directors severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number
as possible, as determined by the Board of Directors, such that approximately
one-third of the members of the Board shall be elected at each annual meeting
of stockholders.  One class, to be comprised of approximately one-third of the
Directors, as designated by the Board of Directors, shall hold office until the
annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1987; a second class, to be
comprised of approximately one-third of the Directors, as designated by the
Board of Directors, shall hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders
to be held in 1988; and a third class, to be comprised of approximately
one-third of the Directors, as designed at the Board of Directors, shall hold

                                GENERAL MATTERS

         1.      Waiver of Notice.  Whenever any notice is required to be given
the person entitled to such notice or his attorney in fact may waive such
notice in writing before or after the matter in respect of which notice is
required has occurred.  Any waiver need not specify the matter for which notice
is waived.  Presence in person or by proxy at any portion of a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, unless such presence is for the
purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business thereat.

         2.      Indemnification.  Indemnification by the Corporation of any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative ("proceeding"), by reason of the fact
that such person is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent ("agent") of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an
agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise ("other entity"), against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and other amounts actually and
reasonably incurred by such persons (including advancement of expenses incurred
in defending any such-proceeding), shall, to the full extent permitted by, and
in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in, applicable law
(i) be mandatory if such agent is or was a Director or officer of the
Corporation or of such other entity and (ii) be authorized, subject to the
discretion of the Board of Directors, if such person is or was an employee or
other agent (not a Director or officer) of the Corporation or such other
entity; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to
indemnify any person with respect to any proceeding which was initiated by such
person.

         3.      Records.  The Secretary shall keep written minutes of the
proceedings of the stockholders, Board of Directors and committees of the
Corporation at the principal executive office of the Corporation.  These
records shall be open to inspection and copying during ordinary business hours
by any Director.  This right of inspection shall also be enjoyed by all
stockholders so long as it is exercised for a purpose reasonably related to the
person's interest as a stockholder.

         4.      Reports.  The Board of Directors may employ accountants and
auditors to prepare such statements and reports which are required by
applicable law or which the Board desires.

         5.      Right of Inspection.  Any stockholder shall have the right to
inspect the books and records of the Corporation during normal business hours
for any purpose reasonably related to that person's status as a stockholder.

         6.      Conformity with Law.

                 A.       In General.  In the event that any portion of these
Bylaws is found not to be in conformance with applicable law, such portion
shall, if possible, be deemed modified to conform retrospectively and
prospectively with applicable law.  If any portion of these Bylaws is found
fatally inconsistent with applicable law, then the remainder of these Bylaws
shall continue in full force and effect.

                 B.       Conformity With Applicable California Law.  In the
event the Corporation is advised by its counsel that it is subject to the
provisions of California Corporations Code Section 2115, then these Bylaws
shall be deemed amended to include, and the Corporation shall follow the
requirements of those applicable provisions of the Code set forth in said
Section.  In the event the Corporation is so advised and inasmuch, as and for
as long as, there are fewer than 100 shareholders,





                                      -19-
<PAGE>   22
the requirement of an annual report to shareholders referred to in Section 1501
of the California Corporations Code is expressly waived.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Trustees and Participants of the FHP International
Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan:


We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the FHP International
Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan) listed in the accompanying
index.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the FHP International
Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental information by fund in
the statements of net assets available for benefits and statements of changes
in net assets available for benefits is presented for the purpose of additional
analysis of the basic financial statements rather than to present information
regarding the net assets available for benefits and changes in net assets
available for benefits of the individual funds, and is not a required part of
the basic financial statements.  Also, the supplemental schedules listed in the
accompanying index are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and are
not a required part of the basic financial statements, but are supplementary
information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for
Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974.  The supplemental information by fund and supplemental schedules are the
responsibility of the Plan's management.  The supplemental information by fund
and supplemental schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
are fairly stated in all material respects when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

FHP INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY
            OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The FHP International Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan)
     was adopted on June 6, 1986 by FHP International Corporation and its
     wholly owned subsidiary, FHP, Inc. (collectively, the Company).  The Plan
     was amended and restated in its entirety June 7, 1993, effective January
     1, 1993.

     The accompanying financial statements of the Plan are prepared on the
     accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted
     accounting principles.  Investments in common stock of the Company are
     stated at fair value based on the closing bid price reported on the last
     business day of the Plan year.  Investments in mutual funds are stated at
     the fair value of the respective funds on the last business day of the
     Plan year.  Investments in pooled funds, which consist of money market
     funds, are stated at cost which approximates fair value.  Cost of
     investments is determined by the average cost method.  Security
     transactions are recorded as of the trade dates.

     Realized gains and losses on security transactions are recorded based on
     the difference between proceeds received and weighted average cost.  In
     accordance with the policy of stating investments at fair value, the
     increase or decrease in net unrealized appreciation is included with
     realized gains and losses in net appreciation (depreciation) in fair value
     of investments in the accompanying statements of changes in net assets
     available for benefits.

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1993 financial statements
     in order to conform to the 1994 presentation.

NOTE 2 - PLAN DESCRIPTION AND RELATED INFORMATION

     The following description of the Plan provides only general information.
     Participants should refer to the Plan document for a more complete
     description of the Plan's provisions.

FHP INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


     As amended and restated, the Plan is intended to qualify under Internal
     Revenue Code (Code) Section 401(a).  It consists of three separate, but
     complementary parts designed to satisfy the specific rules in the code
     applicable to each part.  The first part is an employee stock ownership
     plan (ESOP) intended to qualify under Code Section 4975(e)(7), the second
     part is a 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under
     Code Section 401(k), and the third part is a payroll based tax credit
     employee stock ownership plan (PAYSOP) intended to qualify under Code
     Sections 41 and 409.  The Plan is subject to the provisions of the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

     The Plan covers substantially all employees of the Company who were
     employed prior to January 1, 1993 and who have completed at least six
     months and 1,000 hours of service with the Company and have attained the
     age of 21.  Under the amended Plan (Note 1), employees hired on or after
     January 1, 1993 become participants on the first day of the month
     immediately following the later of the date they attain age 21, or the
     date they complete 12 months of service with the Company.  Prior to
     January 1, 1993, participants were eligible to enroll on January 1 and
     July 1.  Under the amended plan, enrollment may occur monthly.  At June
     30, 1994 and 1993, there were approximately 10,000 and 9,700 participants
     in the Plan, respectively.

     Plan Administration

     The Plan is administered by the Company.  Assets of the Plan are
     maintained under the custody of the Plan's independent trustee, Wells
     Fargo Bank, N.A. (Trustee).  Under the terms of the Plan, certain costs of
     the Plan's administration can be charged to the Plan.  Administrative and
     Trustee fees in the amount of $461,096 and $433,177 were charged to the
     Plan for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Participant Accounts

     Separate accounts are maintained for each participant's ESOP, PAYSOP and
     401(k) investments.  These accounts have been credited with employee
     pre-tax contributions for 401(k) accounts only, Company contributions and
     allocable portions of Plan earnings or losses.  Participating employees
     are not subject to state or Federal income taxes on contributions and
     related earnings until such amounts are distributed.

     Contributions

     During the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, the Company contributed
     $12,324,769 and $11,533,467, respectively, to the Plan, an amount equal to
     4% of participating employees' eligible compensation, net of forfeitures
     and refunds required by IRS limitation testing, plus interest-related
     contributions and the Company's matching contribution as described below.
     All participant contributions were remitted to the Plan by June 30, 1994
     and 1993.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


     Non-highly compensated employees (as defined in the Code) may participate
     in the 401(k) program and may make pre-tax contributions not to exceed 10%
     of their eligible annual compensation.  Highly compensated participants
     can make pre-tax contributions not to exceed 5% of their eligible annual
     compensation.  Contributions are limited to the maximum amount allowed
     under the Code ($9,240 and $8,994 per employee in calendar year 1994 and
     1993, respectively).

     The 401(k) provides an investment option which permits investment in the
     Company's common stock (FHP Stock Fund).  The Company has committed to
     make an annual matching ESOP contribution equal to $0.25 for each $1.00
     contributed by participants to the FHP Stock Fund (only participant
     contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation are matched).  Matching
     ESOP contributions are subject to an annual limit of $500 per participant
     and are only contributed for participants who are employed by the Company
     on June 30th of each year.  The matching ESOP contribution, net of
     forfeitures, totaled $1,042,652 and $878,509  for the years ended June 30,
     1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Contributions under the PAYSOP are limited to the maximum credit available
     to the Company for Federal income tax purposes.  Due to changes in the tax
     law pursuant to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the credit was not available
     to the Company for any period after December 31, 1986 and, therefore, no
     PAYSOP contributions have been made by the Company after the year ended
     June 30, 1987.

     Vesting

     Participants are fully vested in their PAYSOP and 401(k) contributions and
     related earnings at all times.  Participants employed prior to July 1,
     1990, become fully vested in their ESOP accounts after five years of
     service.  This is accomplished through 10% increments for each of the
     first four years of employment with the Company, with 100% vesting at the
     end of the fifth year of service.  Participants beginning employment on or
     after July 1, 1990 will not vest in the Company's contributions to, and
     the related earnings of, their ESOP accounts until they have completed
     five years of employment with the Company, at which time they become 100%
     vested in their accounts.

     Participants also become fully vested if they achieve age 65, die or
     become totally and permanently disabled while employed by the Company.

     Loans

     Under certain conditions, participants may borrow up to the lesser of
     $50,000 or one-half of their 401(k) balances (not to exceed $50,000 total
     borrowing when combined with loans under the FHP Money Purchase Pension
     Plan).  Repayment is generally required within five to fifteen years, and
     all loans bear interest at a rate equal to Bank of America's prime lending
     rate plus 2% on the last business day of the month prior to the month the
     loan application is received.  During the years ended June 30, 1994 and
     1993, the Plan loaned to participants $567,739 and $469,580 respectively,
     and loan repayments were $233,481 and $154,638, respectively.

     Withdrawals and Distributions

     Participants may withdraw all or part of their 401(k) account balances
     when they reach age of 59 1/2 or before age 59 1/2 if they meet certain
     financial hardship conditions.  Participants may not withdraw their ESOP
     and PAYSOP account balances while they remain employed with the Company.

     Upon termination of employment, death or disability, the vested portions
     of a participant's accounts are distributed to the participant or
     beneficiary.  Distributions may be made in cash or shares of the Company's
     common stock (if applicable), and may be made immediately or when the
     participant reaches age 65.  If a participant terminates employment prior
     to age 65 for reasons other than death or disability, the nonvested
     portion of the account balances will be forfeited.  Forfeited amounts are
     used to reduce Company contributions.  The total amounts forfeited were
     $1,326,798 and $854,717 for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993,
     respectively.

     At June 30, 1994 and 1993, the amounts of benefits payables to
     participants who have withdrawn from participation in the Plan were
     $2,038,331 and $1,812,263, respectively (see Note 1).  Those amounts are
     reflected on Form 5500's for 1994 and 1993 as benefit claims payable.
     Such amounts are not considered liabilities for financial reporting
     purposes and, accordingly, the balances are not included in the $9,035,256
     and $4,748,459 benefits, terminations and withdrawals for the years ended
     June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Plan Termination

     Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
     right under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to
     terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.  In the event of
     Plan termination, participants will become 100% vested in all accounts and
     the account balances will be distributed.

     Tax Status of The Plan

     The Plan obtained its latest determination letter on March 10, 1994, in
     which the Internal Revenue Service stated that the Plan, as then designed,
     was in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Code.


NOTE 3 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On September 9, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an
     amendment to the Plan.  The principal amendment results in a change of the
     Plan year from the current fiscal year to a calendar year.  The amendment
     is effective January 1, 1995.

     The Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of TakeCare, Inc. on
     June 17, 1994.  The acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting
     purposes.  In connection with the acquisition, the amendment, as noted,
     allows former TakeCare employees to be eligible to participate in the Plan
     effective January 1, 1995.
