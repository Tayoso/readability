                                  PART I


Item 1.  Business.
         --------

  NCH Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries
(herein collectively referred to as the "Company" or "NCH" unless the
context requires differently) markets an extensive line of
maintenance, repair and supply products to customers throughout the
world.  Products include specialty chemicals, fasteners, welding
supplies, plumbing and electronic parts, and safety supplies.  These
products are marketed principally through the Company's own sales
force.  There have been no significant changes in the kind of products
produced or marketed by the Company since the beginning of the last
fiscal year, although individual products are continually added to and
deleted from the product line.  Sales are generally consistent
throughout the year, with no significant seasonal fluctuations.

  Competitive conditions in the industry involved are severe and the
Company believes that no one enterprise or group of enterprises has a
dominant or preeminent position in the market.  Further, the Company
believes that no enterprise has a significant percentage of the
market.  No informative statement can be made as to the Company's rank
in its industry.  Not only do other concerns compete in the broad
general range of maintenance, repair or supply products, but there are
also many competitors who produce one or more products which compete
with specific products sold by the Company.  Competition in the
industry is primarily on the basis of price, service and product
performance.  The Company's main emphasis is on service and product
performance rather than price.  Sales of Company products are not
dependent upon a limited number of customers, and no particular
customer accounts for as much as 1/2% of sales.

  Qualified sales representatives are crucial to the Company's
operations.  In addition to industry competition, the Company competes
with the entire business community for qualified sales
representatives.  This competition has been, and remains, severe.  The
Company has a required formal training program for its sales
representatives consisting of in-house and field training.  Turnover
of new sales representatives in the first year is estimated to be
approximately 83%, based on the Company's experience in the last three
years.  The cost of recruiting and training sales representatives was
approximately $47.5 million, $46.2 million and $44.9 million for the
years ended April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  The products that the Company markets are readily available from
numerous sources.  The Company buys raw materials and finished
products from a large number of suppliers, none of whom would
materially impact the sales or earnings of the Company should they
cease to be a source of supply.  In some foreign countries, licensees
manufacture specialty chemical products for marketing by the Company's
subsidiaries.

  Patents, franchises and concessions have not played an important
role in the Company's business.  Trademarks are extensively used on
products, and are useful but not of paramount importance.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

  As of the end of its last fiscal year the Company employed 10,378
persons.  The Company employs 74 professional or technical persons on
its laboratory staff ranging from Ph.D's to nongraduate chemical
technicians.  Although the laboratory staff spends time on research
activities relating to the development of new products or services and
the improvement of existing products or services, the staff is also
engaged in quality control and customer service activities.  Costs
cannot be broken down between these various activities.  The
approximate amounts spent on laboratory operations in the years ended
April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, were $4.4 million, $3.9 million and
$3.4 million, respectively.  All laboratory costs, including research
and development, are expensed as incurred.

  The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and
regulations affecting businesses in general, including environmental
laws and regulations.  Complying with all laws and regulations has not
materially affected the Company's competitive position, earnings or
capital expenditures.  All laws and regulations are subject to change
and the Company cannot predict what effect, if any, changes might have
on its business.

  International sales are conducted through subsidiaries in Europe,
Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Far East.  Intercompany sales
and profits have been eliminated from the following schedule. 
Corporate expenses are allocated between the geographic areas. 
Identifiable assets are those identified with the operations in each
geographic area.  Corporate assets includes portions of cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities.

  Financial information by geographic area, in thousands of dollars,
follows for the years ended April 30:

  Sales between geographic areas and export sales from the United
States are immaterial and are therefore not included in net sales
disclosed in the above table.

  In the Company's experience, other than currency fluctuations, the
overall risk of international operations has not been appreciably
higher than domestic operations, although the risk of operations in any
one country may be greater than in the United States.  The Company is
subject to the risks inherent in operating in foreign countries,
including government regulation, currency restrictions and other
restraints, risk of expropriation and burdensome taxes.


Item 2.  Properties.
         ----------

  The Company owns its world headquarters and domestic administrative
center complex in Irving, Texas, containing approximately 319,000
square feet.

  The Company owns and operates 19 manufacturing facilities in 7
states and 10 foreign countries, located in Canada, Europe, Latin
America and the Far East, containing approximately 1,160,000 square
feet.  These facilities also include related office and warehouse
space.

  The Company owns and occupies a total of 15 office or
office/warehouse combinations in 5 states and 4 foreign countries,
located in Europe and Latin America, containing approximately 710,000
square feet.

  In addition, the Company leases additional warehouse space,
manufacturing plants, and office space at various locations in the
United States and abroad, none of which is material in relation to the
Company's overall assets.

  During the last fiscal year the Company made investments, net of
dispositions, of $13,124,000 ($14,219,000 gross) in capital property,
plant and equipment.

  The plants and properties owned and operated by the Company are
maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and
adequate for the next several years.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
         -----------------

  There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is
subject.

  From time to time, the Company is named as a potentially responsible
party in proceedings involving compliance with environmental laws and
regulations.  Management of the Company believes that an administrative
proceeding currently pending involving
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the Company's solvent recycling program will not have a material effect
on the Company's financial condition or results of operations and will
not result in monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000, if any.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
         ---------------------------------------------------

  No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended April 30, 1994, as contained in the 1994
Report to the Shareholders.  These consolidated financial statements
and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 1994.  In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial

the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present

                               April 28, 1994


  At a meeting held on April 28, 1994, the Compensation Committee considered the
proposal of Towers Perrin & Co. to adopt an incentive bonus plan for members of
the Executive Committee for fiscal year 1995.

  Subject to stockholder approval, the Compensation Committee unanimously
adopted the following plan for the payment of bonuses to each member of the
Executive Committee (being Lester A. Levy, Milton P. Levy, Jr., and
Irvin L. Levy) based on the increase of net income of NCH Corporation, if any,
calculated before the calculation of any bonus pursuant to this plan, but after
taxes.

    Percentage Increase In              Dollar Amount
    Net Income Before Bonus                of Bonus    
    -----------------------            ----------------

    Less than 10%                              -0-
    10% - less than 14%                  $ 225,000 each
    14% - less than 16%                  $ 300,000 each
    16% or more                          $ 375,000 each


 The bonus plan may not be amended to increase the cost of the plan to NCH or
change the persons to whom bonuses will be paid without a vote of NCH's
stockholders.  The Compensation Committee will be authorized to make other
amendments to the bonus plan.

 The Compensation Committee members, being all of the independent directors
without a conflict of interest, authorize this proposal to be presented to the
stockholders for approval at the annual meeting of NCH Corporation to be held
the last Thursday in July, 1994.  Each member of the Compensation Committee and
director, by his signature hereto, waives all formalities in connection with
this meeting and adopts the matter set forth in these minutes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
- - ------------ ---------- --- -------- -- --------- --------- ---
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- - ------- -- ----------

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- - --------- --- ------- ---------

        In the fiscal year ended April 30, 1994, working capital increased
to $262.4 million from $253.3 million at April 30, 1993.  The current
ratio was 3.6 to 1 at April 30, 1994, compared to 3.7 to 1 at April 30,
1993.  The total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
increased by $1.0 million to $124.5 million at April 30, 1994.  Net
cash flow from operations totaled $30.8 million.  Principal uses of
cash consisted of net capital expenditures of $13.1 million, the
repurchase of 55,900 shares of the Company's stock for $3.4 million and
payment of dividends of $16.5 million.  Additional funds were provided
by the borrowing of cash surrender values of company-owned life
insurance policies on key employees of $7.8 million and net additional
borrowings of $4.7 million.  During the year ended April 30, 1994, the
Company purchased the assets of two small businesses amounting to $3.7
million.  Management expects that operating cash flows will continue to
generate sufficient funds to finance operating needs, capital
expenditures and the payment of dividends.  Long-term and short-term
indebtedness has usually been limited to the borrowing of local country
currencies by the Company's international subsidiaries to finance
working capital requirements, although the Company has incurred debt
domestically at various times when financially advantageous.    

        The Company's international subsidiaries operate on a fiscal year
ending on the last day of February.  At February 28, 1994, the value of
the U.S. dollar had increased relative to most of the currencies in
which the Company's international subsidiaries operate.  As a result,
the reported values of both assets and liabilities of the Company's
international subsidiaries decreased as a result of the change in the
Company's composite spot rate at February 28, 1994, compared to
February 28, 1993.  This is reflected by the foreign currency
translation component of stockholders' equity, which changed from a
$17.0 million reduction of equity at April 30, 1993, to a $22.1 million
reduction of equity at April 30, 1994. 

        Accounts receivable increased by $3.2 million and inventories
increased by $11.4 million in the year ended April 30, 1994, as
measured in U.S. dollars and reported on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  These changes include the addition of $.9 million of accounts
receivable and $.7 million of inventories acquired in the purchase of
the assets of two small businesses, as well as the effect of exchange
rate changes during the year.  As stated above, the result of the
exchange rate deviations from the end of the prior year to the end of
fiscal 1994 was to decrease the reported U.S. dollar values of both
assets and liabilities.  The change in accounts receivable and
inventories presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is
exclusive of the effect of exchange rates on the reported asset values
and shows that accounts receivable increased by $6.0 million compared
to the end of the prior year, while inventories
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

increased by $11.6 million in the same period.  These amounts exclude
the accounts receivable and inventories acquired in the purchase of the
assets of two small businesses, which is shown separately in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an investing activity.  The
increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher
sales in the domestic operations during the fourth quarter of the
current year compared to the previous year.  Inventories increased
primarily as a result of higher inventories in the domestic operations,
where increased sales levels in the current year have resulted in
higher inventory requirements. 

        Accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes payable were
similarly affected by currency translation.  These liabilities
increased by $3.3 million when measured exclusive of the effect of
exchange rate changes but increased by $2.8 million as reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Accounts payable and accrued expenses
increased primarily in the Company's domestic operations as a result of
increased domestic sales and increased inventory levels in the current
year as compared to the prior year.  Income taxes payable were
relatively even, exclusive of the effect of exchange rate changes.

        Net capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,
excluding net assets acquired in the purchase of businesses, were $13.1
million for the year ended April 30, 1994.  These consisted of normal
expenditures for data processing and operating equipment, and
completion of a manufacturing facility in the U.S.  Property, plant and
equipment acquired in the purchase of the assets of two small
businesses amounted to $.9 million.  As with the other assets and
liabilities, the effect of currency translation on the reported U.S.
dollar values of property, plant and equipment was to decrease those
reported values.  Capital expenditures for the upcoming year are
anticipated to be approximately the same as prior year expenditures.

        Total bank indebtedness, comprised of long-term debt, current
maturities of long-term debt and notes payable, increased exclusive of
the effect of exchange rate changes by $4.7 million, while the
Consolidated Balance Sheets show an increase of $4.3 million.  During
the year, additional short-term borrowings were made, primarily in
Europe, offset by the annual debt repayment on domestic borrowings.  Of
the $8.7 million in long-term debt and current maturities, $8.5 million
is currently domestic borrowing, principally a French Franc denominated
loan made in the U.S., for the purpose of hedging the Company's net
asset position in France, and an industrial revenue bond, for the
purpose of financing a domestic facility.  The remaining $.2 million of
long-term debt and current maturities and all $9.7 million of notes
payable consist of international subsidiary borrowings in local country
currencies, used primarily to finance working capital requirements.  

        During fiscal year 1994, cash dividends paid amounted to $16.5
million ($2.00 per share) compared to $16.6 million in 1993 ($2.00 per
share).  In addition to the regular quarterly dividend of $.25 per
share of Common Stock, on September 14, 1993, the directors of the
Company declared an extra cash dividend of $1.00 per share, which was
paid December 15, 1993.  On April 13, 1994, the directors of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.25 per share of
Common Stock to be paid June 15, 1994, to shareholders of record June
1, 1994.  As of both April 30, 1994 and 1993, dividends amounting to
$2.1 million had been declared, but not paid.


Operating Results
- - --------- -------

        Net sales of $680.0 million in the current fiscal year were even
with net sales of $679.9 million in fiscal 1993.  Net sales in fiscal
year 1993 were 1% higher than the $670.8 million reported in fiscal
year 1992.  Domestic sales in 1994 increased 14% from 1993, while
domestic sales reported in 1993 were 7% higher than 1992.  Sales from
international operations, other than hyper-inflationary countries,
decreased 3% in 1994 compared to 1993 when measured on a local currency
basis.  Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, however, sales from
international operations reflected a decrease of 14% as reported in
U.S. dollars.  The decrease in sales on a local currency basis was
primarily the result of continued weak international economic
conditions.  Sales in 1993 in those countries decreased 3% from 1992
when measured on a local currency basis and decreased 2% as reported in
U.S. dollars.  As measured in U.S. dollars, sales in the
hyper-inflationary countries remained even in 1994 as compared to 1993. 
Continued sales decreases in several Latin American countries were
offset by sales increases in operations in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Sales in the hyper-inflationary countries decreased 25% in 1993 over
1992, as measured and reported in U.S. dollars.  The majority of the
decrease in 1993 over 1992 in this group of subsidiaries occurred in
the Brazilian operations, due to deteriorating economic conditions.

        In fiscal year 1994, operating expenses increased only 2% over
1993; but due to relatively flat sales in 1994, operating margins
decreased to 7.4% of net sales from 8.9% in the prior year. 
Domestically, operating margins were approximately the same in 1994 as
compared to 1993.  Internationally, operating margins were
significantly lower in 1994 as compared to 1993, due to a decrease in
net sales and higher operating expenses.  Operating margins in 1993
were lower than the 9.9% in 1992,  due primarily to decreased sales in
the Company's international operations.

        In fiscal year 1994, the Company reported net interest income of
$2.0 million compared to net interest income of $5.0 million in 1993. 
Gross interest income decreased, due to lower interest rates on new
investments.  Gross interest expense was relatively even with the prior
year, as lower average debt in the Company's European subsidiaries
offset higher interest expense in the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries,
which had higher average debt during the year at extremely high
interest rates.  The $5.0 million in net interest income in fiscal 1993
compared to net interest income of $1.9 million in 1992.  Gross
interest expense decreased significantly in 1993 compared to 1992, due
to a lower average level of debt outstanding during the current year in
the Company's European and Brazilian subsidiaries.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        Loss on currency revaluation decreased to $.3 million in fiscal
year 1994 from $1.8 million in 1993.  In both years, net foreign
exchange losses in the Company's European operations represented the
majority of the loss on currency revaluation.  In the current year,
however, the net foreign exchange losses in the Company's European
operations were somewhat offset by net translation gains in the
Company's Brazilian operations.  Changes in the average net financial
position of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries resulted in net
translation gains in the Company's Brazilian operations for 1994.  In
fiscal 1993, loss on currency revaluation decreased to $1.8 million
from $2.1 million in fiscal 1992, also due to changes in the average
net financial position of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries during
1993.  Downsizing of the Brazilian subsidiaries during 1993 resulted in
a smaller asset position and, therefore, reduced translation expense
for 1993 compared to 1992.  Foreign exchange losses in various
countries and translation losses in hyper-inflationary countries other
than Brazil represented the balance of the loss on currency revaluation
in all three years.

        Net income in fiscal year 1994 decreased 17% to $31.2 million from
$37.6 million in 1993.  Net income in fiscal 1993 was 5% lower than the
$39.4 million reported in 1992.  In addition to the effects of
operating income, net interest and loss on currency revaluation on
pre-tax income, net income is affected by the overall corporate tax
rate for the year, which was 40.1% of pre-tax income in fiscal 1994
compared to 40.8% in 1993 and 40.3% in 1992.  A reconciliation of the
effective tax rates to U.S. statutory rates is contained in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Earnings per share decreased 17%
to $3.77 per share in 1994 due to the decrease in net income.  Earnings
per share in 1993 were $4.53, a 5% decrease from the $4.77 reported in
1992, due to lower net income in 1993.

        On a geographic area basis, net income in the United States
increased 8% to $20.5 million in fiscal year 1994, primarily as a
result of the 14% increase in sales and a lower effective income tax
rate.  Net income of $19.0 million in 1993 was higher than the $17.3
million reported in 1992, primarily due to increased sales and a lower
effective income tax rate in 1993 compared to 1992.

        Net income in Europe decreased from $17.0 million in fiscal 1993
to $12.8 million in 1994.  Net income in fiscal 1992 was $20.7 million. 
The decrease in net income from 1993 to 1994 was primarily attributable
to a combination of lower sales volume, the adverse effects of
translation rates and reduced net interest income due to a significant
decrease in average funds invested.  The decrease in net income from
1992 to 1993 was primarily attributable to a combination of lower sales
volume and higher effective tax rates.

        Net income in the Other International operations decreased from
$1.6 million net income in 1993 to a $2.1 million net loss in 1994 due
to lower sales, higher operating expenses, higher net interest expense
and higher effective tax rates in the current year.  Net income of $1.6
million was reported in fiscal 1993 compared to $1.4 million reported
in 1992.  In 1992, the Company made a $1.8 million provision for
restructuring its Brazilian subsidiaries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NCH Corporation and Subsidiaries
=========================================================================

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

   Principles of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of NCH Corporation and its majority owned
subsidiaries (the "Company").  Significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.  A February fiscal year-end is used for
most international subsidiaries in order to meet reporting requirements.

   Foreign currency translation - With the exception of hyper-
inflationary countries, all assets and liabilities of operations outside
the United States are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange
rates, and income and expenses are translated at average rates for the
year.  Gains and losses resulting from translation, as well as gains and
losses from foreign exchange contracts hedging the net assets of foreign
subsidiaries, are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment
component of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign exchange
contracts hedging specific intercompany foreign currency commitments are
deferred and accounted for as part of the hedged transaction.  The hyper-
inflationary countries have been translated into U.S. dollar equivalents
as follows:  current assets (except for inventories), current liabilities,
long-term debt and other liabilities at period-end exchange rates;
inventories, property, other assets, capital stock and retained earnings
at historical rates; income and expense items at average rates for the
year,except for cost of sales and depreciation expense, which are
translated at historical rates.  Gains and losses resulting from
translation are recognized in the income statement as expense or income in
the current period.  Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
transactions are recognized as expense or income in the current period for
all countries.

   Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities - Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase.  Cash equivalents and marketable securities are stated at
amortized cost plus accrued interest.      

   Inventories - Raw materials, sales supplies and purchased finished
goods are stated at a moving average cost, which approximates cost on a
first-in, first-out basis and is not in excess of market value. 
Manufactured finished goods are stated at an amount approximating cost of
manufacturing, which is not in excess of net realizable value.

   Property, plant and equipment - These assets are recorded at cost. 
When these assets are disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss
is included in income during that year.  The cost of maintenance and
repairs is charged to expense as incurred, whereas expenditures that
substantially increase the useful lives of plant or equipment are
capitalized.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

   Depreciation - Depreciation on buildings and equipment is provided for
financial statement purposes using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets.  Depreciation on certain
buildings and equipment is provided for income tax purposes using
accelerated methods.

   Research and development - Research and development costs, which are
included in the costs of laboratory operations, are charged to expense as
incurred.  Research and development costs, however, cannot be separately
identified from the total laboratory costs.  Total laboratory costs
amounted to approximately $4.4 million in 1994, $3.9 million in 1993 and
$3.4 million in 1992.

   Income taxes - Effective May 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." 
This statement requires a change from the deferred method under APB
Opinion 11 to the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Prior to the current year,
deferred income taxes were provided under the accounting rules then in
effect.  State income tax has been included in the provision for income
taxes and income taxes payable.  

   Treasury stock - Treasury stock is stated at cost.

   Retirement plans - The Company's policy is to fund its qualified
retirement type plans as accrued.  The cost of these retirement benefits
for past service has been fully funded.  Non-qualified retirement plans
are not funded, but provision for the estimated liabilities arising from
these plans has been made in the consolidated financial statements.

   Postretirement benefits other than pensions - The Company charges to
expense the estimated future costs of retiree health care benefits during
the years that employees render service.  The postretirement health care
benefit plan is not funded.

   Stock options - The Company issues shares from its treasury as options
are exercised.  When an option is exercised, treasury stock is credited
with the average cost of the treasury shares issued, and additional paid-
in capital is charged or credited for the difference between the option
price and the average cost of the treasury shares.  No charge to income is
made in connection with the stock option plan.

   Earnings per share - Earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each
year.  The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the years
ended April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, was 8,278,000, 8,298,000 and
8,261,000 shares, respectively.  Any dilution of earnings per share that
might result from the exercise of presently outstanding stock options is
not material.

   Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to current year presentation.

2. Consolidated International Subsidiaries

   At April 30, 1994 and 1993, the parent Company's investment in
consolidated international subsidiaries amounted to $40,782,000 and
$37,923,000.  The current year consolidated financial statements include
international subsidiaries' assets of $153,365,000, liabilities of
$67,221,000, and net income of $10,733,000, after allocation of corporate
expenses and excluding intercompany sales and profits.  For the prior year
these subsidiaries had assets of $166,776,000, liabilities of $63,336,000,
and net income of $18,583,000.

                               =======       =======       ======= 

   Effective May 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This
statement requires that deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences
on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.  The effect of adopting
SFAS No. 109 was not material to the Company's financial position as of
May 1, 1993, or to the operating results for the year ended April 30,
1994.  Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred taxes of the change in the
U.S. federal income tax rate from 34% to 35% was not material to the
operating results for the year ended April 30, 1994.

   The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 30,
1994 are as follows (in thousands of dollars):

   A valuation allowance has been provided for certain foreign net
operating loss carryforwards which are estimated to expire before they are
utilized.

   The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with
its domestic subsidiaries.  International subsidiaries file tax returns in
countries of their incorporation.  Certain of these subsidiaries have
operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $2,559,000, which will
expire between 1995 and 2004.  The accumulated undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries not included in the consolidated U.S. federal
income tax return approximated $69,378,000 at April 30, 1994, $83,280,000
at April 30, 1993 and $89,285,000 at April 30, 1992.  No provision is made
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the estimated
taxes that would result on distribution of the accumulated undistributed
earnings since the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the
operations of these subsidiaries.  For 1994, 1993 and 1992, worldwide
income tax payments amounted to $24,176,000, $24,205,000 and $26,324,000,
respectively.

    Principal on the industrial revenue bond is due on December 30, 2005,
although the bondholder has an option to put the bond to the Company
annually beginning in 1995.

7.  Employee Benefits

    Retirement plans - The parent and its domestic subsidiaries have
various qualified retirement type plans covering substantially all
domestic employees.  None of these plans have defined benefits.  Some of
the international subsidiaries also have non-defined benefit retirement
plans.  These plans are funded on a current basis, and the cost of
retirement benefits for past service has been fully funded.

    In addition, the Company has non-qualified deferred compensation plans
for the primary purpose of providing retirement benefits.  These plans are
not funded, but provision for the estimated liabilities arising from these
plans has been made in the consolidated financial statements.
    
    Expenses for retirement plans, exclusive of interest expense, were
$8,343,000, $4,737,000 and $6,968,000 in the years ended April 30, 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Postretirement benefits other than pensions - The Company and several
of its domestic subsidiaries initiated a postretirement health care
benefit plan in fiscal 1993, covering substantially all domestic
employees.  Eligible retirees receive a specific contribution from the
Company toward the cost of the health plan, which is a supplement to
Medicare.  The amount of the contribution is based on years of service
with the Company at retirement.  The plan is not funded; retiree health
benefits are paid as covered expenses are incurred.   Provision has been
made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the net

   The reconciliation of the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation to the recorded liability at April 30 is as follows (in
thousands of dollars):

                                                     ======      ====== 

   Measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is
based on a 7% assumed discount rate for 1994 and 8% for 1993.

   In addition, certain of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have
health care plans for retirees, although many retirees outside of the
United States are covered by government sponsored and administered
programs.   Under SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," the effective date for adoption for plans
outside of the United States is no later than fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994.  The Company has not yet determined when it will adopt
the standard for non-U.S. subsidiary plans, but estimates that its
implementation will not have a material effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

   Postemployment benefits - In November 1992, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits."  This statement requires recognition of a
liability for certain benefits provided to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement.  This statement must be adopted no
later than the first quarter of fiscal 1995.  Implementation of this
statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

   Other - The Company has some split dollar life insurance agreements,
whereby the Company pays a portion of the premiums.  The Company has been
granted a security interest in the cash value and death benefit of each
policy, to the extent of the sum of premium payments made by the Company. 
Premiums paid by the Company are charged to expense to the extent they
exceed the cash values of each policy.

8. Capital Stock and Options

   None of the Company's authorized 500,000 shares of $1 par value
Preferred Stock has been issued.

   On April 13, 1994, the directors of the Company declared a regular
quarterly cash dividend of $.25 per share of Common Stock to be paid June
15, 1994, to shareholders of record June 1, 1994.

   At April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, 761,000, 769,000 and 813,000 shares
of the Company's Common Stock, respectively, were reserved for issuance
under a non-qualified stock option plan which grants options to key
employees and officers.  The purchase price under the grant cannot be less
than the market value at the date of grant.  The options under such plan
are exercisable in equal amounts at the beginning of the second, third and
fourth year of their lives and expire after five years.  Information
relative to the non-qualified stock options for the three years ended
April 30, 1994, is as follows:

9. Interest Costs

   During the years ended April 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, interest costs,
including interest expense on non-funded retirement plans, amounting to
$5,115,000, $4,695,000 and $7,970,000, respectively, were expensed as
incurred.  For the same periods, interest payments were $4,200,000,
$3,182,000 and $6,675,000, respectively.

10.  Leases

   At April 30, 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries had a number of
noncancellable leases for various office and warehouse facilities.  The
majority of these agreements expire at various times through 1999, and
substantially all include renewal provisions.  The amount of other
obligations assumed, such as payment of property taxes and maintenance, is
nominal.  Total rent expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992  (including operating
leases on data processing equipment, trucks and trailers, and office
equipment) was approximately $8,538,000, $9,482,000 and $9,704,000,
respectively. 

   The minimum aggregate rentals under the terms of noncancellable
operating leases for future years are: 1995 - $6,353,000; 1996 -
$5,074,000; 1997 - $3,704,000; 1998 - $3,650,000; and a total of
$4,889,000 for 1999 and thereafter.

11.  Contingent Liabilities

   The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in a variety of legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including some
concerning environmental matters.  In the opinion of Management, the
ultimate liabilities resulting from these proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or operating
results.

   At April 30, 1993, the Company had a forward exchange contract with a
notional amount of approximately $600,000.  This contract had a maturity
of less than one year and the counterparty was a major domestic financial
institution.  There were no such contracts at April 30, 1994.  Gains or
losses resulting from contracts hedging net foreign currency positions
have been included in the foreign currency translation adjustment
component of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from all other
contracts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  In
addition, at April 30, 1994, the Company had standby letters of credit
outstanding totaling $8,890,000, which guarantee payment to certain
insurance carriers.

12.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, notes payable to
banks and current maturities of long-term debt approximate fair value,
because of the short maturities of these financial instruments.  The fair
values of marketable securities are estimated based on the quoted market
prices obtained from brokers.  The fair value of long-term debt, less
current maturities, is estimated based on the discounted value of future
cash flows, using the Company's current borrowing rate for loans of
comparable terms and maturities.

   Using the above methods and assumptions, the estimated fair values of
the Company's financial instruments at April 30 are as follows (in
thousands of dollars):

                                          1994                 1993

segment, which includes specialty chemicals, fasteners, welding supplies,
plumbing and electronic parts, and safety supplies.  Substantially all of
these products are sold for repair, maintenance or industrial supply use.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Stockholders and Board of Directors
NCH Corporation:
======================================================================

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NCH
Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April
30, 1994.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of NCH Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994 and 1993, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended April 30, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
=========================================================================

  The management of the Company is responsible for the financial
information and representations contained in the financial statements and
other sections of the annual report.  The financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, and
therefore include informed estimates and judgments.

  The Company's system of internal control is designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the integrity, objectivity
and reliability of the financial records and the safeguarding of assets. 
Management believes that, within a cost-effective framework, the
Company's accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that material
errors or irregularities are prevented or would be detected within a
relatively short period of time.  The possibility exists, however, that
errors or irregularities may occur and not be detected.  The Company has
a program of internal audits and follow-up, covering separate Company
operations and functions in the U.S. and its international subsidiaries.

  The Board of Directors pursues its review of the audit function,
internal controls and the financial statements largely through its Audit
Committee, which consists solely of directors who are not employees of
the Company.  The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, the
independent auditors and internal auditors with regard to their
respective responsibilities.  Both KPMG Peat Marwick and the internal
auditors have full access to the Audit Committee.  They meet with the
committee, without management present, to discuss the scope and results
of their examination, including internal control and financial reporting
matters.

  Management also recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong
ethical climate so that the Company's affairs are conducted according to
the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct.  This
responsibility is characterized and reflected in the Company's code of
corporate conduct, which is publicized throughout the Company.  The code
of conduct addresses, among other things, the necessity of ensuring open
communication within the Company; potential conflicts of interests;
compliance with all domestic and foreign laws, including those relating
to financial disclosure; and the confidentiality of proprietary
information.  The Company maintains a systematic program to assess
compliance with these policies.

                         ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

                              Dated: June 22, 1994

                    SOLICITATION AND REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

   The accompanying proxy is solicited by the management of, and on
behalf of, NCH Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("NCH"), to be voted at
the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of NCH, to be held Thursday, July
28, 1994 (the "Meeting"), at the time and place and for the purposes set
forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting.  When properly executed
proxies in the accompanying form are received, the shares represented
thereby will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the directions
noted on the proxies; if no direction is indicated, then such shares will
be voted for the election of the directors and in favor of the proposals
set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting attached to this Proxy Statement.

   The enclosed proxy confers discretionary authority to vote with
respect to any and all of the following matters that may come before the
Meeting:  (1) matters that NCH's Board of Directors does not know a
reasonable time before the Meeting are to be presented at the Meeting; and
(2) matters incidental to the conduct of the Meeting.  Management does not
intend to present any business for a vote at the Meeting other than the
matters set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting, and it has
no information that others will do so.  If other matters requiring the vote
of the stockholders properly come before the Meeting, then, subject to the
limitations set forth in the applicable regulations under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, it is the intention of the persons named in the
attached form of proxy to vote the proxies held by them in accordance with
their judgment on such matters.

   Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke that proxy at
any time before it is voted.  A proxy may be revoked by filing with the
Secretary of NCH either a written revocation or a duly executed proxy
bearing a date subsequent to the date of the proxy being revoked.  Any
stockholder may attend the Meeting and vote in person, whether or not such
stockholder has previously submitted a proxy.

   In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, officers and regular
employees of NCH may solicit the return of proxies.  Brokerage houses and
other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries may be requested to forward
solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock.   This Proxy
Statement and the accompanying proxy are first being sent or given to NCH's
stockholders on or about June 24, 1994.

   NCH will bear the cost of preparing, printing, assembling, and mailing
the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement, the enclosed proxy, and
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

any additional material, as well as the cost of forwarding solicitation
material to the beneficial owners of stock.
                   

                                 VOTING RIGHTS

   The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and
to vote at the Meeting is the close of business on June 1, 1994.  On that
date there were 8,280,040 shares issued and outstanding of NCH's $1.00 par
value common stock ("Common Stock"), which is NCH's only class of voting
securities outstanding.  Each share of NCH's Common Stock is entitled to
one vote in the matter of election of directors and in any other matter
that may be acted upon at the Meeting.  Neither NCH's certificate of
incorporation nor its bylaws permits cumulative voting.  The presence, in
person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Meeting is necessary to constitute
a quorum at the Meeting, but in no event will a quorum consist of less than
one-third of the shares entitled to vote at the Meeting.  The affirmative
vote of a plurality of the shares of Common Stock represented at the
Meeting and entitled to vote is required to elect directors.  All other
matters to be voted on will be decided by a majority of the shares of
Common Stock represented at the meeting and entitled to vote.  Abstentions
and broker nonvotes are each included in determining the number of shares
present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum.  Abstentions
and broker nonvotes have no effect on determining plurality, except to the
extent that they affect the total votes received by any particular
candidate.  With respect to the proposal to approve an incentive bonus plan
for members of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors,
abstentions have the effect of votes against the proposal and broker
nonvotes are not counted.


                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

   NCH's Board of Directors consists of seven members, divided into three
classes:  Class I (two directors), Class II (three directors), and Class
III (two directors).  Only the Class III positions are due for nomination
and election at the Meeting.  The Class I and Class II positions will be
due for nomination and election at the annual meetings of stockholders to
be held in 1995 and 1996, respectively.

   The intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy, unless such
proxy specifies otherwise, is to vote the shares represented by such proxy
for the election of Jerrold M. Trim and Irvin L. Levy as the Class III
directors.  Messrs. Jerrold M. Trim and Irvin L. Levy have been nominated
to stand for re-election by the Board of Directors until their terms expire
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Messrs. Jerrold M. Trim and Irvin L. Levy are presently directors of NCH. 
Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy are brothers.  Robert L. Blumenthal
is a first cousin of Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy.  Certain
information regarding each nominee and director is set forth below.  The
number of shares beneficially owned by each nominee is listed under
"Security Ownership of Principal Stockholders and Management."

                 Meeting Attendance and Committees of the Board

by consent at least 33 times, and the Stock Option Committee met once.  NCH
does not have a standing nominating committee of the Board.  Nominees to
the Board are selected by the entire Board.

   The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the scope of the independent
auditors' examinations and the scope of activities of NCH's internal
auditors.  Additionally, it receives and reviews reports of NCH's
independent auditors and internal auditors.  The Audit Committee also meets
(without management's presence, if the Audit Committee so desires) with the
independent auditors and members of the internal auditing staff, receives
recommendations or suggestions for change, and may initiate or supervise
any special investigations it may choose to undertake.

   The Compensation Committee recommends to the Board of Directors the
salaries of Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy.

   The Executive Committee possesses all of the powers of the Board of
Directors between meetings of the Board.

   The Stock Option Committee of the Board determines those employees of
NCH and its subsidiaries who will receive stock options and the amount of
such options.


                    PROPOSAL TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
                              INCENTIVE BONUS PLAN


   Section 162(m), which was added to the Internal Revenue Code in August
1993, denies the deduction for compensation over $1 million per year paid
by a publicly traded company to the chief executive and the four other most
highly compensated officers.  Compensation based on performance goals and
approved by the stockholders is excluded from the limitation on deductions
over $1 million.  To qualify for the exclusion: (i) the compensation must
be paid solely for achieving performance goals; (ii) the performance goals
must be established by a compensation committee consisting of outside
directors; (iii) the terms under which the compensation will be paid,
including the performance goals, must be described to and approved by
stockholders; and (iv) prior to payment, the compensation committee must
certify that the performance goals and other terms were satisfied.

   To qualify all compensation paid to the Executive Committee of the
Board of Directors as a deductible expense under Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code, on April 28, 1994, the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors adopted an incentive bonus plan (the "Bonus Plan"),
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

subject to stockholder approval, for members of the Executive Committee.

   The Bonus Plan provides a formula for determining the amounts of
annual bonuses to be paid to each member of the Executive Committee.  Bonus
amounts will depend on the amount by which NCH's net income after taxes,
but before accrual for any bonus under the Bonus Plan, for a particular
fiscal year increases over its net income for the preceding fiscal year. 
If net income increases less than 10%, then no bonus will be paid. 
Increases from 10% to less than 14% will result in payment of a $225,000
bonus to each member of the Executive Committee.  Increases from 14% to
less than 16% will result in payment of a $300,000 bonus to each Executive
Committee member.  Increases of 16% or more will result in payment of a
$375,000 bonus to each member of the Executive Committee.

   The Bonus Plan prohibits amendment of its terms to increase the cost
of the Bonus Plan to NCH or to change the persons to whom bonuses will be
paid under the Bonus Plan without a vote of NCH's stockholders.

   The following table summarizes the amounts that would have been
received by or allocated to each member of the Executive Committee for the
last three completed fiscal years had the Bonus Plan been in effect.

                COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

Director Compensation

     Directors who are not executive officers of NCH receive compensation
of $25,000 per annum and $1,000 for each meeting of the Board of Directors
or Board committee attended.  All other directors receive $1,000 for each
such meeting attended.  Members of the Stock Option Committee and Executive
Committee are not compensated separately for their services on such
committees.

Report on Executive Compensation

Responsibility for Executive Compensation

     Three outside directors, as the Compensation Committee of NCH
(Messrs. Fulgham, Trim, and Walker), have primary responsibility for
recommending to the Board the executive compensation program for Messrs.
Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy.  The Compensation Committee recommends to
the Board an annual aggregate base compensation for the Office of the
Executive Committee and, pending shareholder approval of the Executive
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Committee Bonus Plan, is responsible for administering and approving
incentive compensation for the Office of the Executive Committee.  After
Board approval of the Compensation Committee's recommendation for aggregate
base compensation (with Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy abstaining),
the Messrs. Levy divide the compensation of the Executive Committee among
themselves.  Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy are responsible for
administering the compensation program for all other officers of NCH.

Executive Compensation Strategy

     With respect to compensation of all key executives other than
Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy, NCH's strategy is generally as
follows:

        Attract and retain key executives by delivering a market
        competitive rate of base pay.  Market competitive rates of pay are
        determined by reviewing compensation data from other companies
        that resemble NCH in terms of lines of business, size, scope, and
        complexity.

        Provide salary increases to key executives based on their
        individual effort and performance.  In addition to the
        individual's experience, job duties, and performance, annual
        increases are influenced by NCH's overall performance.

        Provide annual incentive opportunities based on objectives that
        NCH feels are critical to its success during the year.  Target
        incentive levels are set on an individual basis and actual awards
        are made at the Executive Committee's discretion.

        Provide long-term incentives to key employees so that employees
        are focused on activities and decisions that promote NCH's
        long-term financial and operational success.  To meet this
        objective, NCH offers stock options to certain key employees. 
        Options are generally granted for a period of five years at a
        price that is at least equal to the fair market value of the
        Common Stock at the time of grant.  Options vest in equal
        increments over a three-year period from the time of grant.


Compensation of Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy

     The Compensation Committee occasionally seeks assistance and relies
on compensation data supplied by an outside compensation consulting firm to
determine the competitiveness of NCH's compensation programs.  Based on
survey and proxy analyses performed by the consulting firm, the
Compensation Committee believes that the aggregate compensation for the
Office of the Executive Committee to be at the 75th percentile of total
direct compensation (base salary plus annual incentives plus present value
of long-term incentives granted) in chemical companies and other industrial
companies of similar size.  Given the tenure and depth of experience of the
Office of the Executive Committee, the Compensation Committee feels that
this is an appropriate competitive level of compensation.  All of the
companies in the peer group in NCH's performance graph on page 10 of this
Proxy Statement are included in the proxy analysis performed by the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

consulting firm.  NCH's performance in sales and earnings in the then
current economic and competitive environment, adjusted for currency
fluctuations, is considered in setting executive compensation, although no
formula or preset goal is used.

     NCH has adopted a separate strategy with respect to the incentive
compensation of the Office of the Executive Committee (Messrs. Irvin,
Lester, and Milton Levy).  Since these individuals are very significant
long-term stockholders of NCH, some of the typical approaches to executive
compensation that exist in the marketplace are not necessarily relevant at
NCH.  Long-term incentive programs are implemented for senior executives to
create a link between the corporation's performance and the executive's own
personal wealth.  In light of the shareholding of Messrs. Irvin, Lester,
and Milton Levy, they are already significantly impacted financially by
NCH's overall performance.  The Compensation Committee generally feels that
in this situation any long-term incentive program should be tied to salary
or bonus.

     In terms of short-term incentive compensation, NCH is submitting the
Executive Committee Bonus Plan for stockholder approval at the Meeting. 
Since aggregate compensation for the Office of the Executive Committee
could result in a member receiving over $1 million in annual compensation,
NCH finds it necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code to qualify for tax deductibility all compensation
paid to the Executive Committee.  NCH's policy is to qualify to the extent
practicable all compensation paid to its executive officers for tax
deductibility in accordance with Section 162(m).  The stockholders must
approve the Bonus Plan before it goes into effect.

Conclusion

     The Compensation Committee believes that current compensation
arrangements in place at NCH are reasonable and competitive given NCH's
size and status and the current regulatory environment surrounding
executive compensation.  The base salary program allows NCH to attract and
retain management talent.  In addition, for those employees who are
incentive eligible, such systems continue to provide the necessary link
between the attainment of NCH's performance objectives and the compensation
received by executives.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation
Decisions
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

  Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy are members of the Executive
Committee of NCH's Board of Directors, which committee determines most
salaries and promotions with respect to officers of NCH and its
subsidiaries, and of the Stock Option Committee, which determines those
employees of NCH and its subsidiaries who will receive stock options and
the amount of such options.  Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy are
executive officers and employees of NCH.

  NCH's Board of Directors (with the subject members abstaining)
determines the salaries of Messrs. Irvin, Lester, and Milton Levy after
recommendation of the Compensation Committee, whose members are J. Rawles
Fulgham, Jr., Jerrold M. Trim, and Thomas B. Walker, Jr.

  Executive Compensation

  The following table summarizes the compensation paid to Messrs. Irvin,
Lester, and Milton Levy, who together hold the office of the Executive
Committee, and to NCH's two other most highly compensated executive
officers (whose compensation exceeded $100,000 in fiscal 1994) for services
rendered in all capacities to NCH during the fiscal years ended April 30,
1994, 1993, and 1992.

(2) Includes compensation for services as a director (other than Mr.
    Hetzer and Mr. Scivally). 

(3) The amounts included in this column were contributed to the accounts
    of the executives included in the table under NCH's qualified profit
    sharing and savings plan.  Compensation that would otherwise be
    included in this column for fiscal year 1992 has been omitted pursuant
    to the phase-in provisions of the executive compensation rules
    promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


    Retirement Agreements

    NCH has entered into retirement agreements with Messrs. Irvin, Lester,
and Milton Levy that provide for lifetime monthly payments and guarantee
120 monthly payments beginning at death, retirement, or disability. 
Payments under these agreements will be $385,000 per year, subject to
adjustment each year after 1993 for increases in the United States Consumer
Price Index for the preceding year.


                              CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

    NCH has entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with the
sons of Lester A. Levy and Irvin L. Levy who are NCH employees and with
Lester A. Levy's daughter, concerning the purchase of life insurance
policies insuring Irvin L. Levy, Lester A. Levy, and Milton P. Levy, Jr. 
The employee or daughter pays the "economic benefit" portion of the premium
(computed under Internal Revenue Code Rulings 55-747 and 66-110) and NCH
pays the rest of the premium.  The premium averages approximately $570,000
per year for the remaining premium payment period, estimated to be 15
years.  The impact of these policies on after-tax earnings was $98,000 in
fiscal 1994.  Because of the cash value build up of the policies, they
should have either no material effect or a positive effect on earnings in
subsequent years.  The insurance provides benefits to the above indicated
employees totalling $10,000,000 on the death of combinations of insureds. 
NCH has been granted a security interest in the cash value and death
benefit of each policy to the extent of the sum of premium payments made by
NCH.  These arrangements are designed so that if the assumptions made as to
mortality experience, policy earnings, and other factors are realized, then
NCH will recover all of its premium payments.

    The purpose of the arrangement in addition to providing benefits to
the employees is to provide cash to the families of Messrs. Lester and
Irvin Levy at the approximate time of death of the senior Levys to avoid
their Common Stock being forced on to the market at a potentially
inappropriate time.


                FIVE YEAR COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN 


    The following graph presents NCH's cumulative stockholder return
during the period beginning April 30, 1989, and ending April 30, 1994.  NCH
is compared to the S&P 500 and a peer group consisting of companies that
collectively represent lines of business in which NCH competes.  The

companies included in the peer group index are Betz Laboratories, Inc., The
Dexter Corporation, Ecolab Inc., Lawson Products, Inc., Nalco Chemical
Company, National Service Industries, Inc., Petrolite Corporation, Premier
Industrial Corporation, Quaker Chemical Corporation, Safety-Kleen Corp.,
and Snap-On Tools Corporation.  Each index assumes $100 invested at the
close of trading on April 30, 1989, and is calculated assuming quarterly
reinvestment of dividends and quarterly weighting by market capitalization.
