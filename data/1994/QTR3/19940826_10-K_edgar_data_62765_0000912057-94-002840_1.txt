Year Ended May 31, 1994
PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

    Electronics  distributors form an integral part of the electronics industry.
Most domestic  and  foreign  manufacturers  of  electronic  components  rely  on
independent   authorized  distributors,   such  as   Marshall  Industries  ("the
Company"), to augment  their product marketing  operations and provide  stocking
and  service  capabilities. These  manufacturers  are relying  to  an increasing
extent on distributors to market their products.

    The Company is the  fourth largest domestic distributor  in sales volume  of
industrial electronic components and production supplies. Through its network of
36  sales and distribution  facilities and 3  corporate support and distribution
centers in the  United States and  Canada, the Company  supplies and services  a
broad   range  of   products,  including   semiconductors,  passive  components,
connectors and  interconnect  products,  and  computer  systems  and  peripheral
products,  as  well  as  production  supplies.  The  distribution  of electronic
components accounted for  approximately 91% and  94% of total  Company sales  in
fiscal  1993 and 1994,  respectively. The distribution  of industrial production
supplies accounted for the balance or 9% and 6%, respectively, of total  Company
sales  in each of such periods. The  Company believes it is the largest domestic
distributor in sales volume  of industrial production  supplies to customers  in
the electronics industry.

ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS DISTRIBUTION

    The  distribution of semiconductor products  accounted for approximately 62%
and 70%, respectively, of total Company  sales in fiscal 1993 and 1994.  Passive
components, connectors and interconnect products accounted for approximately 16%
and  13%,  respectively, of  total  Company sales  for  those periods.  Sales of
computer systems and  peripheral products  accounted for  approximately 13%  and
11%, respectively, of total Company sales in fiscal 1993 and 1994.

    Texas  Instruments ("TI") is the Company's largest supplier of semiconductor
products. TI's semiconductor products accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of
total Company sales in fiscal 1993  and 1994, respectively. The Company  carries
the  full range of semiconductor products manufactured by TI and distributes the
products of a  number of other  leading American manufacturers.  The Company  is
also the major distributor in sales volume of Japanese semiconductor products in
the  United States. Sales of these  products accounted for approximately 16% and
19% of total Company sales in fiscal 1993 and 1994, respectively.  Additionally,
the  Company distributes components manufactured  by European suppliers, such as
Siemens Components, Inc. ("Siemens"),  Philips Semiconductors, a North  American
Philips    Company   ("Philips"),   formerly    "Signetics,"   and   SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics Inc. ("SGS-Thomson").

    The Company purchases electronic components from over 50 major suppliers  in
the following general categories:

    SEMICONDUCTOR  PRODUCTS:   Semiconductor products include  memory, logic and
programmable logic devices, microprocessors and microperipheral components.  The
Company's  principal suppliers are  Brooktree Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor
Corp., Fujitsu, Hitachi, Lattice  Semiconductor Corporation, Linear  Technology,
Philips, NEC, Siemens, SGS-Thomson, TI, Toshiba America, Inc. and Xilinx, Inc.

    During  late fiscal 1993, Atmel Corp. and IBM Technology Products, a unit of
IBM, awarded the Company franchise agreements to distribute their  semiconductor
products.

                                       2
<PAGE>

    PASSIVE  COMPONENTS:  The Company  distributes passive components, including
multilayer ceramic, tantalum and foil  capacitors as well as resistor  networks.
These  products are manufactured by such leading suppliers as AVX Corporation, a
subsidiary of Kyocera Corporation and Bourns, Inc.

    CONNECTORS AND INTERCONNECT PRODUCTS:  Connectors and interconnect  products
include  surface  mount  sockets and  fiber  optic systems,  along  with printed
circuit board level connectors. The Company's principal suppliers of  connectors
and interconnect products are AMP Incorporated and T&B/Ansley Corporation, which
rank among the leading suppliers of these products.

    COMPUTER  SYSTEMS AND PERIPHERALS:   The Company's product offerings include
printers, keyboards,  optical, hard  and floppy  disk drives,  monitors,  mother
boards  for personal  computers, power  supplies, and  other systems components.
Computer Products Inc., Fujitsu, IBM Personal Computer Company, NEC Electronics,
Inc., Sharp  Electronics  Corporation,  Sony Components  Products,  and  Toshiba
America  Information Systems, Inc. are the  major suppliers of these products to
the Company.

    VALUE ADDED SERVICES:  In addition  to the distribution of component  parts,
the  Company provides a  variety of value  added services to  its customers. The
Company provides programmable logic array and PROM and EPROM programming,  along
with  certain types  of testing services.  The Company  also packages electronic
component kits  to  customers'  specifications ("kitting")  and  provides  cable
assembling  services. Through  the use of  third party  contractors, the Company
provides contract manufacturing capabilities.

PRODUCTION SUPPLIES DISTRIBUTION

    The Company believes that  it is the largest  domestic distributor in  sales
volume  of  industrial  production  supplies  to  customers  in  the electronics
industry.  Such   supplies  include   hand  tools,   static  control   products,
instrumentation,  solder, soldering  irons and work  stations. Leading suppliers
include Cooper Tools, a division of Cooper Industries, Kester Solder, a division
of Litton Industries, Tektronix, Inc., and 3M.

MARKETS

    The Company  currently has  a national  distribution network  in the  United
States  and  Canada  consisting  of  36 sales  and  distribution  centers  and 3
corporate support and  distribution centers.  The Company believes  that it  has
sales  facilities in all of the major  electronic products markets in the United
States, including the Los  Angeles/Orange County, San Francisco/Silicon  Valley,
Boston,  Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia, Portland, Seattle, Connecticut, Florida,
New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio  and Texas areas. In Canada,  the
Company  has  sales facilities  in  Toronto and  Montreal.  As a  result  of the
Company's marketing strategy  and expansion programs,  the Company is  currently
distributing  products  manufactured  by  over  50  major  electronic  component
suppliers to approximately 30,000 customers.

    As described in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has  entered
into  an agreement to make an  investment in Sonepar Electronique International,
the third largest electronic component distributor in Europe.

    At  May  31,   1994,  the   Company  had   approximately  1,450   employees,
substantially all of whom were employed full-time.

                                       3

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETING

    Distributors  offer electronics customers the convenience of immediate price
and delivery information, backlog  status, diverse off-the-shelf inventories  in
small  and  large  quantities,  rapid  deliveries  and  the  financing  of their
purchases.   The   Company's   electronics   distribution   business    services
approximately  30,000 customers, the majority of which are small and medium size
original  equipment  manufacturers  ("OEM's")   in  the  fields  of   computers,
communications,  capital and  office equipment,  industrial control  and medical
equipment. In  recent  years,  contract manufacturers  have  also  become  major
customers  for electronic component distributors, including the Company, as many
OEM's have outsourced their purchasing  and manufacturing functions to them.  No
single  customer accounted for more than 4% of the Company's sales during any of
the last five fiscal years.

    The Company's products are sold by both field and inside sales people. Sales
personnel work directly  with customers providing  price, delivery, backlog  and
technical information regarding the products which the Company distributes. Each
sales  and distribution center is electronically linked to the Company's central
computer system, which  provides fully integrated  on-line, real-time data  with
respect  to the  Company's nationwide  inventory levels.  The Company's computer
system  facilitates  the  control  of  purchasing  and  payables,  shipping  and
receiving,  and billing and  collections. A salesperson may  order shipment of a
product from any distribution center within a matter of minutes. The Company has
made significant investments,  particularly during  the last  several years,  to
increase  the capabilities of its computerized information systems. In December,
1992, the  Company  implemented new  computer  software for  its  operating  and
financial  systems. The  Company had  invested approximately  $9 million  in the
design, purchase, and  implementation of these  systems. In the  opinion of  the
Company,  these  systems,  which were  written  in a  contemporary  language and
architecture, have the capabilities to  support future changes and  enhancements
required to meet market needs and growth. Due to the high volume of transactions
and   the  cost  competitiveness  of  the  electronics  components  distribution
industry,  the  Company  believes  that  the  expansion  and  upgrading  of  its
computerized  information systems will be an ongoing requirement. In July, 1994,
the Company  introduced an  electronic  telecommunications service  that  allows
customers  to design,  engineer and  purchase products  via the  "Internet". The
Company believes that it is the first major electronic component distributor  to
offer this service.

    The  Company has  focused on obtaining  franchises with  suppliers which are
among the  leading manufacturers  of  the product  categories that  the  Company
distributes.  In addition, the Company has established distributor relationships
with suppliers of emerging high technology products, such as Brooktree, Cypress,
Lattice, Linear  Technology, and  Xilinx. The  Company offers  a broad  line  of
products  to meet  its customers' needs.  The Company has  also concentrated its
inventory and  marketing efforts  on the  following product  categories that  it
believes  are the greatest  growth areas of the  distribution business: (1) high
performance memory and programmable logic devices; (2) data conversion products;
(3) microprocessors; (4) computer systems  and peripherals; (5) printed  circuit
board  level connectors; (6)  passive components; and  (7) industrial production
supplies and instrumentation.  Additionally, the Company  is focusing on  having
its  sales  force  sell a  balanced  mix of  all  types of  products  along with
expanding its customer base.

RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPPLIERS

    The majority of the products sold  by the Company are purchased pursuant  to
distributor  agreements. These agreements  are typically for  terms of one year,
renewable annually, non-exclusive, and authorize the Company to sell through its
sales and distribution centers all or a portion of the products produced by that
manufacturer. These agreements may be cancelled by either party on short  notice
and  generally  provide  for  a  return  of  the  manufacturer's  inventory upon
cancellation. The Company's  ten largest suppliers  accounted for  approximately
51%  and 54%,  respectively, of  total Company  sales in  fiscal 1993  and 1994.
Except for TI, which accounted for 14% and 15% of total Company sales for fiscal
1993 and 1994, no other supplier accounted for more than 10%. Cancellation of an
agreement with, or trade restrictions affecting purchases from, a major supplier
could have a material  adverse effect upon the  Company's business. The  Company
believes that it has a

                                       4
<PAGE>

satisfactory  relationship with each of its suppliers. The Company considers its
relationships with its Japanese suppliers  to be sound. Nonetheless, because  of
uncertainties  relating  to  U.S.  trade  issues,  the  possibility  exists that
continued access  to  Japanese products  could  be affected.  In  addition,  the
Company  cannot determine the  direction of U.S. trade  issues or their ultimate
effect on the competitive environment and the Company's results.

    Most   manufacturers   of    electronic   components,   including    foreign
manufacturers,  protect authorized  distributors, such  as the  Company, against
potential inventory losses  from declining prices  and obsolescence. To  protect
its  distributors  from  declining  market  prices,  most  electronic  component
manufacturers allow their distributors pricing adjustments as products are  sold
to  customers  as well  as credits  on unsold  inventory when  the manufacturers
reduce prices on their price  lists. In addition, under  the terms of many  such
agreements,  the distributor  has the right  to return to  the manufacturer, for
credit, any product classified as obsolete  by the manufacturer and a  specified
portion of other inventory items purchased within a designated period of time. A
manufacturer  who elects to terminate a  distribution agreement without cause is
generally required  to  purchase  from  the distributor  the  products  of  such
manufacturer  carried in the  distributor's inventory. While  such agreements do
not protect the Company  totally from inventory losses,  such agreements do,  in
management's  opinion,  provide  substantial  protection  from  such  losses. No
assurance can be given, however, that such price adjustment and return  policies
will continue.

    To  service  its kitting  and turnkey  contract manufacturing  customers, as
described on page  3, the Company  must buy  a certain amount  of products  from
third  parties on a non-franchised basis. Since there are typically no return or
price protection privileges on these purchases, there are significantly  greater
inventory  risks  associated  with kitting  and  turnkey  contract manufacturing
orders than  with  the  purchase  and stocking  of  inventory  pursuant  to  its
franchise agreements.

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND COMPETITION

    Although  the Company's business is not seasonal to any material extent, its
business is affected  by the  cyclical nature  of the  electronics industry  and
overall  trends in the general economy. In addition, the Company has experienced
industry-wide product shortages and  excess supplies from  time to time.  During
the last several years, there have been shortages of and long lead times on some
semiconductor  products,  particularly surface  mount  logic and  certain memory
devices. In  recent months  however, the  availability and  lead times  of  many
products have returned to normal levels.

    Supplying  and servicing  the electronics  industry is  a highly competitive
business. The competition  is from other  large national distributors,  numerous
local  and regional  distributors, as well  as some of  the Company's suppliers.
Providing service to customers is the major competitive factor of the  industry.
In   addition  to  providing  basic  distribution  services  such  as  technical
information, product availability and  competitive pricing, prompt delivery  and
credit,  the  Company  offers  many sophisticated  value  added  services. These
additional services include component testing and assembly; just in time ("JIT")
inventory management and  delivery systems; kitting  and contract assembly;  and
sophisticated  computer interface  services such as  electronic data interchange
("EDI"). The Company  considers its emphasis  on high-quality customer  service,
monitored  by  statistical process  control ("SPC")  methods, to  be one  of its
strengths.

    From  time  to   time,  the   Company  has   experienced  competition   from
"unauthorized"  U.S. distributors of Japanese  semiconductors who purchase these
products in  foreign countries  at  prices below  those  which the  Company  may
purchase  such  products directly  from its  suppliers.  In addition,  a limited
number of the Company's customers have moved their manufacturing operations  out
of  the United  States in  recent years.  Such changes  have not  had a material
impact on the Company's business.

    Information concerning backlog is  not material to  an understanding of  the
Company's business, as the Company's objective is to ship orders on the same day
they are received unless the customer has requested a

                                       5
<PAGE>

specific  future delivery date on an  order. Additionally, it is common industry
practice for  customers, in  most cases,  to be  able to  re-schedule or  cancel
orders  with  future  delivery  dates  without  penalties.  In  the  electronics
industry, the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of sales orders received to
shipments made, is commonly used as an indicator of business trends. Since  late
calendar  1991, the  book-to-bill ratios for  both the industry  and the Company
have been generally positive.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    The Company  presently  has  36  sales and  distribution  facilities  and  3
corporate  support and distribution centers. The Company's executive offices and
corporate support and distribution center  are located in El Monte,  California.
This facility is Company owned, has 258,000 square feet of space and utilizes an
automated  inventory handling system. In addition  to this facility, the Company
is using one other facility in El Monte for its regional warehousing  functions.
It is also Company owned and has approximately 65,500 square feet of warehousing
and general office space.

    In  addition  to  the El  Monte  facilities,  a majority  of  the  sales and
distribution facilities located in Marshall's  major markets are Company  owned.
The  three largest facilities  range from approximately  58,000 to approximately
65,000 square feet  in size  and are  located in  Milpitas, California;  Irvine,
California  and  Boston,  Massachusetts.  The Company  also  owns  facilities in
Austin, Texas,  Endicott,  New  York, San  Diego,  California  and  Wallingford,
Connecticut of approximately 8,000 to 15,000 square feet each.

    The Company leases its remaining sales and distribution facilities. They are
located  in  cities  throughout  the  United States  and  Canada,  vary  in size
depending on sales volume and are  subject to leases whose initial terms  expire
at  various dates through fiscal 2000. Substantially all of those leases include
renewal provisions.

    In the opinion of the Company,  the current facilities are adequate for  the
Company's operating requirements.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    There  are no material pending  legal proceedings to which  the Company is a
party.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993

    The  increase in net sales for fiscal  1994, as compared to fiscal 1993, was
due to  an increase  in the  sales volume  of semiconductor  products. Sales  of
semiconductor  products  increased by  $178,237,000 as  a  result of  the strong
market demand and  additional sales of  products from new  suppliers. The  sales
volume  of  the  Company's  other major  products  was  relatively  unchanged or
decreased modestly from the prior year.

    The decrease in net margins for fiscal 1994, as compared to fiscal 1993, was
due to a decline in  the margins of most of  the Company's major products.  This
decline  in margins resulted from market pressures on the pricing of many of the
Company's products, including some of the Company's value added products, and an
increase in  the sales  volume of  lower  margin products,  such as  DRAMS.  The
Company  believes that  these conditions affecting  margins may  continue in the
near term.

    The increase in selling, general and administrative ("SG & A") expenses,  in
dollars,  for fiscal  1994, as  compared to  fiscal 1993,  was primarily  due to
higher operating costs to support the  significant increase in sales volume.  In
addition,  the Company is  amortizing $463,000 per  quarter of deferred computer
software costs  associated with  its new  operating and  financial systems  that
became  operational  in December,  1992. Fiscal  1994  expenses also  included a
charge of $890,000 that was recorded in  the first quarter related to the  costs
of  the  elimination  of  approximately  120  positions.  These  positions  were
eliminated as of August 31, 1993 by a reorganization of the Company's field  and
corporate  support functions. The  amounts incurred for the  last nine months of
fiscal 1994 would have been higher  except for the savings from the  elimination
of  these  positions.  This  reorganization reduced  the  Company's  fiscal 1994
expenses by approximately $1,000,000 per  quarter beginning the second  quarter.
Primarily  due to the savings from the August, 1993 restructuring and the higher
sales volume, SG & A as a percentage of sales declined significantly for  fiscal
1994  as  compared to  fiscal 1993.  The SG  &  A amounts  for fiscal  1993 also
included  some  extraordinary  levels  of  expenses  related  to  the  Company's
conversion  to its new computer software  systems in December, 1992. As reported
previously, the  Company  estimated  that it  had  incurred  approximately  $2.4
million to $2.9 million in additional costs, affecting both cost of sales and SG
& A expenses in fiscal 1993 associated with the computer software conversion.

    Interest  expense for fiscal 1994  remained relatively unchanged from fiscal
1993, as lower borrowing levels were  offset by higher interest rates  beginning
in late fiscal 1994.

    In  August, 1993 the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  of 1933 was enacted
which essentially increased  the Company's  Federal tax  rate from  34% to  35%.
Additionally,  as a result of  the Act, a retroactive  Federal tax adjustment of
$163,000, or $.02  per share, was  charged to  income tax expense  in the  first
quarter of fiscal 1994 for the period of January to May 1993.

FISCAL 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1992

    The  increase in net sales for fiscal  1993, as compared to fiscal 1992, was
primarily due to  an increase  in the  sales volume  of semiconductor  products.
Sales  of such products increased  by $77,859,000. The increase  in the sales of
semiconductor products  was the  result  of increased  market demand  for  these
products and the successful execution of the Company's marketing strategies. The
sales volume of the Company's other major products was relatively unchanged.

    The decrease in margins for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1993, as
compared  to  fiscal  1992, was  largely  due to  a  decline in  the  margins of
semiconductor and value added  products. This decrease  was attributable to  the
market  pressures on the pricing of some of the Company's products. In addition,
the Company's acceptance  of some  large customer  orders at  lower than  normal
margins  contributed to the decline in the  Company's margins. There was also an
increase in  the volume  of the  Company's lower  margin value  added  products,
particularly  the programming of semiconductors, during  the last half of fiscal
1993. Lastly,  additional expenses  were incurred  during the  third quarter  of
fiscal   1993,  due  to   some  problems  with   the  Company's  conversion  and
implementation of new computer software for its operating and financial  systems
in

                                       10
<PAGE>

December, 1992. These expenses contributed to the overall decline in margins for
the  third quarter and included  some higher than normal  levels of overtime for
value added  services,  missed  vendor discounts  and  credits,  and  additional
expenses from customer billing problems.

    The  increase in dollars of SG & A expenses for the third quarter and fiscal
1993, as compared to fiscal 1992, partly relates to short-term expenses incurred
as a result  of the  conversion to new  computer software  systems in  December,
1992.  These expenses consisted  of overtime costs,  higher than normal delivery
costs to  satisfy customer  demands, additional  computer consultant  costs  and
other  out-of-pocket costs. As described in  Note 1 to the financial statements,
expenses during the last half of  fiscal 1993 also included the amortization  of
$926,000  in deferred computer  software costs. In  addition, compensation costs
and other operating expenses increased during fiscal 1993, as compared to fiscal
1992, as a  result of the  significantly higher sales  volume and  profitability
levels.

    The  Company estimates that  it incurred approximately  $1.5 million to $2.0
million in additional costs, affecting both cost  of sales and SG & A  expenses,
associated  with the conversion and implementation  of the new computer software
systems in the third quarter  of fiscal 1993. These  amounts do not include  the
amortization  of the deferred computer software costs described in the preceding
paragraph. The Company  also incurred approximately  $900,000 during the  fourth
quarter  of  fiscal  1993  for consulting  costs  associated  with  the computer
software implementation and enhancement. These expenses continued, although at a
significantly lower level, into the fiscal year 1994. The software systems  have
been  largely operating as  designed. The Company has  not experienced any major
disruptions to its operations from the new computer software system since  early
January, 1993.

    The  decrease in  interest expense  for fiscal  1993, as  compared to fiscal
1992, was due to significantly lower interest  rates paid by the Company on  its
borrowings.  The favorable improvement in interest rates was partially offset by
higher debt levels.

INCOME TAXES

    During the  fourth quarter  of  fiscal year  1993, the  Company  implemented
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  109  covering  income  tax
accounting. The  adoption  did not  have  a  material impact  on  the  financial
statements for fiscal year 1993.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The  Company has been able to fund  its working capital requirements for the
past five years through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings.

    For the five years  ended May 31, 1994,  the Company incurred  approximately
$26 million in net aggregate capital expenditures. A significant portion of this
amount  was  incurred  for the  land,  equipment, building  improvements  and an
automated material handling  system for  its new executive  offices and  western
regional  support and distribution center. Costs  incurred to upgrade and expand
its computer system and the  acquisition and construction of several  facilities
accounted  for substantially the balance of  the capital expenditure program for
the last five years. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $9 million
for the  design, purchase  and  development of  new  computer software  for  its
operating and financial systems during fiscal years 1990 to 1993.

    The  Company's sources of liquidity at May 31, 1994 consisted principally of
working capital of $229,019,000 and unsecured bank credit lines of  $70,000,000,
of  which $30,000,000 in borrowings were  outstanding. The Company believes that
its working  capital,  borrowing  capabilities, and  the  funds  generated  from
operations   should  be  sufficient  to   finance  its  anticipated  operational
requirements.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Marshall Industries:

    We  have audited the  accompanying balance sheets  of Marshall Industries (a
California corporation) as of May 31, 1993 and 1994, and the related  statements
of  income, shareholders' investment and cash flows  for each of the three years
in  the  period  ended  May  31,  1994.  These  financial  statements  are   the
responsibility  of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all material respects,  the financial position of  Marshall Industries as of
May 31, 1993 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows  for
each  of the  three years in  the period ended  May 31, 1994  in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
May 31, 1994

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Revenue Recognition: Sales are recognized at the time of product shipment.

    Depreciation  and Amortization: Depreciation on  buildings is computed using
the straight-line method over useful lives  of 25 years. Building and  leasehold
improvements  are amortized on the straight-line  method over the shorter of the
lives of the buildings or the remaining  terms of the leases or useful lives  of
the  assets. Depreciation on  all other plant  and equipment is  computed on the
straight-line and declining  balance methods  over useful  lives of  two to  ten
years. Maintenance and repairs and minor replacements of property are charged to
expense  when incurred.  Major expenditures  for additions  and improvements are
capitalized at cost. When assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost
and related reserves are  removed from the accounts,  and any resulting gain  or
loss is included in income.

    Interest Expense: Interest income is netted against interest expense and was
not material for 1992, 1993 and 1994.

    Tax  Deferred  Profit Sharing  Plan: Under  the  provisions of  the Marshall
Industries  Tax  Deferred  Profit  Sharing  Plan  (the  "Plan"),   participating
employees  may  agree  to  defer  from  two  to  twelve  percent,  with  certain
limitations, of their earnings each payroll period, and such amount is deposited
in a nonforfeitable, fully vested trust account for the employee's benefit.  The
Company  contributes quarterly an  amount equal to 50  percent of the employees'
contributions, limited to 3% of such employee earnings for the quarter,  reduced
by  employee forfeitures  of prior Company  contributions. Company contributions
may be  limited to  the  extent of  net  profits and  must  be invested  in  the
Company's  common stock. The Plan, however, may  not own more than 20 percent of
the Company's outstanding shares. At May 31,  1994, the Plan owned less than  2%
of  the Company's outstanding shares. Company contributions and expenses related
to the Plan amounted  to $917,000 in  1992, $952,000 in  1993 and $1,125,000  in
1994.

    Capitalized  Interest: In accordance with the provisions of the Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards  No. 34,  the  Company capitalizes  interest  in
connection  with major construction projects. The Company did not have any major
construction projects requiring the capitalization of interest during 1992, 1993
and 1994.

    Income Taxes: As discussed  in Note 3, during  the fourth quarter of  fiscal
1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement
and income tax  bases of  assets and liabilities  using the  enacted tax  rates.
Prior  to the implementation of  SFAS No. 109, the  Company accounted for income
taxes using Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11.

    Cash and Accounts  Payable: The  Company's banking system  provides for  the
daily  replenishment  of  its  bank accounts  for  check  clearing requirements.
Accordingly, outstanding checks of $7,655,000  and $11,015,000 that had not  yet
been  paid by the  Company's banks at  May 31, 1993  and 1994, respectively, are
reflected in cash and accounts payable in the accompanying financial statements.

    Inventories: The Company values its inventories at the lower of average cost
or market.

    Shareholders' Investment: The  Company has authorized  200,000 shares of  no
par  value preferred  stock, of which  none was  outstanding at May  31, 1993 or
1994.

    Capitalized Deferred Software Costs: Deferred software costs are included in
other assets and  represent payments  to vendors  for the  design, purchase  and
implementation  of  the  computer  software  for  the  Company's  operating  and
financial systems. Such deferred costs aggregating to $9,259,000, are  amortized
over  five  years  beginning December,  1992.  At  May 31,  1993  and  1994, the
accumulated  amortization   of  such   costs  were   $926,000  and   $2,778,000,
respectively.

                                       17
<PAGE>

    Net  Income  Per Share:  Per  share amounts  are  computed on  the  basis of
weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (17,114,000  in
1992,  17,278,000  in 1993  and 17,357,000  in  1994). Common  equivalent shares
include the dilutive  effect of  outstanding stock options,  if applicable.  All
share  and  per share  data  included in  these  financial statements  have been
restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split paid on February 28, 1994.

(2) LONG-TERM DEBT

    Long-term debt consists of the following:

</TABLE>

Bank credit lines --

    The Company has entered into revolving credit line agreements with two major
banks to borrow up to $70,000,000 in the aggregate. These unsecured credit  line
agreements,  with borrowing  limits of up  to $40,000,000  and $30,000,000 each,
mature on December  31, 1995 and  1996, respectively. The  interest rates  under
these  credit lines are determined at the time of borrowing based on a choice of
options as specified  in the  agreements. In no  event would  the interest  rate
exceed  the prime interest  rate. At May 31,  1994, the prime  rate was 7.25%. A
commitment fee is payable based  on 1/4% per annum  on the daily average  unused
amounts  of the lines of credit. In  addition, both banks require a facility fee
of 1/8% per annum on the  commitment balance. There are no compensating  balance
requirements.

    The  terms  of  these credit  agreements  require the  Company,  among other
things, to maintain a minimum net worth of $170,000,000 which is adjusted upward
quarterly by 70 percent of  net income and 70 percent  of net proceeds from  any
sales  of capital  stock or  subordinated debentures. At  May 31,  1994 at least
$202,564,000 of shareholders' investment was required to meet this covenant. The
credit agreements also  require the  Company to meet  certain specified  working
capital and financial ratios and not to make capital expenditures or incur lease
liabilities in excess of certain specified amounts. The Company is in compliance
with all conditions and covenants of these agreements.

Industrial revenue bonds --

    The  industrial revenue bonds are  secured by real property  with a net book
value of $3,129,000 at
May 31, 1994.

                                       18
<PAGE>

Mortgages --

    These notes are secured by real property and related improvements with a net
book value of approximately $20,119,000 at May 31, 1994.

Maturities of long-term debt --

    Long-term debt  at  May  31, 1994  based  on  current terms  is  payable  in
succeeding  fiscal  years as  follows: 1995  $1,358,000; 1996  $18,710,000; 1997
$14,532,000; 1998 $1,000,000; 1999 $500,000.

    The Company's bank  credit lines  and industrial  revenue bonds  approximate
fair  value as they bear floating interest rates. The mortgages approximate fair
market value.

(3) INCOME TAXES

    The Company adopted  the provisions  of SFAS  No. 109  effective the  fourth
quarter  of fiscal year 1993.  The adoption of this  Standard, which changed the
Company's method of accounting for income  taxes from the deferred method to  an
asset  and liability approach, did  not have a material  effect on the financial
statements for fiscal year 1993.

    The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following:

</TABLE>

    The  difference between the quoted market value of the shares at the date of
grant and  the option  price for  grants made  under the  nonqualified plans  is
charged  to  income as  compensation  expense over  the  vesting periods  of the
related options. During 1992,  1993 and 1994,  $200,000, $215,000 and  $103,000,
respectively,  were charged  against income  and credited  to additional paid-in
capital under these plans. Options granted are exercisable over a period of five
to twenty years.  The income  tax effect of  any difference  between the  market
price at the grant date and the market price at the exercise date is credited to
additional paid-in capital as the options are exercised.

(6) INVESTMENT IN SONEPAR ELECTRONIQUE INTERNATIONAL

    In March, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement in principle to invest
$151  million French Francs (approximately $28  million in U.S. dollars based on
July 29, 1994 exchange rates) in Sonepar Electronique International ("SEI"), one
of  the  three  largest  electronic  component  distributors  in  Europe.   This
investment  is in the form of  an interest bearing, convertible note, guaranteed
by a major French  bank as to default.  The interest to be  charged on the  note
will be the same as the Company's borrowing rates under its unsecured term loan,
as  described herein. The note  plus accrued interest will  be converted in 1997
into a minority equity interest of up to 20% in SEI if certain anticipated sales
and pre-tax income goals are met. If  these goals are not met, the Company  will
have  the option  to call  for the  repayment in  U.S. dollar  equivalent of the
original loan (plus accrued interest) or to  convert the loan into a 20%  equity
interest  in SEI.  Following the conversion,  SEI will  have a 2  year option to
purchase an equivalent amount in U.S. dollars of the Company's stock of up to 5%
of the Company's outstanding shares on  a fully diluted basis. The option  price
will  be based  on market  prices at  the time  of conversion.  In addition, the
Company will have the option of increasing its equity investment to 49% in SEI.

    To finance its investment in SEI, the Company has obtained a commitment from
a bank for an unsecured term loan  in the amount of $25,000,000, with  principal
repayment  due on September  30, 1997. The  Company, however, has  the option of
repaying the  loan,  or a  portion  thereof, prior  to  the maturity  date.  The
interest rate on this loan will be based on 90 day LIBOR rates plus 1/2% and the
other  major terms and conditions of the  loan are comparable to the bank credit
line agreements as disclosed in Note 2.

    The Company anticipates that  its agreements with SEI  and the bank will  be
executed by August 31, 1994.

(7) BUSINESS SEGMENT

    The  Company  is  engaged  in  the  distribution  of  industrial  electronic
components and production  supplies through  a nationwide network  of sales  and
distribution  facilities. In the  opinion of management,  the Company's products
are identifiable to only one industry segment.

    The Company's Canadian operations are currently not material to its  results
of operations or financial position.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

To Marshall Industries:

    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the financial  statements  of  Marshall Industries  (a  California  corporation)
included  in this Form 10-K,  and have issued our  report thereon dated July 20,
1994. Our audits were made  for the purpose of forming  an opinion on the  basic
financial  statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed under Item 14.(a)2.
are the  responsibility  of  the  Company's management  and  are  presented  for
purposes  of complying with  the Securities and  Exchange Commission's rules and
are not  part of  the  basic financial  statements.  These schedules  have  been
subjected  to  the  auditing  procedures  applied in  the  audits  of  the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material  respects
the  financial data required  to be set  forth therein in  relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

                            CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT
                                       OF
                           ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

Robert Rodin and Henry W. Chin certify that:

1.   They are the President and Secretary, respectively, of Marshall Industries,
    a California corporation.

2.   Article FOURTH  of the  articles of  incorporation of  this corporation  is
    amended to read as follows:

           "FOURTH:  This  corporation is  authorized  to issue  two  classes of
       shares which shall  be designated 'Common  Stock' and 'Preferred  Stock'.
       The  total  number of  said  shares shall  be  forty million  two hundred
       thousand (40,200,000) shares; the aggregate par value of all shares  that
       are  to have par value shall  be Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000); the
       total number of Common  shares shall be  forty million (40,000,000),  and
       the par value of each Common share shall be One Dollar ($1.00); the total
       number  of Preferred shares shall be  two hundred thousand (200,000); all
       of said Preferred shares shall be without par value.

           The shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in  one
       or  more series. The  Board of Directors  hereby is authorized  to fix or
       alter the  dividend  rights,  dividend rate,  conversion  rights,  voting
       rights,  the  rights  and  terms of  redemption  (including  sinking fund
       provision), redemption price or prices, or the liquidation preferences of
       any wholly unissued series  of Preferred Stock, or  the number of  shares
       constituting  any unissued series of  Preferred Stock and the designation
       of such series, or all or any of them; or to increase or to decrease (but
       not below  the number  of shares  of such  series then  outstanding)  the
       number of shares constituting any outstanding series the number of shares
       of  which was fixed by the Directors. In case the number of shares of any
       series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall
       resume the  status they  had  prior to  the  adoption of  the  resolution
       originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

           Upon  the amendment of this Article Fourth to read as hereinabove set
       forth, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the close  of
       business  on  February 14,  1994, is  divided into  two shares  of Common
       Stock."

3.  The foregoing Amendment of Articles of Incorporation has been duly  approved
    by the Board of Directors.

4.   The foregoing Amendment to the  Articles of Incorporation was one which may
    be adopted  with approval  by  the Board  of  Directors alone,  pursuant  to
    Section  902(c) of the California General Corporation Law, because one class
    of shares of the Corporation is outstanding.
                                          ______________________________________
                                          Robert Rodin, President

                     NUMBERS 2-79412, 33-1587 AND 33-82510.

                                  UNDERTAKINGS

(a) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:

    (1)  To file, during any  period in which offers or  sales are being made, a
post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:

        (i) To  include  any prospectus  required  by Section  10(a)(3)  of  the
    Securities Act of 1933;

        (ii) To reflect in such prospectus any facts or events arising after the
    effective   date  of  the   Registration  Statement  (or   the  most  recent
    post-effective amendment thereof) which,  individually or in the  aggregate,
    represents  a  fundamental  change  in  the  information  set  forth  in the
    Registration Statement;

       (iii) To include  any material information  with respect to  the plan  of
    distribution  not previously disclosed in  the Registration Statement or any
    material change to such information in the Registration Statement;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that paragraphs (a)(l)(i) and (a)(l)(ii) do not apply if  the
Registration  Statement is on Form S-3 or  Form S-8 and the information required
to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in
periodic reports filed by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d)
of the Securities  Exchange Act of  1934 that are  incorporated by reference  in
this Registration Statement.

    (2)  That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities
Act of 1933,  each such post-effective  amendment shall  be deemed to  be a  new
Registration  Statement  relating to  the  securities offered  therein,  and the
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial  bona
fide offering thereof.

    (3)  To remove from registration by  means of a post-effective amendment any
of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
offering.

(b)  The  undersigned  Registrant  hereby  undertakes  that,  for  purposes   of
determining  any liability under the Securities Act  of 1933, each filing of the
Registrant's annual report  pursuant to Section  13(a) or Section  15(d) of  the
Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934  (and, where  applicable,  each filing  of an
employee  benefit  plan's  annual  report  pursuant  to  Section  15(d)  of  the
Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934)  that is  incorporated  by reference  in the
Registration Statement  shall  be deemed  to  be a  new  Registration  Statement
relating  to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(f) EMPLOYEE PLANS ON FORM S-8.

    (1) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes  to deliver or cause to  be
delivered with the prospectus to each employee to whom the prospectus is sent or
given  a copy  of the  registrant's annual report  to stockholders  for its last
fiscal year, unless such employee otherwise has received a copy of such  report,
in which case the Registrant shall state in the prospectus that it will promptly
furnish,  without  charge, a  copy  of such  report  on written  request  of the
employee. If the  last fiscal year  of the  Registrant has ended  with 120  days
prior  to the use of the prospectus, the annual report of the Registrant for the
preceding fiscal year may be  so delivered, but within  such 120 day period  the
annual report for the last fiscal year will be furnished to each such employee.

    (2)  The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to transmit or cause to be
transmitted to all  employees participating  in the  Plan who  do not  otherwise
receive  such material as stockholders of the registrant, at the time and in the
manner such material is sent to  its stockholders, copies of all reports,  proxy
statements and other communications distributed to its stockholders generally.

(i)  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to  directors, officers and controlling persons of  the
Registrant  pursuant to the  foregoing provisions, or  otherwise, the Registrant
has been advised that in the  opinion of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
such  indemnification is against  public policy as  expressed in the  Act and is
therefore unenforceable. In the event  that a claim for indemnification  against
such  liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director,  officer or controlling person  of the Registrant in  the
successful  defense  of any  action,  suit or  proceeding)  is asserted  by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities  being
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has  been settled  by controlling  precedent, submit  to a  court of appropriate
jurisdiction the  question of  whether  such indemnification  by it  is  against
public  policy  as  expressed in  the  Act and  will  be governed  by  the final
adjudication of such issue.
