                                    PART I.
Item 1.           Business.

                  American Southwest Financial Corporation (the "Company") was
organized for the purpose of issuing mortgage- collateralized bonds ("Bonds")
in series ("Series") consisting of one or more classes (each a "Class") to
facilitate the financing of long-term residential mortgage loans secured by
single-family residences and is not permitted to engage in any business or
investment activities other than those described in its Articles of
Incorporation.  Article III of the Company's Articles of Incorporation limits
the Company's business to the issuance of Bonds secured by mortgage collateral
which may include Government National Mortgage Association Certificates,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Certificates, Federal National Mortgage
Association Certificates, pledged loans, mortgage pass-through certificates and
mortgage collateralized obligations issued by any person or entity or other
interests in mortgages, and to the extent any such mortgage collateral
represents an interest in or is secured by mortgage loans, such mortgage loans;
to hold, transfer, assign, pledge, finance and otherwise deal with such
mortgage collateral; to loan the proceeds from the sale of Bonds for use in
connection with the funding or acquisition of such mortgage collateral; and to
conduct activities incidental and necessary for such purposes.  Article XII of
the Company's Articles of Incorporation prohibits the Company, without the
prior written consent of the trustee under each indenture to which it is a
party, from (i) engaging in any business or activity other than in 
connection with or relating to the issuance of Bonds secured by mortgage 
collateral, (ii) incurring, assuming or guaranteeing any indebtedness of 
any entity, except for such indebtedness as may be incurred by the Company 
in connection with the issuance of Bonds by the Company secured by mortgage 
collateral and rated in one of the two highest rating categories by





                                       2
<PAGE>   3
at least one nationally recognized rating agency, (iii) incurring, assuming or
guaranteeing any indebtedness of any entity other than in connection with the
issuance of Bonds by the Company secured by mortgage collateral, unless such
indebtedness is completely subordinated to the indebtedness evidenced by such
Bonds, (iv) merging or consolidating with another corporation unless the
Company's successor shall expressly assume the Company's obligations under any
indenture to which the Company is a party, or (v) amending Articles III or XII
of the Company's Articles of Incorporation.
                  
     As a result of changes in the mortgage securitization
industry including, among other factors, changes in federal and state tax laws
during 1986 and 1987, the creation of real estate mortgage investment conduits
("REMICs") in 1987 and the emergence of FNMA and FHLMC as the largest domestic
issuers of mortgage-collateralized securities, the Company has not issued any
mortgage- collateralized Bonds since September 29, 1988.  Currently, the
Company earns substantially all of its net income from redemptions of its
outstanding Bonds and from other interest income.  In the event the Company
does not issue Bonds in the future or does not earn significant redemption
income due to changes in interest rates which reduce opportunities for
profitable redemptions or there are significant reductions in the amount of
outstanding Bonds, the Company may sustain losses.  See the Financial
Statements included as part of Item 8 of this Report for information with
respect to the amounts of revenue, operating profits and identifiable assets 
including the outstanding principal balance of Bonds at June 30, 1994.
  
     The Company and American Southwest Financial Services, Inc. ("ASFS"), an 
affiliate of the Company, are parties to an agreement (the "Mortgage 
Securities Issuance and Administration Agreement") dated as of 
January 1, 1988, and amended on May 13, 1992, pursuant to which ASFS provides 
various services





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
in connection with the issuance and administration of each Series of Bonds
issued  by the Company.  The Mortgage Securities Issuance and Administration
Agreement generally provides for the Company to pay ASFS, on a quarterly basis,
the shortfall between the total fees earned by ASFS for both the securities
issuance services and the securities administration services it performs and
110% of the overhead of ASFS, subject to scheduled adjustments.

     The Mortgage Securities Issuance and Administration Agreement
may be terminated by either party upon three months' prior written notice to
the other party, except that ASFS may not terminate securities administration
services provided as to any Series of Bonds which has closed prior to the date
of termination without the consent of the Company.  

Item 2. Properties.

        None.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

        None.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

        The annual meeting of shareholders of the Company was held on
May 16, 1994.  The Class A voting shareholders elected the Board of Directors
of the Company by unanimous vote for the ensuing year or until their successors
are elected and have qualified.  The names of the Directors elected at the 
meeting are as follows:

                       Jon A. Grove               Alan D. Hamberlin
                       G. Thomas Eggebrecht       Kirby Korth 
                       Philip J. Polich           Michael H. Feinstein
                       J. Larry Sorsby

Item 5.   Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.
       
          There is no trading market for the Company's common stock.  
At September 15, 1994, there were 18 Class A and 37 Class B shareholders 
of common stock.  The Company has never paid a dividend on its common stock.  
The Company's Articles of Incorporation provide that only the holders of 
Class A stock are entitled to receive dividends.  

Item 6.    Selected Financial Data.

           The data presented herein is for the Company's last five
fiscal years ending June 30.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
          Results of Operations.                             
                      
          The Company was organized for the purpose of issuing various 
Series of Bonds to facilitate the financing of long-term residential 
mortgage loans secured by single-family residences.  The Company does 
not have and is not expected to have any significant assets other than 
cash and the assets pledged to secure specific Series of Bonds.  On the
closing of a Series of Bonds issued by the Company,  the Company applies the
net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds toward the simultaneous purchase
or the repayment of indebtedness with respect to the mortgage collateral
("Mortgage Collateral") securing such Series of Bonds or to fund loans to
participating finance companies ("Finance Companies") pursuant to funding
agreements ("Funding Agreements").  See Note 2 of the Financial Statements
included in this Report.  The Company last issued a Series of Bonds



                                       6
<PAGE>   7
in September 1988.  Issuance fees charged for each Series of Bonds issued by the
Company are used to pay Bond offering expenses.

     Each Series of Bonds that has been issued is a nonrecourse obligation of 
the Company, payable solely form the Mortgage Collateral and other collateral 
(togehter the "Collateral") pledged to secure such Series of Bonds.  Neither 
the Company nor the Finance Companies guarantee or are obligated to pay the 
Bonds of a Series except from the proceeds of the Collateral securing such 
Series of Bonds. The Company has made elections to treat the arrangements by 
which the Collateral securing certain Series of Bonds is held as REMICs for 
federal income tax purposes.

Results of Operations
            
     The Company's net income for the fiscal years ended June 30,1994, 1993
and 1992 was $2,180,855 ($117.88 per share), $209,410 ($9.91 per share) and 
$3,124,042 ($127.69 per share), respectively.  The Company's net income for 
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 primarily resulted from redemption income 
and other interest income.

     The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest pursuant to
Funding Agreements and interest from Mortgage Securities, the total of which
are substantially offset by interest expense on Bonds.  See Note 2 of the
accompanying Financial Statements.  This interest income and related interest
expense has declined over the last three fiscal years due to (i) regular
payments and prepayments on the Mortgage Collateral securing the various 
series of Bonds, (ii) the sale of Mortgage Collateral in conjunction with Bond
redemptions and (iii) the time-out calls (defined below) on certain Classes of
Bonds.  These same factors also caused reductions in the outstanding amounts of
Collateral and Bonds.



                                       7
<PAGE>   8

                  The Company anticipates that its interest income and related
interest expense will continue to decline due to future redemptions, time-out
calls and the fact that the Company has not issued a new Series of Bonds since
1988.
                  Other interest income consists primarily of (i) interest
earned on the reinvestment of the monthly payments on the Collateral (for
certain non-REMIC Series of Bonds issued by the Company) prior to the assumed
deposit date for such Series as defined in the related indenture supplements
(the "Series Supplements") and (ii) to a much lesser degree, interest earned
from investing the Company's cash.  Other interest income is lower in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 as compared to the fiscal years ended June 30,
1993 and 1992 primarily due to the reductions of Collateral securing the
Company's non-REMIC Bonds earning reinvestment income.  In the long-term, other
interest income attributable to reinvested payments is expected to continue to
decrease since the Collateral securing the Company's non-REMIC Bonds is reduced
over time and the amount of the monthly payments on the Collateral which may be
reinvested by the trustee the ("Trustee") prior to the assumed deposit date
also will decrease.  It is not likely the collateral will increase since the
Company is not likely to issue additional non-REMIC Series of Bonds as a result
of changes in the Internal Revenue Code.

                  The Company derives management fee revenue from fees charged
to the Finance Companies for management of current Bond administration funds.
Fees vary depending on investment returns on these funds held by the Company
specifically for payment of current Bond administration expenses.  At the time
of a full redemption of a Series of Bonds (see below), excess current Bond
administration funds are returned to the Finance Companies. This reduction of
funds, and to a lesser extent the current short-term interest rate environment, 
accounts for

                                      8
<PAGE>   9

the reduced management fee revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 as
compared to the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992.  Current Bond
administration funds are a portion of funds ("Escrowed Reserve Funds")
administered and invested on behalf of the Finance Companies by the Company.
See Note 8 of the Financial Statements included in this Report.

                  The Series Supplements relating to certain Series of Bonds
issued by the Company contain redemption provisions which give the Company the
option to redeem such Bonds in whole or in part when specific criteria are met.
With respect to other Series of Bonds, the Company may effect a redemption only
at the direction of the holder of the residual interest.  The following table
sets forth certain information with respect to redemptions by the Company of
various Series of Bonds or Classes of Bonds during the fiscal year ended June
30, 1994:

                  At the time of a redemption, with the Company's and Trustee's
consent, the underlying collateral is sold and the proceeds from the sale are
used to redeem the Bonds.  The Company remits the remainder either to (i) the
participating Finance Companies after charging each a prepayment fee (included
in redemption and modification income) or (ii) to the holder of the residual
interest in the REMIC, as applicable.   Prepayment fees received from the
Finance Companies in connection with redemptions during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1994 were $4,098,297 as compared to $1,852,453 for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1993 and $843,176 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.

                  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, a certain Finance
Company elected not to sell its collateral and participate in certain
redemptions.  The Company nevertheless effected the full redemption of these
related Series of Bonds, and utilized corporate cash to redeem the
non-participating Finance Company's proportionate share of the Bonds.
Subsequent to these redemptions the Company earns all interest income and
receives all principal payments on funding notes owed by the non-participating
Finance Company without offsetting liabilities on the Bonds.

                 Additionally, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994,
1993 and 1992, the Company exercised its rights (pursuant to the indenture and 
the applicable Series Supplements) to effect the optional Class redemptions
(known as "time-out calls") of the remaining outstanding amounts of certain
Classes of Bonds, utilizing corporate cash, Escrowed Reserve Funds and funds
borrowed from affiliates.  Pursuant to the time-out calls, payments of
principal and interest that would otherwise be payable to the holders of Bonds
so redeemed are paid by the Trustee to the Company.  During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1994, the Company borrowed funds from affiliates to effect
certain time-out calls, and paid

                                      10
<PAGE>   11

interest to such affiliates at the prime rate of interest as published in the
Wall Street Journal.  All borrowings from affiliates for time-out calls had
been repaid at June 30, 1994.  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and
1992, to the extent Escrowed Reserve Funds were utilized to effect the time-out
calls, the Company credited all principal and interest (presented as interest
on other obligations) to the Escrowed Reserve Funds.  At June 30, 1994, the
Company had invested $2,076,963 of corporate cash in outstanding time-out calls
with a weighted average yield of 9.25% compared to $823,143 with a weighted
average yield of 8.75% at June 30, 1993.  Interest expense on Bonds is less
than interest income related to Funding Agreements and Mortgage Securities for
the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 due to these time-out calls
and due to the Funding Agreements that remained in place after certain
redemptions of Series of Bonds in the 1994 fiscal year.

                  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company and
the Trustee, in agreement with Bondholders and pursuant to the indenture and as
supplemented by the applicable Series Supplements, modified the redemption
rights of the Series H Class H-4 Bonds, the Series I Class I-3 Bonds, the
Series J Class J-3 Bonds and the Series K Class K-3 Bonds through amendments of
the applicable Series Supplements.  The Company earned $5,170,709 from these
modifications which is included in redemption and modification income for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  The Company also modified the redemption
rights for the Series G Class G-4 Bonds in May 1991.  The Company did not 
modify the redemption rights relating to any Series of Bonds during the 
fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993.

                  Although redemption and modification opportunities were
favorable in the past few years, the benefits of redemptions and modifications
are not predictable




                                       11
<PAGE>   12

and may not be favorable in the future due to a variety of factors including
uncertainty of the time at which the Company may effect redemptions or
modifications of the outstanding Bonds, prevailing interest rates, other
similar market factors and, in certain circumstances, limitations under
agreements entered into by the Company.

                  The amount of interest income received on the Collateral
securing the various Series of Bonds issued by the Company, the rate at which
principal prepayments are made on such Collateral, the amount of other interest
income earned from the reinvestment of monthly payments on such Collateral, the
amount of other interest income earned on the Company's corporate cash, the
interest rates payable by the Company on certain Classes of Bonds issued by it,
and the amounts ("Surplus") distributed to the Finance Companies or to the
holders of the residual interests in the REMICs depend upon prevailing interest
rates and are significantly affected by interest rate fluctuations.  However,
since Surplus (generally, the right to receive the remaining cash flow
available on Collateral after debt service and payment of administrative
expenses on Bonds) is payable to the Finance Companies or to the holders of the
residual interests in the REMICs, the risks associated with fluctuations in
interest rates are borne primarily by the Finance Companies and the holders of
the residual interests in the REMICs rather than by the Company.

                   Primary expenditures of the Company consist of management
fees paid to ASFS, professional fees, interest on other obligations and
interest paid to affiliates.  The Company receives the use of office space,
equipment, and certain managerial, administrative, financial and other services
pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Securities Issuance and Administration
Agreement between the Company and ASFS.  The Mortgage Securities Issuance and
Administration Agreement




                                       12
<PAGE>   13
generally provides for the Company to pay ASFS management fees for certain
services it performs (see Item 1 of this Report).  Management fees increased in
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 as compared to the fiscal year ended June
30, 1993 but decreased as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.
These variances are a function of the operating overhead of ASFS, offset by
issuance fees and other revenues earned by ASFS, both of which directly affect
the amount of management fees as explained in Item 1 of this Report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

                  At June 30, 1994, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
of $1,434,442 as compared to $3,989,969 at June 30, 1993.  The Company had
$2,076,963 and $2,221,452 invested in time-out calls and funding notes,
respectively, at June 30, 1994 as compared to $823,143 invested in time-out
calls and no funding notes at June 30, 1993.  Funds used for time-out calls and
funding notes earned interest at rates ranging from 8.75% to 10.2% per annum
for various periods of time during the current fiscal year.
          
                  The Company believes that scheduled payments of principal and
interest on the Collateral pledged to secure each Series of Bonds, together
with amounts available from reserve funds established for such Bonds and any
reinvestment income on such amounts, will provide sufficient funds (i) to pay
principal and interest on such Bonds when due and to retire such Bonds not
later than their respective stated maturities and (ii) to pay related Bond
administration expenses.

     The Company anticipates that funds to meet its current and future 
operating needs will be provided from current cash and future operations.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations (cont'd).

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

                  The primary revenue producing activities of the Company
(issuance, redemptions and modifications) are all impacted by interest rates,
which in turn are affected by numerous factors.  These factors include
conditions in financial markets, the fiscal and monetary policies of the United
States government and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
international economic and financial conditions and other factors, none of
which can be predicted with any certainty.

                  Virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the Company
are monetary in nature.  As a result, interest rates have a more significant
impact on the performance of the Company than the effects of general levels of
inflation since changes in prevailing interest rates will affect the
availability, cost and expected maturity of Collateral.  This in turn will
affect the Company's ability to issue new Series of Bonds and earn new fees.
Changes in interest rates (particularly long-term interest rates) also affect
the timing and profit potential of Bond redemptions and Bond modifications,
with lower rates being a positive factor and higher rates being a negative
factor.  Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the
same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are
affected by inflation while interest rates generally are not affected to the
same degree.  Nevertheless, neither changes in interest rates nor inflationary
pressures are expected to significantly affect the ability of the Company to
meet its obligations as they become due because (i) each Series of Bonds is
secured by Collateral paying interest at fixed rates, and (ii) interest on each
Class of Bonds is paid at fixed rates, or at rates based on specified formulas
subject to specific maximum limitations.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                             JUNE 30, 1994 AND 1993

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS

Organization

         American Southwest Financial Corporation (the "Company") was
organized for the purpose of issuing mortgage- collateralized bonds ("Bonds")
in series ("Series") consisting of one or more classes (each a "Class") to
facilitate the financing of long-term residential mortgage loans secured by
single-family residences.  The Company last issued a Series of Bonds in
September 1988.  The Bonds are collateralized by certificates of the Government
National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association and
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (collectively, all such certificates
are referred to as "Mortgage Certificates") and by conventional mortgage loans
(together with Mortgage Certificates referred to as "Mortgage Collateral").
The Company does not have and is not expected to have any significant assets
other than cash and the assets pledged to secure specific Series of Bonds.

         Each Series of Bonds that has been issued is a nonrecourse obligation 
of the Company payable solely from the Mortgage Collateral and other collateral 
(together the "Collateral") pledged to secure such Series of Bonds.  Neither 
the Company, the participating finance companies ("Finance Companies") nor the 
holders of the residual interest in the REMICs (defined below), as applicable, 
have guaranteed, or otherwise are obligated to pay the Bonds of a Series except 
from the proceeds of the Collateral securing such Series of Bonds.  The Company 
has made elections to treat the arrangements by which the Collateral securing 
certain Series of Bonds is held as "real estate mortgage investment conduits" 
("REMICs") for federal income tax purposes.  The residual interests in the 
REMICs (generally, the right to receive the remaining cash flow available on 
Collateral



                                       22
<PAGE>   23
after debt service and payment of administrative expenses on Bonds) are owned
by persons other than the Company.  

Discounts on Receivables Pursuant to Funding Agreements, Mortgage Securities 
and Bonds

         Discounts incurred in connection with the issuance of Bonds and the 
acquisition of related Collateral are amortized using the interest method over 
the estimated life of the Bonds.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments approximates 
fair value.  

NOTE 2 - MORTGAGE COLLATERAL AND BONDS PAYABLE

         As a result of the elections by the Company to treat the arrangement 
by which the Collateral securing certain Series of Bonds is held as REMICs, the 
related income and expense of each such Series is reported as a separate entity 
for federal income tax purposes.  For financial statement purposes, the 
Mortgage Collateral securing the Bonds of a Series is presented on the balance 
sheets as (i) "Receivables Pursuant to Funding Agreements" (defined below) if 
the Mortgage Collateral securing such Series is owned by Finance Companies and 
pledged by such Finance Companies to the Company pursuant to funding 
agreements, or (ii) "Mortgage Securities" if the Mortgage Collateral securing 
such Series is owned by the Company.  The Bonds secured by the Mortgage 
Collateral are presented as "Bonds Payable".

         With respect to a Series of Bonds for which the Mortgage Collateral 
securing such Series is owned by the Finance Companies and pledged to the 
Company, the Company and each Finance Company participating in such Series 
enter



                                        23
<PAGE>   24
into a funding agreement ("Funding Agreement") with respect to such Series
pursuant to which the Company lends and such Finance Company borrows all or a
portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds of such Series.  Each
participating Finance Company agrees to repay its loan from the Company by
causing payments to be made to the trustee (the "Trustee") for the related
Series of Bonds on behalf of the Company in such amounts as are necessary to
pay the principal of and interest on the Finance Company's loan from the
Company as it becomes due, and each Finance Company pledges to the Company
Collateral as security for its loan.  The Company assigns to the Trustee its
entire right, title and interest in the Collateral and all proceeds thereof
pledged under the Funding Agreements as security for such Series of Bonds.  At
June 30, 1994, the Company had $2,221,452 in Receivables Pursuant to Funding
Agreements that were not pledged as security for Series of Bonds, having paid
off the related Series of Bonds utilizing corporate cash.  At June 30, 1994 and
1993, various funds held by the Trustee pursuant to Funding Agreements such as
expense reserve funds and debt service funds together with deposits of funds
received from payments on Mortgage Collateral, were approximately $40,850,000
and $111,526,000, respectively.
                  
     Payments on the Mortgage Collateral and withdrawals from the
debt service funds are the sources of funds for payments of principal and
interest on the Bonds.  Each Mortgage Certificate and mortgage loan is assigned
an initial funding amount which in the aggregate is at least equal to the 
principal amount of the Bonds at the issue date.  The interest rates and 
stated maturities for the Mortgage Collateral are similar to the Bonds Payable.




                                      24
<PAGE>   25
         Funds generated by principal and interest payments on the Mortgage 
Collateral securing a Series of Bonds are held by the Trustee.  If Bonds are 
outstanding, the Trustee holds the funds until the payment dates for the Bonds 
of such Series, makes the payments to the bondholders and remits the surplus 
cash to the Company.  The surplus is used to pay current fees and expenses, 
held in reserve funds for future fees and expenses, held in special reserve 
funds securing the Bonds, paid to the Finance Companies pursuant to the Funding 
Agreements, if any, or paid to the purchaser of the residual interest in the 
REMIC, if any, with respect to such Series.

         In the case where the Company has paid off the Bonds of a Series and 
has retained the Receivable Pursuant to Funding Agreements, the Trustee, 
through a separate custodial agreement, acts only as a custodian of the 
principal and interest payments on the Mortgage Collateral and remits the
entire amount to the Company monthly.  The Company, in turn, holds these funds
as escrowed reserve funds (see Note 8) and applies the funds to principal and
interest payments on the Finance Company's Funding Agreements as they become
due and pays administration costs.  The Company periodically remits any surplus
funds to the Finance Company pursuant to the Funding Agreements.

         As of June 30, 1994, the Company had issued 68 Series of Bonds, of 
which 37 Series were outstanding with stated maturities ranging from years 
2004 through 2019.  The Bonds that bear interest at fixed rates have rates 
ranging from 7.50% to 12.50%.  Certain Classes of Bonds bear interest at 
variable rates, determined monthly or quarterly, equal to a stated percentage 
above either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or (ii) the Cost of 
Funds Index (COFI), subject,  in each case, to a maximum interest rate ceiling 
established at the issuance




                                      25
<PAGE>   26
date.  Certain Classes of Bonds are entitled to receive principal payments only
and do not bear interest.  

         Under the applicable indenture supplements (the "Series Supplements"), 
the unpaid principal balances of certain Classes of "compound interest" Bonds 
are increased by the amount of interest accrued but not yet payable on each 
payment date.  The amount of principal to be paid at each payment date is 
based on the distributions received from the Collateral since the prior 
payment date.  Interest rates on mortgage loans underlying the Mortgage 
Collateral pledged to secure the Bonds affect the rate of repayment on 
the Mortgage Collateral and the timing of the return of principal to the 
Bondholders.  The following table demonstrates the Bond principal 
reduction experienced by the Company:

         The Series Supplements relating to certain Series of Bonds
issued by the Company contain redemption provisions which give the Company the
option to redeem such Bonds in whole or in part when specific criteria are met.
With respect to



                                       26
<PAGE>   27
other Series of Bonds, the Company may effect a redemption only at the
direction of the holders of the residual interest.  The Company exercised the
right to redeem the outstanding Bonds (or portions of the outstanding Bonds) of
numerous Series during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  At
the time of a redemption, with the Company's and Trustee's consent, the
underlying collateral is sold and the proceeds from the sale are used to redeem
the Bonds.  The Company remits the remainder, if any, either to (i) the
participating Finance Companies after charging each a prepayment fee (included
in redemption and modification income) or (ii) to the holder of the residual
interest in the REMIC, as applicable.  During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1994, a certain Finance Company elected not to sell its collateral and
participate in certain redemptions.  The Company nevertheless effected the full
redemption of these related Series of Bonds, and utilized corporate cash to
redeem the non-participating Finance Company's proportionate share of the
Bonds.  Prepayment fees charged to the Finance Companies which elected to sell
their collateral, including fees charged to affiliates, are assessed in
accordance with specific policies established by the Company.  Any deviation
from these policies necessary to address unique Bond structures, Collateral  or
other factors requires approval of the Company's Board of Directors including a
majority of the Directors who have no financial or other interest in the
matter.  Expenses related to the redemptions are included in other expenses.  
Although redemption opportunities were favorable in the past few years, 
the benefits of redemptions are not predictable and may not be favorable 
in the future due to a variety of factors including uncertainty of the 
time at which the Company may effect redemptions of the outstanding Bonds, 
prevailing interest rates, other similar market factors


                                     27   
<PAGE>   28
and, in certain circumstances, limitations under agreements entered into by the
Company.  

         Additionally, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 
1992, the Company exercised its right (pursuant to the indenture and the 
applicable Series Supplements) to effect the
optional Class redemptions (known as "time-out calls") of the remaining
outstanding amounts of certain Classes of Bonds, utilizing corporate cash,
Escrowed Reserve Funds (Note 8) and funds borrowed from affiliates.  Pursuant
to the time-out calls, payments of principal and interest that would otherwise
be payable to the holders of Bonds so redeemed are paid by the Trustee to the
Company.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the Company borrowed
funds from affiliates to effect certain time-out calls, paying interest to such
affiliates at the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street
Journal.  All borrowings from affiliates for time-out calls had been repaid at
June 30, 1994.  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, to the
extent Escrowed Reserve Funds were utilized to effect the time- out calls, the
Company credited all principal and interest (presented as interest on other
obligations) to the Escrowed Reserve Funds.  Interest expense on Bonds is less
than interest income related to Funding Agreements and Mortgage Securities due
to these time-out calls and due to the Funding Agreements that remained in
place after certain redemptions of Series of Bonds in the 1994 fiscal year.

NOTE 3 - BOND MODIFICATIONS

         During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company and
the Trustee, in agreement with Bondholders and pursuant to the indenture and as
supplemented by the applicable Series Supplements, modified the redemption
rights of the


                                      28
<PAGE>   29
Series H Class H-4 Bonds, the Series I Class I-3 Bonds, the Series J Class J-3
Bonds and the Series K Class K-3 Bonds through amendments of the applicable
Series Supplements.  In connection with these modifications, the Company
recorded income of $5,170,709 which is included in redemption and modification
income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  The Company also modified the
redemption rights for the Series G Class G-4 Bonds in May 1991.  The Company
did not modify the redemption rights relating to any Series of Bonds during the
fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993.  

NOTE 4 - TREASURY STOCK
                  
         The Company acquired 1,000 shares of Class A Common Stock
from one shareholder during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.  During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, the Company acquired from three shareholders a
total of 3,000 shares of Class A Common Stock.  During the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1992, the Company acquired from eight shareholders a total of 8,000
shares of Class A Common Stock and sold a total of 6,000 Class A shares at cost
to Directors.  In each case, the shareholder who sold the shares to the Company
simultaneously sold to two affiliates of the Company, the shareholder's shares
in such affiliates.  The total purchase price for the shares of all three
companies, in each case, was allocated to the shares based on the relative book
value of the companies on the date of the purchase.  The Company also acquired
1,000 shares of Class B Common Stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994;
acquired and subsequently retired 1,000 shares of Class B Common Stock during 
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993; and utilized the cost method of accounting 
in all cases for the acquisitions of the Class A and Class B shares.

NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Company receives the use of office space, equipment, and
certain managerial, administrative, financial and other services from an
affiliate, American Southwest Financial Services, Inc. ("ASFS") pursuant to the
terms of an agreement (the "Mortgage Securities Issuance and Administration
Agreement") between the Company and ASFS.  The Mortgage Securities Issuance and
Administration Agreement generally provides for the Company to pay ASFS, on a
quarterly basis, the shortfall between the total fees earned for both the
securities issuance services and the securities administration services ASFS
performs, and 110% of the overhead of ASFS, subject to scheduled adjustments.
Management fees payable to ASFS at June 30, 1994 and 1993 are $225,000 and
$400,000, respectively, and are included in payable to affiliates.  For each
outstanding Series of Bonds, ASFS also receives administration fees which are
paid from the cash held as Escrowed Reserve Funds or by the Trustee and are not
expenses of the Company.  The holders of Class A Stock of the Company and of
American Southwest Finance Co., Inc. ("ASFCI"), an affiliate, own 100% of the
Class A Stock of American Southwest Affiliated Companies ("ASAC"), parent
company of ASFS and various other affiliates.

         During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
the net assets of certain Finance Companies were acquired by subsidiaries of
ASAC.

         Additionally, the Company made advances to ASAC during the
fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  The advances were collectible
upon demand and the amounts presented on the balance sheets include interest

respectively, and is included in other interest income.  Subsequent to June 30,
1994, the advances were paid in full with interest.

         During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
certain Finance Companies, including subsidiaries of ASAC, sold portfolios of
single-family mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans") at their cost to SecurNet
Financial Corporation ("SecurNet", a subsidiary of ASAC) in connection with
certain Bond redemptions.  To effect the purchases, SecurNet borrowed funds
from the Escrowed Reserve Funds administered by the Company, or arranged
financing through an outside source.  SecurNet's borrowings from the Escrowed
Reserve Funds were evidenced by a note, the principal amount of which was not
to exceed $8 million, collectible upon demand, secured by the Mortgage Loans
and bearing interest at prime, which was 7.25% and 6% at June 30, 1994 and
1993, respectively.  At June 30, 1994, the balance of the Mortgage Loans with
accrued interest was $6,320,484 while SecurNet owed $5,220,169 to the Escrowed
Reserve Funds, including accrued interest.  On August 11, 1994, SecurNet repaid
in full the note and interest to the Escrowed Reserve Funds.

         In July 1994, the Company entered into a Letter of
Understanding with one of its Class A shareholders pursuant to which the
Company, ASFCI and ASAC each agreed to purchase, upon such shareholder's
request made at any time prior to December 1, 1994 all of such shareholder's 
shares of Class A stock in the Company, ASFCI and ASAC (or any stock issued in 
exchange for such stock) at a price equal to the higher of (i) $1,000,000 or, 
(ii) in the event the Company has purchased Class A stock from another 
shareholder prior to December 1, 1994 at a purchase price higher than 
$1,000,000, such higher price.

         In September 1993 the Company and a Finance Company sold the
Collateral securing its Series 45 Bonds, paid the Bondholders all principal and
interest due on the redemption date and collected a negotiated prepayment
penalty.  A Director of the Company also serves as a Director and President of
the residual holder.

         In December 1992, the Company and another Finance Company
(the "Seller") that participated in various Series of Bonds of the Company
entered into an agreement under which the Company acquired and placed into
Treasury Stock all shares of stock of the Company owned by the Seller.  They
also agreed to maintain at the current amounts the Bond Administration Fees
charged by the Company to the Seller for the various Series of Bonds in which
the Seller participated.  As part of the agreement, an affiliate of the Company
(a subsidiary of ASAC), concurrently purchased all of the assets of two Finance
Companies (affiliates of the Seller) that were participants in the Company's
Series W and Series 38 Bonds.  The Collateral relating to Series W was sold in
December 1992; the Bonds were subsequently redeemed in February 1993; and all
benefits from the transaction were paid to the subsidiary of ASAC.  Surplus
relating to Series 38 continues to be paid to the subsidiary of ASAC.  Another
Director of the Company also served as an Officer of the Seller at the time of
the transaction.

Reserve Funds are discussed in Notes 2 and 8.

Companies pursuant to full redemptions of Bonds.  The Company believes that the

administration obligations, including the obligation to ASFS under the Mortgage
Securities Issuance and Administration Agreement.

               On January 1, 1986, ASFS established an Internal Revenue
Service Section 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the "401(k) Plan").
Employees become eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan after 500 hours of
service.  401(k) Plan participants make pretax contributions based on their
level of compensation to total compensation paid, subject to IRS maximums.
ASFS contributes matching contributions at a percentage determined from time to

to such match.  For the calendar year ended December 31, 1993, ASFS contributed
$91,048 to the 401(k) Plan and for the current calendar year ASFS has
contributed $65,033 through June 30, 1994.

effective July 1, 1993, which superseded the previous three year employment
agreement entered into as of January 1, 1991.  The new agreement called for

Mr. Eggebrecht's death or disability, breach of the agreement or acts involving
a crime, moral turpitude, fraud or dishonesty.  In addition, either party at
its option may terminate Mr. Eggebrecht's employment upon notice to the other
party.  In August 1994, pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement the
Board of Directors of ASAC terminated Mr. Eggebrecht's employment.

ASFS) receive annual fees paid by ASFS of $25,000 and $500 for each meeting
attended including committee meetings.  Directors who are officers of the
Company did not receive this compensation after July 1, 1993.

                  The members of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors are Jon A. Grove, Philip J. Polich and J.  Larry Sorsby.  Mr. Grove

ASFS and SecurNet Financial Corporation ("SecurNet"), parent company of
SecurNet I and SMSCII, as well as various other affiliates.

                  The Company is a party to the Mortgage Securities Issuance
and Administration Agreement with ASFS.  The Mortgage Securities Issuance and
Administration Agreement generally provides for the Company to pay ASFS, on a
quarterly basis, the shortfall between the total fees earned for both the
securities issuance services and the securities administration services ASFS
performs, and 110% of the overhead of ASFS, subject to scheduled adjustments.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the Company paid or accrued $1,825,000
to ASFS pursuant to the Mortgage Securities Issuance and Administration
Agreement.

                  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
certain Finance Companies sold portfolios of single- family mortgage loans at
cost to SecurNet.  To effect such purchases, SecurNet borrowed funds from the
Escrowed Reserve Funds pursuant to a signed note, or arranged financing through
an outside source.  Reference is made to Note 5 of the Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Report for a more detailed description of these
transactions.

                  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
the Company advanced funds to ASAC for various corporate purposes.  All funds
advanced to ASAC bore interest at the prime rate of interest as published in
the Wall Street Journal.  At June 30, 1994, the outstanding amount was
$1,750,000, which has subsequently been paid in full with interest.  At June
30, 1993 the outstanding amount was $660,000.  

                  Subsequent to June 30, 1994 the Company borrowed $2,245,000 
from ASAC pursuant to a signed note.  See Note 9 ofthe Financial Statements 
included in Item 8 of this report.

                  In July 1994, the Company entered into a Letter of
Understanding with one of its Class A shareholders pursuant to which the
Company, ASFCI and ASAC each agreed to purchase, upon such shareholder's
request made at any time prior to


                                       47
<PAGE>   48


December 1, 1994 all of such shareholder's shares of Class A stock in the
Company, ASFCI and ASAC (or any stock issued in exchange for such stock) at a
price equal to the higher of (i) $1,000,000 or, (ii) in the event the Company
has purchased Class A stock from another shareholder prior to December 1, 1994
at a purchase price higher than $1,000,000, such higher price.

                  Pursuant to various Conditional Subscription Agreements, as
amended, between various shareholders of Class A stock of the Company and
American Southwest Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), an Arizona corporation, in the
event that at least 80% of such Class A shareholders execute such amended
Conditional Subscription Agreements, such shareholders will exchange their
shares of Class A stock in each of the Company, ASFCI and ASAC for shares of
stock in Holdings.  Upon the exchange of shares, such Class A shareholders will
become the sole shareholders of Holdings and Holdings will own the shares of
Class A stock in the Company, ASFCI and ASAC previously owned by such
shareholders.  As of September 23, 1994, 11 Class A shareholders had executed
and delivered the amended Conditional Subscription Agreement.

                  In September 1993 the Company and a Finance Company sold the
Collateral securing its Series 45 Bonds, paid the Bondholders all principal and
interest due on the redemption date and collected a negotiated prepayment
penalty.  A Director of the Company also serves as a Director and President of
the residual holder.

                  In December 1992, the Company and another Finance Company
(the "Seller") that participated in various Series of Bonds of the Company
entered into an agreement under which the Company acquired and placed into
Treasury Stock all shares of stock of the Company owned by the Seller.  They
also agreed to maintain at the current amounts the Bond Administration Fees
charged by the Company to the Seller for the various Series of Bonds in which
the Seller participated.  As part of the agreement, an affiliate of the Company
(a subsidiary of ASAC), concurrently


                                       48
<PAGE>   49


purchased all of the assets of two Finance Companies (affiliates of the Seller)
that were participants in the Company's Series W and Series 38 Bonds.  The
Collateral relating to Series W was sold in December 1992; the Bonds were
subsequently redeemed in February 1993; and all benefits from the transaction
were paid to the subsidiary of ASAC.  Surplus relating to Series 38 continues
to be paid to the subsidiary of ASAC.  Another Director of the Company also
served as an Officer of the Seller at the time of the transaction.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





Shareholders and Board of Directors
American Southwest Financial Corporation

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of American Southwest Financial
Corporation as of June 30, 1993 and 1992.  These balance sheets are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these balance sheets based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the balance sheets are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the balance sheets.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall balance sheet
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the balance sheets referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of American Southwest Financial
Corporation as of June 30, 1993 and 1992, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                             JUNE 30, 1993 AND 1992

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS

Organization

                  American Southwest Financial Corporation (the "Company") was
organized for the purpose of issuing mortgage- collateralized bonds ("Bonds")
in series ("Series") consisting of one or more classes (each a "Class") to
facilitate the financing of long-term residential mortgage loans secured by
single-family residences.  The Bonds are collateralized by certificates of the
Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (collectively, all
such certificates are referred to as "Mortgage Certificates") and by
conventional mortgage loans (together with Mortgage Certificates referred to as
"Mortgage Collateral").  The Company does not have and is not expected to have
any significant assets other than cash and the assets pledged to secure
specific Series of Bonds.

                  On the closing of a Series of Bonds issued by the Company,
the Company applies the net proceeds of the Bonds toward the simultaneous
purchase or the repayment of indebtedness with respect to the Mortgage
Collateral securing such Series of Bonds or to fund loans to various entities
(the participating "Finance Companies") pursuant to funding agreements
("Funding Agreements") (defined further in Note 2).  The Company last issued a
Series of Bonds in September 1988.

                  Each Series of Bonds that has been issued is a nonrecourse
obligation of the Company payable solely from the Mortgage Collateral and other
collateral (together the "Collateral") pledged to secure such Series of Bonds.
Neither the Company, the Finance Companies nor the holders of the residual
interest in the REMICs (defined below), as applicable, have guaranteed, or
otherwise are





                                       5

<PAGE>   60
obligated to pay the Bonds of a Series except from the proceeds of the
Collateral securing such Series of Bonds.  The Company has made elections to
treat the arrangement by which the Collateral securing certain Series of Bonds
is held as "real estate mortgage investment conduits" ("REMICs") for federal
income tax purposes.  The residual interests in the REMICs (generally, the
right to receive the remaining cash flow available on Collateral after debt
service and payment of administrative expenses on Bonds) are owned by persons
other than the Company.

Discounts on Receivables Pursuant to Funding Agreements, Mortgage Securities
and Bonds

                  Discounts incurred in connection with the issuance of Bonds
and the related Collateral are amortized using the interest method over the
estimated life of the Bonds.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

                  The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments
approximates fair value.

NOTE 2 - MORTGAGE COLLATERAL

                  As a result of the elections by the Company to treat the
arrangement by which the Collateral securing certain Series of Bonds is held as
REMICs, the related income and expense of each such Series is reported as a
separate entity for federal income tax purposes.  For financial statement
purposes, the Mortgage Collateral securing the Bonds of a Series is presented
on the balance sheets as (i) "Receivables Pursuant to Funding Agreements"
(defined below) if the Mortgage Collateral securing such Series is owned by
Finance Companies and pledged by such Finance Companies to the Company pursuant
to Funding Agreements, or (ii)





                                       6
<PAGE>   61

"Mortgage Securities" if the Mortgage Collateral securing such Series is owned
by the Company.  The Bonds secured by the Mortgage Collateral are presented as
"Bonds Payable".

                  The Company and each Finance Company participating in a
Series of Bonds when the Mortgage Collateral is owned by the Finance Companies
and pledged to the Company enter into a Funding Agreement with respect to such
Series (collectively the "Funding Agreements") pursuant to which the Company
lends and such Finance Company borrows all or a portion of the proceeds from
the sale of the Bonds of such Series.  Each participating Finance Company
agrees to repay its loan from the Company by causing payments to be made to the
Trustee for the related Series of Bonds on behalf of the Company in such
amounts as are necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Finance
Company's loan made from the Company as it becomes due, and each Finance
Company pledges to the Company Collateral as security for its loan.  The
Company assigns to the Trustee its entire right, title and interest in the
Collateral and all proceeds thereof pledged under the Funding Agreements as
security for such Series of Bonds.  At June 30, 1993 and 1992, various funds
held by the Trustee pursuant to such Funding Agreements such as expense reserve
funds and debt service funds together with deposits of funds received from
payments on Mortgage Collateral, were approximately $111,526,000 and
$151,118,000, respectively.

                  Payments on the Mortgage Collateral and withdrawals from the
debt service funds are the source of funds for payments of principal and
interest on the Bonds.  Each Mortgage Certificate and mortgage loan is assigned
an initial funding amount which in the aggregate is at least equal to the
principal amount of the Bonds at the issue date.
<PAGE>   62

                  Funds generated by principal and interest payments on the
Mortgage Collateral securing a Series of Bonds are held by the Trustee until
the payment dates for the Bonds of such Series.  Amounts not required to make
principal and interest payments on the Bonds of a Series are used to pay
current fees and expenses, held in reserve funds for future fees and expenses,
held in special reserve funds securing the Bonds, paid to the Finance Companies
pursuant to the Funding Agreements, if any, or paid to the purchaser of the
residual interest in the REMIC, if any, with respect to such Series.

                 The interest rates and stated maturities for the Mortgage
Collateral generally are similar to the Bonds Payable

NOTE 3 - BONDS PAYABLE

                  As of June 30, 1993, the Company had issued 68 Series of
Bonds, of which 55 Series were outstanding with stated maturities ranging from
years 2002 through 2019.  The Bonds that bear interest at fixed rates have
rates ranging from 5.00% to 13.50%.  Certain Classes of Bonds bear interest at
variable rates, determined monthly or quarterly, equal to a stated percentage
above either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or (ii) the Cost of
Funds Index (COFI), subject,  in each case, to a maximum interest rate ceiling
established at the issuance date.  Certain Classes of Bonds are entitled to
receive principal payments only and do not bear interest.

                  Under the applicable indenture supplements (the "Series
Supplements"), the unpaid principal balances of certain Classes of "compound
interest" Bonds are increased by the amount of interest accrued but not paid on
each payment date.  The amount of principal to be paid at each payment date is
based on the distributions received from the Collateral since the prior payment
date.

Interest rates on mortgage loans underlying the Mortgage Collateral pledged to
secure the Bonds affect the rate of repayment on the Mortgage Collateral and
the timing of the return of principal to the Bondholders.  The following table
demonstrates the Bond principal reduction experienced by the Company:

                  The Series Supplements relating to certain Series of Bonds
issued by the Company provide that the Company has the option to redeem such
Bonds in whole or in part when specific criteria are met.  The Company
exercised the right to redeem the outstanding Bonds (or portions of the
outstanding Bonds) of several Series during the fiscal years ended June 30,
1993, 1992 and 1991.  At the time of a redemption, with the Company's and
Trustee's consent, the Finance Companies sell their underlying collateral and
pay off their Funding Agreements.  The Company utilizes the proceeds from such
sales to redeem the Bonds and remits the remainder to the participating Finance
Companies after charging each a prepayment penalty.  Prepayment penalties,
including charges to affiliates, are assessed in accordance with specific
policies established by the Company.  Any deviation





                                       9
<PAGE>   64
from these policies necessary to address unique Bond structures, Collateral
or other factors requires approval of the Company's Board of Directors
including a majority of the Directors who have no financial or other interest
in the matter.  See Note 6 for affiliated related party transactions.  Included
in accounts payable at June 30, 1993 and 1992 are liabilities of $212,983 and
$781,552, respectively, due to Finance Companies that participated in the
Series E partial redemptions.  Although redemption opportunities are favorable
in the current interest rate environment, the benefits of redemptions are not
predictable due to a variety of factors including uncertainty of the time at
which the Company may effect redemptions of the outstanding Bonds, prevailing
interest rates, other similar market factors and, in certain circumstances,
limitations under agreements entered into by the Company.

                  Additionally, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and
1992, the Company exercised its right (pursuant to the indenture and the
applicable Series Supplements) to effect the optional Class redemptions (known
as "clean-up calls") of the remaining outstanding amounts of certain Classes of
Bonds, utilizing corporate cash and funds owned by Finance Companies ("Escrowed
Reserve Funds" -see Note 8).  At June 30, 1992, amounts payable to the Escrowed
Reserve Funds accounts related to the clean-up calls are presented as other
obligations on the balance sheet.

NOTE 4 - BOND MODIFICATIONS

                  The Company did not modify the redemption rights relating to
any Series of Bonds during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.  During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company and the Trustee, in agreement with
Bondholders and pursuant to the indenture and as supplemented by the applicable
Series





                                       10
<PAGE>   65

Supplements, modified the redemption rights of the Series H Class 4 Bonds, the
Series I Class 3 Bonds, the Series J Class 3 Bonds and the Series K Class 3
Bonds through amendments of the applicable Series Supplements.  Future
modifications are not predictable due to a variety of factors including
uncertainty of the time at which the Company may effect modifications of the
outstanding Bonds, prevailing interest rates and other market factors, and, in
certain circumstances, they may be limited by agreements entered into by the
Company. 

NOTE 5 - TREASURY STOCK

                  The Company acquired from three shareholders a total of 3,000
shares  of Class A Common Stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company acquired from eight
shareholders a total of 8,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and sold a total
of 6,000 Class A shares at cost to Directors.  In each case, the shareholder
which sold the shares to the Company, simultaneously sold to two affiliated
companies its shares in such companies.  The total purchase price for the
shares of all three companies, in each case, was allocated to the shares based
on the relative book value of the companies on the date of the purchase.  The
Company also acquired, and subsequently retired, 1,000 shares of Class B Common
Stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 and 4,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992. The Company utilized
the cost method of accounting for the acquisitions of the Class A and Class B
shares.

NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

                  The Company receives the use of office space, equipment, and
certain managerial, administrative, financial and other services from an
affiliate, American Southwest Financial Services, Inc. ("ASFS") pursuant to the
terms of





                                       11
<PAGE>   66
an agreement (the "Mortgage Issuance and Administration Agreement") between the
Company and ASFS.  The Mortgage Issuance and Administration Agreement generally
provides for the Company to pay ASFS, on a quarterly basis, the shortfall
between the total fees earned for both the securities issuance services and the
securities administration services ASFS performs, and 110% of the overhead of
ASFS, subject to scheduled adjustments.  Management fees payable to ASFS at
June 30, 1993 and 1992 are $400,000 and $825,000, respectively, and are
included in accounts payable - affiliates.  ASFS also receives administration
fees for each Series of Bonds which are paid from the cash held as Escrowed
Reserve Funds or by the Trustee and are not expenses of the Company.  The
holders of Class A Stock of the Company and of American Southwest Finance Co.,
Inc. ("ASFCI"), an affiliate, own 100% of the Class A Stock of American
Southwest Affiliated Companies ("ASAC"), parent company of ASFS and various
other affiliates (together the "Consolidated Group").

                  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, the net
assets of certain Finance Companies were acquired by certain members of the
Consolidated Group.  Included in accounts payable - affiliates at June 30, 1992
is a liability of $2,387 due to ASAC for certain cash flows related to the
Series E partial redemptions (Note 3).

                  Additionally, the Company made advances to ASAC.  The
advances were collectible upon demand and the amounts presented on the balance
sheets include interest accrued at prime.  Subsequent to June 30, 1993, the
advances were paid in full with interest.

                  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, the
Company purchased at various times, portfolios of single-family mortgage loans
(the





                                       12

<PAGE>   67

"Mortgage Loans") and concurrently sold the Mortgage Loans at cost to an
affiliate, SecurNet Financial Corporation ("SecurNet").  SecurNet is a
subsidiary of ASAC and a member of the Consolidated Group.  The Mortgage Loans
had been pledged by Finance Companies to the Company as Collateral securing
Funding Agreements.  The Company acquired the Mortgage Loans and canceled the
outstanding principal amount of the receivable remaining under the Funding
Agreements.

                  To effect the acquisitions of Mortgage Loans from the
Company, SecurNet borrowed cash from the Escrowed Reserve Funds administered by
the Company.  SecurNet's borrowings are evidenced by a note, the principal
amount of which was not to exceed $5 million (raised to $8 million subsequent
to June 30, 1993 - see Note 10), collectible upon demand, secured by the
Mortgage Loans and bearing interest at prime, which was 6% and 6.5% at June 30,
1993 and 1992, respectively.  All Mortgage Loans have 100% mortgage insurance
by a AAA rated insurer, and the weighted average net interest rate of the
Mortgage Loans at June 30, 1993 was approximately 11.7%.  All payments received
on the Mortgage Loans are paid directly to the Escrowed Reserve Funds account.
At June 30, 1993, the balance of the Mortgage Loans with accrued interest was
$4,594,151 while SecurNet owed $3,930,918, including accrued interest.  At June
30, 1992, the balance of the Mortgage Loans with accrued interest was
$3,401,845 while the loan to SecurNet was $3,366,093.

                  Related party transactions involving the Company and Escrowed
Reserve Funds are discussed in Notes 3 and 8.

              In December 1992, the Company and a Finance Company (the "Seller")
that participated in various Series of Bonds of the Company entered into an
agreement  under which the Company acquired and placed into Treasury Stock all 
shares of





                                       13
<PAGE>   68
stock of the Company owned by the Seller.  They also agreed to maintain at the
current amounts the Bond Administration Fees charged by the Company to the
Seller for the various Series of Bonds in which the Seller participated.  As
part of the agreement, an affiliate of the Company (a subsidiary of ASAC),
concurrently purchased all of the assets of two Finance Companies (affiliates
of the Seller) that were participants in the Company's Series W and Series 38
Bonds.  The Collateral relating to Series W was sold in December 1992; the
Bonds were subsequently redeemed in February 1993; and all benefits from the
transaction were paid to the subsidiary of ASAC.  Surplus relating to Series 38
continues to be paid to the subsidiary of ASAC.  A Director of the Company also
served as an Officer of the Seller at the time of the transaction.

                  In September 1993 the Company and another Finance Company
sold the Collateral securing its Series 45 Bonds, paid the Bondholders all
principal and interest due on the redemption date and collected a negotiated
prepayment penalty.  Another Director of the Company also serves as a Director
and President of the residual holder.  

NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES

                  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, the Company
adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes.

                  At June 30, 1993, other receivables include prepaid income 
taxes of approximately $191,000 resulting from the overpayment of federal and 
state estimated taxes.  At June 30, 1992, accounts payable includes income 
taxes payable of approximately $1,800,000.

NOTE 8 - ESCROWED RESERVE FUNDS

                  The Company maintains, and invests on behalf of participating
Finance Companies, Escrowed Reserve Funds held primarily for future Bond
administration expenses.  These funds are not included in the Company's assets
or liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets as of June 30, 1993 and 1992.
Escrowed Reserve Funds held by the Company are comprised of the following at

</TABLE>

                  The relatively small decrease in Escrowed Reserve Funds at
June 30, 1993 as compared to June 30, 1992 was primarily due to releases of
such funds to participating Finance Companies pursuant to certain redemptions.
The Company believes that the Escrowed Reserve Funds at June 30, 1993, if
needed, as well as ongoing fees charged to participating Finance Companies, are
sufficient to meet the Finance Companies' future Bond administration
obligations, including their obligation to ASFS under the Mortgage Securities
Issuance and Administration Agreement.

Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona (the "Bankruptcy Court"), In re WE
Financial Co.,  an Arizona partnership (No. 92-1861- TUC-LO).

                  The Debtor had borrowed a portion of the proceeds of and
provided a portion of the Collateral for the Company's Bonds designated as
Series B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, X, Y, 3, 37,
39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 49, 52, 54 and 59 under Funding Agreements.  None
of the other Series of Bonds of the Company were affected by the Debtor's
Bankruptcy Case.
                  On November 10, 1992, the Company and the Debtor signed a
settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") that addressed all disputes
between the parties arising out of the Bankruptcy Case.  The Settlement
Agreement has resulted in the continuous payment in full of all amounts with
respect to its Bonds in accordance with their terms.

                  Additionally, under the Settlement Agreement, ASW Funding
Financial Corporation V ("ASW"), an affiliate of the Company, purchased from
the Debtor, among other things, the Collateral owned by the Debtor relating to
the Company's Bonds designated as Series C, E, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, T,
X, 39, 40, 42, 44, 46 and 49 (the "WE Financial Transferred Collateral")
(subject to the liens of the related Funding Agreements and Bond indenture) and
related assets (collectively, the "WE Financial Transferred Assets").  ASW
assumed the Debtor's obligations under the Funding Agreements secured by the WE
Financial Transferred Collateral.

                  In addition, ASW purchased from Guardian Financial Co.
("Guardian"), an affiliate of the Debtor, among other things, the Collateral
owned by Guardian relating to Bonds of ASFCI, an affiliate of the Company,
designated as Series 1984-1, R-5, R-6 and R-7 (the "Guardian Transferred
Collateral") (subject to the





                                       16
<PAGE>   71
liens of the related Guardian Funding Agreements and Bond indenture) and
related assets (collectively, the "Guardian Transferred Assets").  ASW assumed
Guardian's obligations under the Guardian Funding Agreement loans secured by
the Guardian Transferred Collateral.

                  The Settlement Agreement also provided for the sale of
certain Collateral owned by the Debtor relating to the Company's Series C and E
Bonds, for the sale of certain Collateral owned by Guardian relating to ASFCI's
Series R-5 and R-6 Bonds, and for the redemption of the pro rata portion of the
Series C, E, R-5 and R-6 Bonds corresponding to the Debtor's Collateral and
Guardian's Collateral, respectively, at full par value plus accrued interest,
in accordance with the terms of the indentures governing such Bonds.  A portion
of the net proceeds from such Collateral sales and redemptions were credited
against the purchase prices for the WE Financial Transferred Assets and the
Guardian Transferred Assets.

                  Under the Settlement Agreement, the Debtor transferred the
Collateral owned by the Debtor relating to the Company's Bonds designated as
Series B, D, F, N, O, S, U, Y, 3, 37, 41, 47, 52, 54 and 59 (subject to the
lien of the related Funding Agreements and Bond indenture) into a passive
non-business grantor trust (the "Grantor Trust").  Finally, the Settlement
Agreement provided for the execution by the parties thereto, and certain
affiliated parties, of mutual releases from liability with respect to
litigation commenced as part of the Bankruptcy Case.

                  On March 10, 1993, the Company closed the transaction
contemplated by the Debtor's First Amended Plan of Reorganization dated January
11, 1993, as modified (the "Amended Plan").  The Amended Plan implemented the
terms of the





                                       17
<PAGE>   72
Settlement Agreement between the Company and the Debtor and various of their
affiliates.  As of the closing, the Amended Plan was deemed to be substantially
consummated and all pending adversarial proceedings were dismissed.

NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

                  Since June 30, 1993, the Company has redeemed in full the
remaining outstanding balances of its Series D, Series N, Series 2 and Series 7
Bonds, and redeemed in part its Series F and Series 42.

                  On August 20, 1993, pursuant to a signed note, the Company
lent ASAC $100,000 at a stated interest rate of prime plus 3% on an unsecured
basis.

                  On September 15, 1993, the Board of Directors unanimously
approved an increase in the amount that SecurNet may borrow from Escrowed
Reserve Funds from $5 million to $8 million.

                 COLLATERAL CUSTODY AND VERIFICATION AGREEMENT

                          Dated as of August 31, 1993


                 Bank One, Arizona NA (the "Trustee") and First Bank National
Association, a national banking association (the "Custodian"), agree as
follows:

                 WHEREAS, the Trustee currently is trustee for each of the bond
issues identified on Schedule I hereto (the "Bond Issues") pursuant to the Bond

                 WHEREAS, the Trustee intends to resign as trustee, and
Custodian anticipates being appointed and accepting as successor trustee, under

separate records on its books the respective Collateral securing such Bond
Issue.

                 3.       Delivery of Collateral.  Trustee shall deliver

         regulations as may be reasonably imposed by the Custodian, permit the
         Trustee or any of its duly authorized representatives, servicing
         agents, attorneys or auditors to inspect the Collateral at such times

         records separate trust accounts of the types described on Exhibit F

the authority of any such officer to act and may be considered as in full force

agrees to indemnify the Trustee for any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, payments, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever which may
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Trustee as the Trustee as
the result of failure of the Custodian to perform its duties hereunder,
provided, however, that the Custodian shall not be liable for any portion of
any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, payments or costs due to
the actions or omissions of the Trustee.

                 8.       Advice of Counsel.  The Custodian and the Trustee
further agree that the Custodian shall be entitled to rely and act upon advice
of counsel with respect to  its performance hereunder as custodian and shall be
without liability for any action reasonably taken pursuant to such advice,

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, the Agent and the Trustee agree as
follows:

                 1.       Appointment as Agent.  Subject to the terms and
conditions herein, the Trustee hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby

provided in the related Indenture, commencing for each Bond Issue on the date
(a "Commencement Date") specified for such Bond Issue on Schedule III attached
hereto and continuing until Trusteeship Succession or prior termination of this
Agreement.

                 2.       Transfer of Registration Information.  At least

Trustee.  All such instructions shall contain receipt provisions which the
Agent shall countersign as such receipt confirmation.  A certified copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Trustee may be received and

indemnify the Trustee for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, payments, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Trustee as the Trustee as the
result of failure of the Agent to perform its duties hereunder, provided,
however, that the Agent shall not be liable for any portion of any such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, payments or costs due to the actions
or omissions of the Trustee.

                 6.       Advice of Counsel.  The Agent and the Trustee further
agree that the Agent shall be entitled to rely and act upon advice of counsel
with respect to  its performance hereunder as custodian and shall be without
liability for any action reasonably taken pursuant to such advice, provided
that such action is not in violation of applicable federal or state law.

                 7.       Effective Period, Termination and Amendment, and
Interpretive and Additional Provisions.  This Agreement shall become effective
as of the date hereof, shall continue in full force and effect until terminated
as hereinafter provided, may be amended at any time by mutual agreement of the
parties hereto shall terminate concurrently with the Trusteeship Succession and
otherwise may be terminated by either party by written notice delivered or
mailed to the other party, postage prepaid, termination to take effect no
sooner than thirty (30) days after the date of such delivery or mailing.
Concurrently with, or as soon as practicable after any termination other than
upon Trusteeship Succession, the Agent shall return all bond registration
information to the Trustee at such place as the Trustee may reasonably
designate.  In connection with the administration of this Agreement, the Agent
and the Trustee may agree from time to time upon the interpretation of the
provisions of this Agreement as may in their joint opinion be consistent with
the general tenor and purposes of this Agreement, any such interpretation to be
signed by all parties and annexed hereto.

                 8.       Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota.

                            PAYING AGENCY AGREEMENT

                         Dated as of September 30, 1993



                 Bank One, Arizona, NA, ("Trustee"), American Southwest
Financial Corporation, American Southwest Finance Co. and Westam Mortgage
Financial Corporation (collectively, the "Issuers") and First Bank National
Association, (the "Agent"), agree as follows:

                 WHEREAS, the Trustee currently is trustee for each of the bond
issues identified on Schedule I hereto (the "Bond Issues") pursuant to the
respective Bond Indentures between the Issuers and The Valley National Bank of
Arizona (the "Original Indentures") and Supplemental Indentures set forth on
Schedule II hereto (together with the Original Indenture collectively, the
"Indentures"), and in connection therewith, the Trustee acts as paying agent
for each Bond Issue.

                 WHEREAS, the Trustee intends to resign as trustee, and the
Issuers anticipate appointing Agent and Agent anticipates accepting as
successor trustee, under each of the Indentures (the "Trusteeship Succession"),
and to facilitate transition of bond paying agent functions, the parties desire
that Agent shall act as the paying agent to perform such functions prior to and
after the Trusteeship Succession, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the Indentures, and terms and conditions herein.

                 WHEREAS, the Trustee and the Agent have entered into that
certain Collateral Custody and Verification Agreement dated as of August 31,
1993 (the "Collateral Agreement") to provide for the transfer of Bond Issue
collateral to the Agent and the establishment of separate trust accounts to
which such collateral, and cash received with respect to collateral, is
credited by the Agent.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, the Agent, the Issuers and the Trustee
agree as follows:

                 1.       Appointment as Agent.  Subject to the terms and
conditions herein, the Issuers hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby
accepts such appointment, as the paying agent under Section 9.02 of each of the
Original Indentures to perform the payment and recordkeeping functions thereof
("Paying Functions") for each Bond Issue as provided in the related Indenture,
commencing for each Bond Issue on October 1, 1993 ("Commencement Date") and
continuing until termination of this Agreement.

                 2.       Transfer of Payment Information.  At least ten
business days prior to the Commencement Date, the Trustee will provide the
Agent with all bond ownership and payment information for each Bond Issue in
hard copy format and compatible with Agent's Bond Master processing system, all
as necessary or appropriate for Agent to perform Paying Functions for the Bond
Issues on behalf of the Issuer.  As part of the said bond payment information,
the Trustee will provide and certify to the Agent for each Bond Issue (i) the
name and address of each registered bondholder, (ii) the

                                                        EXHIBIT C (cont'd)

principal amount of bonds with the same maturity date owned by such bondholder,
(iii) the IRS Taxpayer Identification Number of such bondholder and (iv)
whether or not an IRS Form W-9 has been received from, making back-up
withholding not required for, such bondholder.

                 At least ten business days prior to the Commencement Date, the
Issuers will provide and certify to the Agent for each Bond Issue the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of bonds with the same maturity date, as of
September 1, 1993.

                 3.       Payment Information Reconciliation.  Within seven
business days following receipt of complete bond payment information, as
described in paragraph 2 above, for each Bond Issue, the Agent will reconcile
(i) the total of Bondholders' principal balances with the same maturity date as
provided by the Trustee (ii) with the aggregate principal balances for such
maturity date provided by the Issuers.  Within three business days of
discovering any discrepancy in such principal balance information or in other
bond paying information, the Agent will advise the Trustee and the Issuers.
All such discrepancies shall be resolved and corrected prior to Trusteeship
Succession for all Bond Issues.

                 4.       Trust Account Payments.  The Agent shall liquidate
investments and withdraw monies to pay Bond Issue principal and interest as
due, from the appropriate trust accounts established by the Agent under the
Collateral Agreement prior to Trusteeship Succession and by the Agent as
successor trustee under the Indentures following Trusteeship Succession.

                 5.       Payment Reports.  The Issuers shall provide payment
and disbursement reports to the Agent in the form and manner as heretofore
provided to the Trustee, setting forth the amounts of bondholder payments,
releases of surplus funds and expense payments and payees.

                 6.       Advice of Counsel.  The parties further agree that
the Agent shall be entitled to rely and act upon advice of counsel with respect
to  its performance hereunder as paying agent and shall be without liability
for any action reasonably taken pursuant to such advice, provided that such
action is not in violation of applicable federal or state law.

                 7.       Effective Period, Termination and Amendment, and
Interpretive and Additional Provisions.  This Agreement shall become effective
as of the date hereof, shall continue in full force and effect until terminated
as hereinafter provided, and may be amended at any time by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto.  This Agreement may be terminated by either the Issuers or
the Agent by written notice delivered or mailed to the other parties, postage

date of such delivery or mailing.  Concurrently with, or as soon as practicable
after any termination, the Agent shall transfer all bond payment information to
such successor paying agent as the Issuers shall designate.  In connection with
the administration of this Agreement, the Agent, the Issuers and the Trustee
may agree from time to time upon the interpretation of the provisions of this
Agreement as may in their joint opinion be consistent with the general tenor
and purposes of this Agreement, any such interpretation to be signed by all
parties and

Dear Mr. Eggebrecht:

After long and careful consideration, Valley National Bank had made difficult
decision to cease bond trustee activity in the collateralized mortgage
obligation ("CMO") field.  We have become increasingly aware that we lack the
economics of scale available to larger CMO trustees and cannot compete
effectively given the fees bid in today's marketplace.  We therefore, tender
our resignation as Trustee of the bond issues of American Southwest Financial
Corporation, American Southwest Finance Co., Inc. and Westam Mortgage Financial
Corporation effective January 1, 1993.

We have enjoyed the many years of working with American Southwest Financial
Corporation, American Southwest Finance Co., Inc. and Westam Mortgage Financial
Corporation.  The professionalism of the staff has been exemplary and we will
miss them all.  Our association has also provided us with the privilege to meet
people and develop working relationships throughout the country which would
otherwise have been missed.  We will take every opportunity to make the
transition to your selected successor trustee as smooth and uneventful as
possible.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Susan J. McCord

                        TRUSTEESHIP SUCCESSION AGREEMENT


                 BANK ONE, ARIZONA, NA ("Bank One"), FIRST BANK NATIONAL

AMERICAN SOUTHWEST FINANCE CO., INC. and WESTAM MORTGAGE FINANCIAL CORPORATION
(collectively, the "Issuers"), hereby amend that certain Trusteeship Succession
Agreement, among the parties hereto (the "Trusteeship Succession Agreement"),

                 1.       All terms and provisions of the Trusteeship

Amendment, are hereby confirmed to be in full force and effect.  All
capitalized terms used in this Confirmation and First Amendment shall have the
meaning ascribed thereto in the Trusteeship Succession Agreement.

                 2.       Bank One has previously resigned as trustee for each
Bond Issue by its execution and delivery to the Issuers of a letter, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit D-1.  Effective on December 28, 1993, the
Issuers shall appoint First Bank as successor trustee for each Bond Issue by

Agreement as Exhibit D-3.

                 3.       Certified lists of Bond Issue Collateral received by
First Trust identify certain items of Collateral that have not been transferred
to First Bank because such Collateral has been sold or the related Bond Issue
is not subject to the Trusteeship Succession.  In addition, such certified
lists of Collateral contain certain incorrect factors or original face amounts.
Bank One, First Bank and the Issuers agree that such certified list Collateral
discrepancies will be corrected or reconciled following Trusteeship Succession
through the diligent and good faith efforts of each party to be concluded no
later than March 1, 1994.

                 4.       First Bank has received delivery of document files
for all Pledged Loans, other than the Pledged Loans identified on Exhibit A
hereto (the "Undelivered Files"), but final review of such files is not
complete.  Undelivered Files shall be delivered to First Bank no later than
January 15, 1994.  Pledged Loan document file review will be completed by First
Bank, and document delivery exceptions identified to Bank One and the Issuers,
no later than January 30, 1994 and replacement of missing documents, or
correction of incomplete or defective documents will be undertaken by First
Bank; provided, however, that Bank One shall not hereby be released from any
liability for which it could be liable under the Indentures for any financial
loss resulting from, and the Issuers shall pay all costs related to obtaining
certified copies of documents filed of public record evidencing correction of
such Pledged Loan document exceptions.

                 5.       First Bank by March 1, 1994, shall review the
contents of Bond Issue records, correspondence and statements not constituting
Collateral and request receipt from Bank One of missing information.  Bank One
shall deliver to First Bank by April 1,

Bank shall use their best efforts to execute and deliver supplemental
indentures to the Indentures, consistent with the amendment terms thereof,
providing for modified financial and distribution reports to the Trustee from
the Issuers conforming Indenture provisions to current reporting practices and
formats.

                 7.       On or before January 10, 1994, First Bank will
identify in writing to Bank One certain Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements that were previously filed with respect to certain Collateral and
have lapsed without continuation or without new financing statement filing.  On
or before February 1, 1994, Bank One will provide First Bank with filed copies
of financing statements reestablishing perfection of such liens in the related
Collateral, and the Issuers, to the extent not previously addressed in an
opinion delivered to Bank One, shall provide First Bank with an opinion of
counsel that such Collateral liens are perfected, first priority security
interests.

                 8.       On or before January 20 , 1994, Bank One shall
execute and the Issuers shall file of record assignments to First Bank, as
trustee, of those Uniform Commercial Code financing statements currently in
effect that must be so assigned to perfect such trustee's security interests in

file in the office of Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, Uniform
Commercial Code financing statements naming First Bank, as trustee, as secured
party for all Collateral for which lien perfection is accomplished by such
financing statement filing.  On or before February 15, 1994, the Issuers shall
provide to First Bank an opinion of counsel under the laws of all governing
jurisdictions other than Minnesota, and First Bank shall obtain an opinion from
its counsel under the laws of Minnesota, to the effect that First Bank as
trustee under the Indentures, holds valid, perfected, first priority security
interests in the Collateral under the governing Uniform Commercial Code.

delivered this Confirmation and First Amendment to Trusteeship Succession
Agreement as of December 28, 1993.
