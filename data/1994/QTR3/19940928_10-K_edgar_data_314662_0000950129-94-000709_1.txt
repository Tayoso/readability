ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

National Convenience Stores Incorporated (the "Company") is the largest
operator of convenience stores in the state of Texas and one of the twenty
largest in the United States.  At June 30, 1994, the Company operated 709
specialty convenience stores in four cities in the state of Texas under the
name Stop N Go(SM).  Eighty percent of the Company's stores are located in the
Houston and San Antonio, Texas areas where the Company is the largest
convenience store operator.   The stores sell fresh foods, traditional fast
foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, tobacco products, groceries,
lotto/lottery tickets, health and beauty aids and other nonfood merchandise,
specialty items and incidental services.  Approximately 90% of the Company's
stores are equipped with self-serve gasoline dispensing facilities.  The
Company originally organized as a Texas corporation in 1959 and was
reincorporated in Delaware in 1979.  As more fully described below under
"Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Reorganization", the Company filed for voluntary Chapter
11 bankruptcy reorganization on December 9, 1991 and emerged from such on March
9, 1993 as a result of the confirmation of the Company's Revised Fourth Amended
and Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan of Reorganization").  In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company divested its 80 operating
convenience stores in the states of California and Georgia and acquired 88
stores in the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth areas.  With the consummation of
this transaction the Company attained its goal of geographically consolidating
its operations to within the state of Texas.

The following table sets forth the distribution of the Company's stores by
market as of June 30, 1994:

STORE OPERATIONS

The Company's convenience stores are extended-hour retail facilities,
emphasizing convenience to the customer.  Substantially all the stores are open
every day of the year and 608 operate 24 hours a day.  Typically, the Company's
stores are located in residential areas, on main





                                      -1-
<PAGE>   5
thoroughfares, in small shopping centers or on other sites selected for easy
accessibility and customer convenience.  The stores' exteriors are of a similar
design and color making them easily recognizable.  The Company emphasizes
high-quality products, personal and courteous service, and clean and modern
stores.  The stores attract lunch-time customers, early and late shoppers,
weekend and holiday shoppers and customers who need only a few items at any
time and desire rapid service.  Approximately fifty of the stores are also
targeted to attract the fast-food take- out customer via easily recognized
national brand name "eatery" fast-food offerings.

The Company's stores offer a diverse range of over 3,000 high-traffic consumer
items including take-out foods, traditional fast-foods, fountain beverages,
alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, soft drinks, candy, snacks, groceries,
health and beauty aids, magazines and newspapers, automotive products, seasonal
and promotional items, and school supplies.  The Company sells lottery tickets
in all of its stores and lotto tickets in most of its stores.  Substantially
all of the Company's stores sell money orders.  Approximately 90% of the
Company's stores are equipped with self-serve gasoline-dispensing facilities.

The following table sets forth certain statistical information regarding the
Company's sales for the periods indicated:

__________________
(1)   Reflects the combining of the four months ended June 30, 1993
      (reorganized company) and the eight months ended February 28, 1993
      (predecessor company).

The Company is continuing with its Neighborstore(R) concept merchandising
strategy, whereby each store's product mix is linked directly to its local
demographics and customer purchasing patterns.  In certain instances the
stores' product display and general appearance have been changed to match the
demographics.  Additionally, in fiscal 1991, the Company successfully pioneered
the offering of national brand name fast-foods in "eateries" within the
Company's convenience stores.  The Company's "eateries" are a smaller scale
version of the branded food kiosks found in shopping malls and airports.  The
national brand name fast-food items are prepared in-store with identical
ingredients, packaging, procedures and quality standards as are used in the
branded partners' own free-standing restaurants.  The Company currently
operates 53 fast food "eateries" in 50 of its stores.  Brands represented in
these stores include:  Taco





                                      -2-
<PAGE>   6
Bell(R), Kentucky Fried Chicken(R), Burger King(R), Pizza Hut(R), Dunkin
Donuts(R), and Earl Campbell's Barbecue Express(R).

In addition, the Company has a program for the continual updating of its older
stores.  Consistent with the Neighborstore concept, the policy is flexible in
both layout and product mix.  

The Company recognizes that its future operations will be dependent in part 
on the continual remodeling and upgrading of its store base.  A store 
replacement program will also eventually be required in
order for the Company's stores to continue to be geographically located near
its target customers' residences and workplaces.

The Company estimates that it serves, on average, an aggregate of approximately
600,000 customers per day.  The Company's operations are benefitted by warm,
dry weather since a large part of the Company's product mix is concentrated in
items that are consumed during periods when leisure-time activities are more
prevalent.

The Company's stores vary in terms of layout, size and quantity of items
carried.  The Company's basic design is a 2,600 square-foot,
rectangularly-shaped store.  In 1984, the Company developed a hexagonally-shaped
3,100 square-foot store (the "Hex").  These stores are generally built on a
readily accessible corner location at a major intersection in an area of high
population density.  Approximately 85% of the Company's stores are of the basic
rectangular shape and 13% are of the Hex design.  The Company also operates 20
"Superstores," a 3,600 square-foot store design which was superseded by the Hex
store.

As is the norm in the convenience store industry, prices on most items are
somewhat higher than in supermarkets and certain other retail outlets; however,
the value placed by the customer on easy accessibility and convenience has
historically enabled the Company to receive premium prices for its products.
The Company does price-promote certain items in various key merchandise
categories to aid in building customer traffic.  Most of the items sold are
nationally or locally advertised brands, which includes the Company's own
private label cigarette.  Substantially all sales are for cash or check,
although the Company also accepts credit cards (VISA and MasterCard) and debit
cards.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 the Company began the implementation
of a program to enhance and redefine the Company's focus on customer service
and employee effectiveness.  This program is the result of an extensive review
by management and outside consultants.  An integral component of the program
involves the upgrading of equipment and technology through the installation of
integrated state-of-the-art sales and inventory management systems.  These
systems will significantly automate store operations by capturing data on
point-of-sale and scanning equipment.  The program will also install
pay-at-the-pump fueling stations at 60 of its stores which sell gasoline.  The
Company initiated the program in its Dallas/Fort Worth stores in early fiscal
1995 and estimates that it will incur in the aggregate capital expenditures of
approximately $10.0 million in such market by mid fiscal 1995.  Additionally,
the Company estimates that it will incur approximately $3.2 million in
consulting expenses in conjunction with the program, $1.3 million of which were
incurred in fiscal 1994.  The Company will evaluate





                                      -3-
<PAGE>   7
the success of the program in the Dallas/Fort Worth test market before making
the decision to expand it to all of the Company's stores.

SUPPLIERS

The Company purchases a substantial portion of its groceries, candy, tobacco
and health and beauty aids through wholesale grocers.  Soft drinks, beer, wine,
bakery and dairy products are usually purchased from local suppliers.  The
Company also operates a Corporate Kitchen in Houston, Texas where it prepares
and packages sandwiches, salads, snacks and other prepackaged foods for
distribution to its stores in the Texas markets via two of its major suppliers.

The Company purchases substantially all of its gasoline supplies from
independent petroleum refiners and some gasoline supplies from major oil
companies in the wholesale markets.  The Company's inventories of gasoline turn
over approximately every seven days, and the Company does not engage in
speculative gasoline trading transactions or otherwise assume unusual market
risks with respect thereto.

REGULATORY MATTERS

In certain of the Company's market areas, federal, state or local laws regulate
the hours of operation and the sale of certain products, typically including
alcoholic beverages, gasoline, tobacco products and lottery and lotto tickets.
The most significant of such regulations limits or governs the sale of
alcoholic beverages and the storage and sale of gasoline.

Sale of Alcoholic Beverages - State and local regulatory agencies have the
authority to approve, revoke, suspend or deny applications for and renewals of
permits and licenses relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages and to impose
various restrictions and sanctions.  In many states, retailers of alcoholic
beverages have been held responsible for damages caused by intoxicated
individuals who purchased alcoholic beverages from them.  While the potential
exposure to the Company as a seller of alcoholic beverages is substantial, the
Company has adopted procedures to minimize such exposure and, to date,
management believes liability for such sales has not had a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Storage and Sale of Gasoline - The operation and ownership of underground
storage tanks ("USTs") is subject to federal, state and local laws and
regulations. Federal regulations issued in 1984 and amended in 1988 pursuant to
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, required the Environmental
Protection Agency (the "EPA") to establish a comprehensive regulatory program
for the detection, prevention and clean-up of leaking USTs.

The EPA has issued regulations, including most recently the 1988 amendment to
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, that establish requirements for (i)
maintaining leak detection methods and equipment, (ii) upgrading USTs, (iii)
taking corrective action in response to leaks, (iv) closing USTs to prevent
future leaks, (v) keeping appropriate records and (vi) maintaining evidence of
financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating third
parties





                                      -4-
<PAGE>   8
for bodily injury and property damage resulting from releases.  These
regulations also empower states to develop, administer and enforce their own
regulatory programs, incorporating requirements which are at least as stringent
as the federal standards.  In order to ensure compliance with the federal and
state environmental laws, the Company has developed a comprehensive gasoline
storage and dispensing plan.  During fiscal 1993, the Company refined the plan
such that presently its primary focus is on upgrading gasoline dispensing
equipment in accordance with upcoming deadlines imposed by regulatory
authorities and on providing for the clean-up of existing and future
contaminated sites.  The gasoline plan generally covers all properties operated
by the Company.

Environmental Capital Commitments - To meet the minimum federal leak detection
requirements, all product lines had to have line leak detectors installed as of
December 22, 1990, and as of December 22, 1993, the Company had adopted
approved tank system leak detection methods on all owned or operated USTs.  The
Company chose, in most cases, to meet this requirement by utilizing annual tank
testing with daily inventory reconciliation.  The Company installed pressurized
distribution piping with automatic line leak detectors as of December 22, 1990,
in accordance with the regulations.  Beginning in fiscal year 1995, the Company
will adopt the Statistical Inventory Reconciliation Method ("SIR") for the
detection of leaking tanks.  This method involves statistical analysis of
gasoline inventory changes to detect leaking USTs.

The federal regulations require the Company to have installed spill/overfill
and corrosion protection equipment by December 22, 1998.  However, the State of
Texas requires all USTs to be upgraded with the spill/overfill prevention
equipment by December 22, 1994.  The Company estimates that, as of June 30,
1994, 82% of its tanks have spill/overfill prevention equipment installed.  The
Company's 1995 capital budget contains the necessary funds to upgrade the
remaining tanks with spill/overfill prevention equipment and, consequently, the
Company anticipates it will be in compliance with the December 22, 1994
deadline imposed by the State of Texas.  The Company further estimates that 70%
of its USTs are protected from corrosion either by installing fiberglass or
steel fiberglass tanks or by upgrading existing steel tanks with cathodic
protection.  Management of the Company believes that the Company's long-range
capital budget contains sufficient funds necessary to upgrade the remaining
tanks prior to the December 22, 1998 deadline.

In addition to the foregoing, the EPA has ranked the air quality in major
cities in the United States based on the level of ozone measured.  Two areas in
which the Company currently conducts operations are considered to be ozone
non-attainment areas:  Houston and the Dallas/Fort Worth area.  The Houston
market is classified in the severe ozone non-attainment category while the
Dallas/Fort Worth area is classified in the moderate ozone non-attainment
category.  Under rules promulgated by the EPA and the State of Texas, gasoline
dispensing facilities in the two areas are required to have Stage II Vapor
Recovery Equipment, by November 15, 1994, on all units except those that have
not dispensed more than 10,000 gallons in any one month since January 1991.

During fiscal 1994 and 1993, the Company spent $6.6 million and $4.4 million,
respectively, on environmental capital equipment, including $6.1 million and
$3.1 million, respectively, on





                                      -5-
<PAGE>   9
Stage II Vapor Recovery Equipment.  In order to ultimately comply with the
aforementioned regulations by the deadlines described, the Company estimates it
will have to spend approximately $11.8 million on additional equipment and
installation through fiscal 1999, including $6.0 million for Stage II Vapor
Recovery Equipment.

Environmental Remediation Contingency - The majority of the Company's
environmental remediation expenditures relate to the clean-up of contaminated
soil caused by leaking underground gasoline storage tanks and underground
piping systems. During the second quarter of fiscal year 1992 the Company
completed a comprehensive plan covering its underground storage tanks in light
of the expected funding shortfalls in the various state reimbursement programs.
As a result, the Company recorded an increase to the environmental remediation
reserve of $16.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 1992.   Not
included in this liability is approximately $4.0 million of reimbursements from
established state funds which the Company believes to be probable of recovery.
In connection with an updated environmental remediation cost analysis the
Company increased its liability for future environmental remediation and tank
removal costs by an additional $6.6 million in February 1993.  At June 30,
1994, the remediation reserve totalled $21.8 million which included a $4.0
million reclassification, recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year
1994, related to anticipated reimbursements for future expenditures from
established state trust funds which the Company believes to be probable of
recovery.  Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year 1994, this $4.0
million amount is also included as an other asset in the Company's balance
sheet.  The states in which the Company operates, or has previously operated,
have established trust funds for the reimbursement of costs related to
remediation activities.  The actual cost of remediating contaminated sites and
removing tanks may be substantially lower or higher than that reserved due to
the difficulty in estimating such costs and due to potential changes in the
status of regulation and state reimbursement programs.  The Company does not
believe that any such amount below or in excess of that accrued is reasonably
estimable.

     Since 1988, the Company has spent approximately $11.4 million for 
remediation activities at sites the Company is operating or has previously
operated.  Approximately 43% of such costs qualify for reimbursement from the
various trust funds and the Company has been reimbursed $3.7 million for such
costs through June 30, 1994.  According to published reports, the Texas
Petroleum Storage Tank Reimbursement Fund was depleted during 1993 which has
necessitated delaying payment on reimbursement applications.  As of June 30,
1994, the Company had filed claims with the State of Texas for the reimbursement
of $1.2 million for past expenditures.  Such reimbursement is included in other
assets.  While the Company believes the reimbursements are collectible, the
Company estimates it could be several years before reimbursement occurs.

     The Company is required by state regulations to maintain evidence of 
financial responsibility for taking corrective action on remediation
activities.  In order to be in compliance with these requirements, the Company
has successfully established that it is self-insured, with verification by the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

EMPLOYEES

As of June 30, 1994, the Company has approximately 5,300 employees, of whom
approximately 230 are executive and supervisory personnel, approximately 4,400
are full-time store employees, and the balance are full-time staff personnel
and part-time store employees.  The Company experiences the high rate of
turnover of store employees prevalent in the convenience store industry.  The
Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and believes its
relations with its employees to be satisfactory.


COMPETITION

The convenience store industry is highly competitive, and the Company competes
with other convenience stores, local and national grocery store chains,
gasoline service stations, drug stores, fast food operations, vending machines,
discount stores and other types of retail outlets.  The Company is the largest
operator, or among the largest operators, of convenience stores in its major
market areas.  Each of the Company's stores competes primarily in its
surrounding neighborhood, and the ability of each store to compete is largely
dependent on location, access, signage, area, population growth, demographics
and product mix.

The Company also encounters competition from gasoline service stations which
have installed facilities for the sale of other consumer items.  These gasoline
service stations have become a significant competitor within the convenience
store industry.

Although competition from gasoline retailers has increased in recent years, the
Company's traditional convenience store competitors have significantly
curtailed their new store construction programs in, or withdrawn from, some of
the Company's major market areas as a result of their poor operating
performance.  Several of the country's largest convenience store operators have
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in recent years.
Nevertheless, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its major
competitors may further reduce or expand their operations in cities where the
Company operates.


CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing - On December 9, 1991, (the "Petition Date") the
Company and substantially all of its wholly-owned active subsidiaries filed
voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the "Bankruptcy Court").
The filing was precipitated by the loss of vendor credit which had become
critical to the Company's financing needs as a result of poor operating
results.  In 1987, the Company began experiencing substantial net losses from
its operations which it funded via a series of asset sales and sale and
leaseback transactions.  The excess of the sales proceeds over the operating
losses requiring funding was used to reduce the Company's outstanding long-
term debt.  Despite the substantial reductions in long-term debt, the net
operating losses resulted in





                                      -7-

the Company being required to obtain amendments to cure defaults of various
financial ratio coverage tests contained in the Company's long-term bank debt
agreements.  Subsequently, the Company found it was unable to sell additional
operating assets at prices regarded by management as reasonable.  This
combination of events led the Company, in its first quarter of fiscal 1992, to
develop a rigorous cash conservation and liquidity enhancement program in
preparation for the Company's winter third quarter, in which it had
historically experienced substantial negative cash flows.  A key ingredient in
the program was the continued supply of vendor trade credit in the range of $30
to $35 million.  However, commencing in the fourth week of November 1991, the
Company experienced a rapid multi-million dollar reduction in the availability
of such trade credit.  As a result of the virtual elimination of vendor trade
credit and the cutoff of deliveries of goods, the Company decided on December
9, 1991 to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Strategic Review of Company and Store Operations - Immediately upon entering
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, the Company began implementing a series
of cost reductions aimed at improving operating results.  Chief among the cost
reduction programs was a strategic review of store operations that evaluated
each individual store, taking into consideration such factors as historical and
projected cash flows, lease or ownership terms, age and condition of the
property, the nature and amount of insurance claims, competition and the
potential for future changes to any of the foregoing.  The objective of the
strategic review was to restructure the operations of the Company in order to
maximize its cash-flow generating capability and achieve its ultimate return to
long-term profitability.  Other cost reduction efforts were based on utilizing
the benefits of operating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to reduce
specific expenses.

As a result of the strategic review of store operations, the Company filed
motions to reject 188 leases covering stores already closed as of the Petition
Date.  In addition, the review resulted in a 27% downsizing of the Company's
convenience store operations from a 986 store base as of the Petition Date to
the 719 store base at June 30, 1993.  The downsizing was accomplished pursuant
to the Bankruptcy Code, wherein the Company had the right to assume or reject
executory contracts, including any unexpired leases.  Also, the Company entered
into lease amendments with landlords covering approximately 20% of the
Company's leased stores, as well as other equipment lessors to obtain rent
expense reductions.

As part of the strategic review, on July 10, 1992, the Company consummated the
sale of 21 operating convenience stores located in and around the San Francisco
Bay area.  Also, on April 29, 1994, the Company completed the transaction
whereby the Company, (i) exchanged its 53 operating convenience stores in
Southern California, together with related inventories and equipment, for 88
operating convenience stores of The Circle K Corporation in the Dallas/Fort
Worth and Houston, Texas areas, together with related inventories and equipment
and, (ii) sold its 27 operating convenience stores in Atlanta, Georgia,
together with related inventories and equipment, for cash consideration of
$9,150,000.   The Company is continuing to pursue the disposition of its
surplus real estate with any resulting net cash proceeds being applied to
reduce the outstanding balances as required under the Company's long-term bank
debt agreements.

Restructuring and Other Special Charges - In connection with the Chapter 11
filing and the





                                      -8-
<PAGE>   12
resultant strategic review of company and store operations, the Company
recorded $168.1 million of Restructuring and Other Special Charges at December
31, 1991, related to store closings, other assets affected by the Chapter 11
filing, insurance and environmental matters.  See Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 herein
for a complete description of the various components of the charges.

Plan of Reorganization (Effective March 9, 1993) - As a result of extensive
negotiations held in December 1992, the Company reached a compromise agreement
which was incorporated into and became the Plan of Reorganization.  The
Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan of Reorganization on
February 25, 1993.  The Plan of Reorganization subsequently became effective
March 9, 1993 (the "Effective Date").

The Plan of Reorganization was designed to repay all priority creditors in full
on the Effective Date or thereafter as provided in the Plan of Reorganization
and to repay secured creditors in full over time with interest.  Allowed
unsecured claims totalling approximately $137.5 million were canceled in
exchange for $9.3 million of cash, $1.0 million of new indebtedness and 5.91
million shares of newly issued Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
reorganized company.  All existing Series E Preferred Stock and existing common
stock of the predecessor company were exchanged for an aggregate distribution
of 90,000 shares of the newly issued Common Stock of the reorganized company.
Consequently, a total of 6.0 million shares of newly issued Common Stock of the
reorganized company were issued under the Plan of Reorganization.  In addition,
warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate 1.35 million shares of newly
issued Common Stock at $17.75 per share were distributed to the holders of the
predecessor company's two publicly-held subordinated debenture series, the
Series E Preferred Stock and the old common stock.  All alleged seniority
rights rising under the indentures relating to the publicly-held subordinated
debentures were deemed satisfied and canceled as of the Effective Date.  In
addition, the Plan of Reorganization authorized the issuance of stock options
to purchase up to 900,000 shares of Common Stock of the reorganized company to
certain key employees and directors at $10.50 per share.

Even though the Company has successfully emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, the Bankruptcy Court continues to exercise the authority to resolve
disputes on pre-petition claims of creditors, to make rulings on matters
related to the assumption or rejection of executory contracts and leases
pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization and to make judgments on other matters
related to the Plan of Reorganization.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE DISCUSSION BELOW SETS FORTH VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS,
BUT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN EXHAUSTIVE SUMMARY.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
REGARDING THE EFFECT ON THE DEBTOR GROUP OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, REFERENCE SHOULD
BE MADE TO THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND THE CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS OF THE DEBTOR
GROUP.

REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS UNDER CHAPTER 11

Chapter 11 Filing - On December 9, 1991, the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries (the "Debtor Group") filed separate petitions for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court.  On December
11, 1991, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order for the cases to be jointly
administered.  The cases were jointly administered under Case No.
91-49816-H4-11.  A complete list of the Debtor Group which filed petitions for
reorganization is set forth below:

                   National Convenience Stores Incorporated
                   Stop N Go Markets of Texas, Inc.
                   Stop N Go Markets of Georgia, Inc.

                   Twelfth NCS Realty Company
                   Thirteenth NCS Realty Company
                   Kempco Petroleum Company
                   Hot Stop Foods, Inc.
                   Texas Super Duper Markets, Inc.
                   Jay's Washaterias, Inc.


Shortly after the Petition Date, an official unsecured creditors' committee
(the "Committee"), representing all unsecured creditors of the Debtor Group,
including both the publicly-held debentures and the unsecured trade creditors,
was organized.  The Committee had the right to review and object to certain
business transactions and participated in the formulation of the Plan of
Reorganization.  The Debtor Group was required to pay certain expenses of the
Committee, including legal counsel, accountants and other professional fees, to
the extent approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

Plan of Reorganization - As a result of extensive negotiations held in December
1992, the Company reached a compromise agreement which was incorporated into
and became the Plan of Reorganization.  The Bankruptcy Court entered an order
confirming the Plan of





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   16
Reorganization on February 25, 1993.  The Plan of Reorganization subsequently
became effective March 9, 1993 (the "Effective Date").

The Plan of Reorganization was designed to repay all priority creditors in full
on the Effective Date or thereafter as provided in the Plan of Reorganization
and to repay secured creditors in full over time with interest.  Allowed
unsecured claims totalling approximately $137.5 million were canceled in
exchange for $9.3 million of cash, $1.0 million of new indebtedness and 5.91
million shares of newly issued Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
reorganized company.  All existing Series E Preferred Stock and existing common
stock of the predecessor company were exchanged for an aggregate distribution
of 90,000 shares of the newly issued Common Stock of the reorganized company.
Consequently, a total of 6.0 million shares of newly issued Common Stock of the
reorganized company were issued under the Plan of Reorganization.  In addition,
warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate 1.35 million shares of newly
issued Common Stock at $17.75 per share were distributed to the holders of the
predecessor company's two publicly-held subordinated debenture series, the
Series E Preferred Stock and the old common stock.  All alleged seniority
rights rising under the indentures relating to the publicly-held subordinated
debentures were deemed satisfied and canceled as of the Effective Date.  In
addition, the Plan of Reorganization authorized the issuance of stock options
to purchase up to 900,000 shares of Common Stock of the reorganized company to
certain key employees and directors at $10.50 per share.

Claims Procedures - Pre-petition claims held by creditors of the Debtor Group
which were contingent or unliquidated at the commencement of the Chapter 11
proceedings were generally allowable against the Debtor Group in amounts fixed
by the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise agreed upon.  These claims, including,
without limitation, those which arise in connection with the rejection of
executory contracts and lease obligations and with resolution of litigation,
are expected to be substantial.

The Company is continuing to research and evaluate the proofs of claims
received.  As of September 23, 1994, 3,005 proofs of claims had been filed
against the Company which had not been withdrawn and which had a stated
aggregate value of approximately $357.4 million for the proofs of claim
specifying amounts; numerous other proofs of claim do not specify amounts.  Of
the total, 2,939 claims valued at $293.5 million had been accepted for
settlement by the Company.  The remaining number of claims includes other
unresolved claims, including duplicate claims filed by the same claimant and
also includes duplicate claims filed by separate parties for the same asserted
liability.  The Debtor Group considers the amounts claimed in the remaining
unsettled proofs of claim to be an unreliable estimate of their liability.  In
the opinion of management, certain of these claims assert unrealistic amounts
of liability, are duplicate claims or have other defects.  Consequently, as of
September 23, 1994, the Debtor Group is continuing to prosecute objections in
the Bankruptcy Court for 15 of the remaining disputed claims covering $22.9
million.  Of the disputed claims, $6.3 million is the amount the Company
estimates is not covered by insurance.  In addition, as of September 23, 1994,
49 claims for $37.1 million had been assigned to a mediation/settlement
procedure outlined in the Plan of Reorganization.  The Debtor Group will
continue to reconcile the scheduled claims with the claims asserted in proofs
of claims and will take appropriate steps to eliminate all duplications and
other inaccuracies to ensure that only valid claims are allowed by the
Bankruptcy Court.  This process will continue until all claims are resolved and
is expected to last for an extended period of time.





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   17
The majority of outstanding disputed claims are general unsecured claims.
Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, a total of 1,616,559
shares of Common Stock were issued to Boatmen's Trust Company as agent for the
general unsecured creditors, pending allowance of their respective claims.  As
of September 20, 1994, Boatmen's had allocated 873,847 shares to individual
unsecured creditors and had issued the appropriate share certificates.  The
remaining 742,712 shares will be allocated in the future as additional general
unsecured claims are allowed.

On January 10, 1994, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement of the Proofs
of Claim of National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
and certain related entities ("National Union"), which settlement provided for
National Union to have an allowed general unsecured claim under the Plan of
Reorganization in the amount of $4,029,319, for the release of $4,494,152 in
Letters of Credit held by National Union and for the reissuance of Letters of
Credit totalling $9,591,925 to National Union.  The settlement also
contemplates the payment by National Union of certain proofs of claim by
claimants whose claims are covered by National Union insurance.  As a result of
the settlement with National Union, the amount of unresolved general unsecured
claims was substantially reduced.

On September 14, 1994, an Order of the Bankruptcy Court was entered approving a
settlement of the proofs of claim of the current lessors of the Debtors' home
office location.  The settlement provides for an aggregate allowed claim in the
amount of $3,516,989.  The settlement substantially reduced the amount of
unresolved general unsecured claims.  The amount originally claimed by these
lessors, excluding the potentially duplicate claims, was in excess of
$7,900,000.

OTHER LITIGATION

George Shields, Garry Cocker, Michael W. Armstrong & Sheila B. Armstrong, Joint
Tenants, Michael W. Armstrong & Sheila B. Armstrong Revocable Living Trust,
Bobby J. Moon, and Jeannie M. Moon, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, Plaintiffs v. V. H. Van Horn, Richard C. Steadman, Dunbar
N. Chambers, Jr., Raymond W. Oeland, Jr. and Robert Stobaugh, Defendants; in
the 125th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas (the "State Court
Action").  In this action, filed on February 24, 1993, the shareholder
Plaintiffs had sought class certification to assert claims by all shareholders
of the Company prior to the confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization.  The
Plaintiffs contended, among other things, that the write-offs which were taken
prior to the confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization were improper and that
the Plan of Reorganization, as approved by order of the Bankruptcy Court,
improperly deprived Plaintiffs of their ownership of the Company.  Plaintiffs
had sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and costs of defense.

The Company had filed an adversary proceeding against the
shareholders/Plaintiffs styled National Convenience Stores Incorporated v.
George Shields and Garry Cocker, in the Bankruptcy Court, Adversary No. 93-4454
(the "Adversary Proceeding").  The Company's complaint in the Adversary
Proceeding had requested that the Bankruptcy Court enforce its injunction
contained in the Order confirming the Plan of Reorganization since the
Adversary Proceeding, as a collateral attack upon the Order of Confirmation,
contradicts the Order of Confirmation.  On October 29, 1993, the Bankruptcy
Court entered judgment for the Company against Messrs. Shields and Cocker.  The
judgment enjoined Messrs.  Shields and Cocker from prosecuting the State Court
Action and ordered Messrs. Shields and Cocker to dismiss the State Court
Action.  The judgment was appealed by Messrs. Shields and Cocker to the United
States

District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.

The Company had filed a further action in Bankruptcy Court against Messrs.
Shields and Cocker styled National Convenience Stores Incorporated v. Shields
and Cocker, Adversary No. 93-4705 (the "Compensation Lawsuit") in which the
Company sought compensation for costs incurred as a result of the violation of
the permanent injunction by the shareholder/Plaintiffs mentioned above.

The Directors, who are Defendants in the State Court Action, and the Company
entered into a settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs, in the State Court
Action, and Messrs. Shields and Cocker with respect to the State Court Action,
the Adversary Proceeding and the Compensation Lawsuit.  Under the terms of the
settlement agreement, the Plaintiffs, in the State Court Action, and Messrs
Shields and Cocker agreed (i) to release each of their claims against the
Directors who are Defendants and the Company; (ii) to dismiss the State Court
Action; (iii) to sell any shares of Company stock owned; (iv) not to purchase
any Company stock for ten years; and (v) to pay the Company $1,000.  The
Company agreed to dismiss the Adversary Proceeding and the Compensation
Lawsuit.  The State Court Action, the Appeal of the Adversary Proceeding and
the Compensation Lawsuit have been dismissed.

There is no other litigation pending or threatened against the Company that
management believes would have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or the business of the Company.  See, however, Item 1
"Business--Regulatory Matters" for information relating to the Company's
potential litigation exposure as a retailer of alcoholic beverages and
gasoline.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1994.

(1)  During the year ended June 30, 1987, the predecessor company issued
     floating interest rate subordinated debentures to all of its officers and
     directors and during the year ended June 30, 1989, the predecessor company
     issued floating interest rate subordinated debentures to those officers
     currently employed with the predecessor company who had not been issued
     debentures during the year ended June 30, 1987.  The purchases of both
     issuances of debentures were financed pursuant to promissory notes payable
     executed by such officers and directors.  As a result of the ratification
     of the 1989 Equity Incentive Plan on October 25, 1989, no additional
     debentures were allowed to be issued thereafter.  During fiscal 1992,
     certain officers and directors of the predecessor company exercised their
     right to exchange the outstanding $5,448,000 of promissory notes payable
     held by the predecessor company for the related floating interest rate
     subordinated debentures.

(2)  For financial reporting purposes, the Company wrote off the Employee Stock
     Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") receivable upon emerging from Chapter 11
     bankruptcy reorganization and adopting "fresh-start reporting" as set
     forth in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement
     of Position 90-7 "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
     the Bankruptcy Code".  Concurrently with emergence from Chapter 11
     bankruptcy reorganization, the Company proposed termination of the ESOP
     and filed for a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax
     consequences of the proposed termination of the ESOP.  To date the Company
     has not received such ruling.

(3)  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 the Company extended a three-year
     $300,000 unsecured loan with interest payable at 8 1/2% annually to Mr. V.
     H. Van Horn, who serves as a director and as President and Chief Executive
     Officer of the Company.  The loan is payable in 35 monthly installments of
     $2,500 of principal and interest and a final payment of the then unpaid
     principal and interest.  The terms of the loan also require that any bonus
     compensation earned by Mr. V. H. Van Horn while the loan is outstanding be
     applied as a mandatory prepayment of the loan.

further amended by adding thereto the following new clauses (i) through (m):

                          (i)     Promptly upon becoming aware of any Material

                 notice thereof.

                          (k)     The Borrower shall comply, and shall cause

                 provisions of the Leases and shall maintain, and cause each
                 Guarantor Subsidiary to maintain, the Leases in full force and
                 effect.  The Borrower shall not permit, or allow any Guarantor
                 Subsidiary to permit, any of the Leases to be terminated.  The
                 Borrower shall maintain, and shall cause each Guarantor

                 the covenants in this Section 5.21(k) are given and made only
                 to the extent that the failure to comply with any such
                 covenant or covenants would not materially adversely affect

                 results of operations of the Borrower and the Consolidated

                          terms and conditions:

                                  (A)      Borrower and its Subsidiaries may

                          Person other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
                          would result in a net reduction of twenty-five (25)
                          or more stores of the Borrower or any subsidiary in

                          exceeds $250,000, then, in each instance, such assets
                          may not be sold without the prior written consent of
                          the Majority Banks; and

                          exceeds $250,000, the asset or group of assets may
                          not be sold without the prior written consent of the
                          Majority Banks; and

                                  (C)      all such sales shall be for cash;

                          (c)     Amounts payable by any Person to Borrower or
                 any Guarantor Subsidiary hereunder, shall be paid by such
                 Person for the account of Borrower or such Subsidiary (i) in
                 the case of any purchasers affiliated with the Borrower or any
                 Subsidiary or in the case of the sale of any Real Estate, in
                 escrow to an escrow agent designated by the Agent (or, in the
                 case of any sale of Real Estate, the applicable title
                 company), and shall be held in escrow by such escrow agent (or
                 title company, as the case may be) on terms satisfactory to
                 the Agent until such time as consummation of the transaction
                 in respect of which such funds have been delivered into escrow
                 has occurred, and immediately thereupon Net Cash Proceeds
                 payable to the Banks shall be transferred to the Agent, by
                 wire transfer, in accordance with instructions given to such
                 escrow agent (or title company, as the case may be) by the
                 Agent, and (ii) in the case of any other purchaser or the sale
                 of any other assets, any such Net Cash Proceeds payable to the
                 Banks under this Section 5.22 shall be immediately transferred
                 to the Agent, by wire transfer, in accordance with
                 instructions given to such purchaser by the Agent.  The
                 Borrower and each Subsidiary shall take all action and do all

                 any Subsidiary of any property or other assets securing the
                 Obligations, and provided that no Event of Default has
                 occurred which has not been waived by the Majority Banks in
                 accordance with the terms hereof, the Agent may, and at the
                 instruction of the Majority Banks shall, execute and deliver
                 to the Borrower or such Subsidiary duly executed releases, or

                 the Agent and the Borrower.

                          (e)     If at any time any payment by the Borrower or
                 any Subsidiary of Net Cash Proceeds to any Bank is annulled,

                 continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be,
                 all as though such payment or payments had not been made.

                 2.24.    Section 5.23 of the Credit Agreement is hereby
deleted therefrom in its entirety and the following new Section 5.23 is hereby
inserted in lieu thereof:

                          SECTION 5.23.  Intercreditor Agreement.  The Agent
                 acknowledges that it has delivered to the Borrower on or
                 before the Closing Date an executed copy of the Intercreditor
                 Agreement, as in effect on the Closing Date.  The Borrower
                 acknowledges having received a copy of such Intercreditor
                 Agreement, and hereby consents and agrees that (i) payments,
                 prepayments and proceeds may be shared between the Banks and
                 Bank of America pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and
                 (ii) prepayments to be made hereunder pursuant to clauses (a),
                 (c) and (d) of Section 2.08 hereof shall be made in accordance
                 with Exhibit 2.08 hereto in the amounts and manner necessary
                 or desirable to facilitate the sharing of payments between the
                 Banks and Bank of America under the Intercreditor Agreement.
                 The Agent agrees to provide to the Borrower a copy of each
                 amendment or modification to the Intercreditor Agreement
                 executed from and after the Closing Date; provided that, the
                 failure of the Agent to deliver any such amendment or
                 modification shall in no event release the Borrower or any
                 Subsidiary from its obligations hereunder or any other Loan
                 Document, or in any way be deemed or construed to diminish or
                 modify, subject to Exhibit 2.08, the Borrower's or such
                 Subsidiary's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
                 Document.

                 2.25.    Section 5.24 of the Credit Agreement is amended by
inserting the following new clause (a) therein and redesignating the present
clause (a) as clause (b):

                          (a)     After the Closing Date, neither the Borrower
                 nor any Subsidiary shall change the date on which any of the
                 Fiscal Quarters shall end.  The Borrower shall make no
                 significant change in its accounting practices except as

                 as the same shall become due and payable in the ordinary
                 course of business in accordance with past practices, unless
                 the same (other than Debt for borrowed money) are being

                 any Subsidiary is obligated to pay, which are due and which,
                 if unpaid, might by operation of law or otherwise become a
                 Lien (other than a Lien permitted under Section 5.13) upon its
                 property; and

                 which a bona fide dispute may exist, and

                          (b)     as to which such failure to comply would not
                 have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
                 properties, assets or financial condition of the Borrower and
                 its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                 the aggregate; (iii) amend the Bank of America Agreement or
                 other Bank of America Credit Documents or enter into any
                 additional agreements with Bank of America without the prior
                 written consent of the Banks if such amendment or additional
                 agreement would (A) impose additional material conditions to
                 the obligation of Bank of America to make loans and/or issue
                 letters of credit pursuant to the Bank of America Agreement,
                 (B) require or permit the Borrower to grant liens to secure

                 the Bank of America Agreement, (D) restrict the ability of the
                 Borrower or any Subsidiary to pay Net Cash Proceeds or any

                 Agreement or the Revolving Credit Agreement, (E) contravene,
                 or cause a default under, this Agreement, the Loan Documents
                 or the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Credit Documents
                 executed in connection therewith, or (F) waive (or modify so
                 as to make less stringent) the obligation of the Borrower to
                 pay or to provide cash collateral as provided in Section 2.16
                 of this Agreement; or (iv) incur indebtedness to refinance or
                 refund in whole or in part obligations to Bank of America
                 under the Bank of America Agreement unless the holder of such
                 indebtedness enters into an intercreditor agreement with the
                 Banks in the form of the Intercreditor Agreement then in
                 effect.

                 and any and all other agreements entered into with or for the
                 benefit of Bank of America, in each instance promptly upon the

                 agreements, and satisfy every condition, contained in the Plan
                 of Reorganization to be observed, performed or satisfied by

                          SECTION 5.32.  Subordination of Intercompany Loans
                 and Advances to the Borrower.  The Borrower and each
                 Subsidiary shall cause any Debt owed by the Borrower or such
                 Subsidiary to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary or any
                 Affiliate to be subordinated to Debt of the Borrower and each

                 with any Affiliate, or any holder of five percent (5%) or more
                 of any class of equity securities of the Borrower or such
                 Subsidiary or Affiliates, or with any Affiliate of any such
                 holder, whether or not in the ordinary course of business, on
                 terms that are less favorable to the Borrower or any such
                 Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those terms which might
                 be obtained at the time from Persons who are not such a holder
                 or Affiliate, or if such transaction





                                      -23-

                 respect (a) any of their certificates or articles of

                 (except for such amendments as are being made in connection
                 with the Plan of Reorganization), unless such amendment would
                 not have a Material Adverse Effect, without in each case

                 Credit Documents and other documents executed from time to
                 time in connection therewith, which restricts or limits its

                 Agreement, the Original Credit Agreement or any other Loan
                 Document, this Section 9.15 shall remain in full force and

                 (a)      the sum of the following contributions paid under the
         Plan on behalf of each such Eligible Employee for such Plan Year

                          (i)     Employer Matching Contributions or any other
                 matching contributions that are not Qualified Nonelective
                 Contributions;
                                         
                     (ii)         any After-Tax Employee Contributions
                 (including any Excess Contributions that are recharacterized
                 pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 3.5 of the

        such Plan Year.
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                      -3-
                                         
<PAGE>   11

For purposes of subsection (a)(i) above, "matching contribution" shall mean (I)
any Employer contribution made to the Plan on behalf of an Eligible Employee on
account of an After-Tax Employee Contribution made by such employee, (II) any
Employer contribution made to the Plan on behalf of an Eligible Employee on
account of such Employee's Deferral Contribution, and (III) any forfeitures
allocated on the basis of After-Tax Employee Contributions, Deferral
Contributions or matching contributions.

         With respect to any Highly Compensated Eligible Employee who is
eligible to participate in two or more plans of the Company or an Affiliated
Company to which matching contributions, employee contributions or both are
made, all such contributions on behalf of such Highly Compensated Eligible
Employee must be aggregated for purposes of determining such Employee's Actual
Contribution Percentage.

         1.4     "Actual Deferral Percentage" means, with respect to a
specified group of Eligible Employees for each Plan Year, the average of the 
ratios (expressed as a percentage, rounded off to the nearest one-hundredth
percent) calculated separately for each Eligible Employee in such group of:

                 (a)      the amount of Deferral Contributions (including any
         Excess Deferrals as defined in Article III, Section 3.7 of the Plan
         and paid under the Plan), and any Qualified Nonelective Contributions
         on behalf of each such Eligible Employee for such Plan Year;

to

                 (b)      the Eligible Employee's Considered Compensation for 
         such Plan Year.

With respect to any Highly Compensated Eligible Employee who participates in
two or more cash or deferred arrangements of the 
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                      -4-
                                         
<PAGE>   12

Company or Affiliated Company, this ratio shall be calculated by treating all
such cash or deferred arrangements as one cash or deferred arrangement.  The
actual deferral ratio of an Eligible Employee, with respect to whom neither a
Deferral Contribution nor a Qualified Nonelective Contribution is made, is zero.

         For the purpose of determining the Actual Deferral Percentage of a
Highly Compensated Eligible Employee who is subject to the family aggregation
rules of Code Section 414(q)(6) because such Member is either a "five percent
owner" of the Company or one of the ten (10) Highly Compensated Eligible
Employees paid the greatest amount of compensation (as defined under Code
Section 415) during the Plan Year, the following shall apply:

                 (1)      The combined Actual Deferral Percentage for the
         family group (which shall be treated as one Highly Compensated
         Eligible Employee) shall be the greater of:  (i) the Actual Deferral
         Percentage determined by  aggregating elective contributions,
         compensation (as defined in Code Section 414(s)), and amounts treated
         as elective contributions of all eligible Family Members who are Highly
         Compensated Eligible Employees without regard to family aggregation;
         and (ii) the Actual Deferral Percentage determined by aggregating
         elective contributions, compensation (as defined in Code Section
         414(s)), and amounts treated as elective contributions of all eligible
         Family Members (including Highly Compensated Eligible Employees). 
         However, in applying the $200,000 limit to compensation (as defined in
         Code Section 414(s)), Family Members shall include only the affected
         Employee's spouse and any lineal descendants who have not attained age
         nineteen (19) before the close of the Plan Year.
        
                 (2)      Elective contributions, compensation (as defined in
         Code Section 414(s)), and amounts treated as elective contributions of
         all Family Members shall be disregarded for purposes of determining
         the Actual Deferral Percentage of the non-Highly Compensated Eligible
         Employee group except to the extent taken into account in paragraph
         (1) above.

                 (3)      If an employee is required to be aggregated as a
         member of more than one family group in a plan, all 
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                      -5-
                                         
<PAGE>   13
         Eligible Employees who are members of those family groups that include
         the employee are aggregated as one family group in accordance with 
         paragraphs (1) and (2) above.

                 (4)      Except as provided in paragraph (1) above, "Family
         Member" means, with respect to an affected Member, such Member's
         spouse, such Member's lineal descendants and ascendants and their
         spouses, as described in Code Section 414(q)(6)(B).

Paragraphs (1) through (4) above shall be administered in accordance with
Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(g)(3)(C) or its successor.

         Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Employer Matching
Contributions may be treated as Deferral Contributions for purposes of
determining a Member's Actual Deferral Percentage only if such Qualified
Nonelective Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions (1) are 
nonforfeitable when made, and (2) are subject to the same distribution
restrictions that apply to Deferral Contributions, without regard to whether
they are actually taken into account as Deferral Contributions for such
purpose.  Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Employer Matching
Contributions may be treated as Deferral Contributions only if the conditions
described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(b)(5) or its successor are
satisfied.

         1.5     "Administrative Committee" means the committee appointed by
the Company to administer the Plan and shall generally be referred to
hereinafter as the "Committee."

         1.6     "Affiliated Company" means a corporation which would be a
subsidiary in the Company's "parent-subsidiary controlled group" within the
meaning of Section 1563(a)(1) of the Code except that "more than 50 percent"
shall be substituted for "at least 80 percent" each time therein.
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                      -6-
                                         
<PAGE>   14

         1.7     "After-Tax Employee Contribution" means the amount each
Participant elects to have the Signatory Company pay to the Trustee on behalf
of such Participant pursuant to Article III, Section 3.4 of this Plan.

         1.8     "Aggregate Account" means, with respect to each Member, the
value of the Account maintained on behalf of such Member, including all amounts
attributable to Deferral Contributions, Employer Contributions, Employer
Matching Contributions and any After-Tax Employee Contributions.
                                         
         1.9     "Annual Additions" means the sum credited to a Member's
Account for any "limitation year" of (1) Employer contributions, (2) employee
contributions as determined under Sections 415(c)(2), 415(l) and 419A(d)(2) of
the Code, (3) forfeitures, if any, (4) amounts allocated, after March 31, 1984,
to an individual medical account as defined in Section 415(l)(1) of the Code
which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the Employer and (5)
amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after December 31, 1985, in
taxable years ending after such date, which are attributable to post-retirement
medical benefits allocated to the separate account of a key employee (as
defined in Section 419A(d)(3) of the Code) under a welfare benefit plan (as
defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) maintained by the Employer. The 
percentage limitation referred to in Article V, Section 5.1(b) hereof shall 
not apply to:  (1) any contribution for medical benefits (within the meaning 
of Section 419A(f)(2) of the Code) after separation from service which is 
otherwise treated as an 
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                      -7-
                                         
<PAGE>   15

"Annual Addition", or (2) any amount otherwise treated as an "Annual Addition"
under Section 415(l)(1) of the Code.

         1.10    "Authorized Leave of Absence" means the following periods of
absence with respect to which the Employee is not treated by his Employer as

payroll of the Employer and does not receive Considered Compensation:
                                         
                 (a)      Absence due to accident, sickness or pregnancy as
         long as the Employee is continued on the employment rolls of the
         Signatory Company and remains eligible to return to work upon his
         recovery;

                 (b)      Absence due to membership in the armed forces of the
         United States (but if such absence is not pursuant to orders issued by
         the armed forces of the United States, only if with the consent of the
         Signatory Company) provided that each such Employee shall apply for
         reinstatement in the employment of the Signatory Company within ninety
         (90) days after honorable discharge or after release to inactive duty,
         as the case may be; or

                 (c)      Absence due to an approved leave of absence granted
         by a Signatory Company pursuant to established practices applied in a
         consistent and nondiscriminatory manner, provided each such Employee
         shall, prior to the expiration of such leave of absence, apply for
         reinstatement in the employment of the Signatory Company.

         1.11    "Beneficiary" or "Beneficiaries" means such natural person or
persons, or trustee of a trust for the benefit of a natural person or persons,
as may be determined pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, Section 6.2
hereof.  For purposes of determining whether the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, a
Beneficiary of a deceased Member shall be considered as either a Key Employee
or a Non-Key Employee, depending upon whether such deceased Member was
classified as a Key Employee or Non-Key Employee.

         1.12    "Break-in-Service" with respect to an Employee means any Plan
Year during which such Employee completes five hundred (500)

or fewer Hours of Service.  Solely for the purpose of determining whether a
Member has incurred a one-year Break-in- Service, Hours of Service shall be
recognized for "maternity and paternity leaves of absence."  A "maternity or
paternity leave of absence" shall mean an absence from work for any period by
reason of the Employee's pregnancy, birth of the Employee's child, placement of
a child with the Employee in connection with the adoption of such child, or any
absence for the purpose of caring for such child for a period immediately
following such birth or placement.  For this purpose, Hours of Service shall be
credited for the computation period in which the absence from work begins, only
if credit therefore is necessary to prevent the Employee from incurring a
one-year Break-in-Service, or, in any other case, in the immediately following
computation period.  The Hours of Service credited for a "maternity or paternity
leave of absence" shall be those which would normally have been credited but for
such absence, or, in any case in which the Committee is unable to determine such
hours normally credited, eight (8) Hours of Service per day. The total Hours of
Service required to be credited for a "maternity or paternity leave of absence"
shall not exceed Five Hundred One (501).  No Hours of Service will be credited
for a "maternity or paternity leave of absence" unless the Employee furnishes to
the Committee such timely information as it may reasonably require to

Eligible Employee who performed services for the Employer during the
"determination year" and is in one or more of the following groups:

                 (a)      during the "determination year" or "look-back year"
         was a five-percent owner of the Employer, as defined in Section 416 of
         the Code and the regulations issued thereunder;

                 (b)      received compensation during the "look-back year"
         from the Employer in excess of $75,000 (or such other amount in effect

         from the Employer in excess of $50,000 (or such other amount in effect
         under Section 414(q)(1)(C) of the Code) and was in the top-paid group
         of employees for such Plan Year.  An Employee is in the "top-paid
         group" of employees for any Plan Year if such Employee is in the group
         consisting of the top twenty percent (20%) of Employees when
         ranked on the basis of compensation paid during such Plan Year.  For
         purposes of determining the "top-paid group" of Employees for any Plan
         Year, Section 414(q)(8) of the Code and Q & A 9(b) of Treas. Reg.
         Section 1.414(q)-1T shall apply to exclude certain employees; or

                 (d)      was during the "look-back year" an officer of the
         Employer (as defined in Section 416 of the Code and the regulations
         issued thereunder) and received compensation greater than fifty
         percent (50%) of the limit in effect under Section 415(b)(1)(A) for
         such Plan Year.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for purposes
         of this subsection (d) the following rules shall apply:

                          (1)     the number of officers taken into account 
                 for any year shall not exceed the lesser of

                                  (A)      fifty (50) employees; or

                                  (B)      the greater of three (3) employees 
                          or ten percent (10%) of employees; and

                          (2)     if no officer of the Employer received
                 compensation greater than fifty percent (50%) of the amount in
                 effect under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code for such Plan
                 Year, then the highest paid officer of the Employer shall be
                 treated as having received such amount of compensation; and

                          (3)     for the purpose of determining the number of
                 officers, Employees described in Section 414(q)(8) of the Code
                 shall be excluded, but such Employees shall still be
                 considered for the purpose of identifying the particular
                 Employees who are officers.

                 (e)      was in the group consisting of the one hundred (100)
         Eligible Employees paid the greatest compensation during the
         "determination year" and would also be described in (b), (c) or (d)
         above, after modifying these paragraphs by substituting "determination
         year" for "look-back year."

The "determination year" shall be the Plan Year for which testing is being
performed, and the "look-back year" shall be the immediately preceding
twelve-month period or (if the Employer elects pursuant to Q & A 14 of Treas.
Reg. Section 1.414(q)-1T) the calendar ending with or within the determination
year.  For purposes of this Section 1.30, "compensation" shall be defined under
Section 414(q)(7) of the Code and the regulations thereunder and shall mean
compensation under Section 415(c)(3) of the Code and regulations thereunder
which is actually paid and shall include amounts that would otherwise be
excluded from gross income under Sections 125, 402(a)(8), 402(h)(1)(B) and
403(b) of the Code.

         There will be attributed to any five percent (5%) owner or any of the
ten (10) most highly compensated Eligible Employees any compensation paid to,
contributions made by or on behalf of, or benefits provided for any family
member of such five percent (5%) owner or highly compensated Eligible Employee,
pursuant to Section 414(q)(6) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
"Family Member" for purposes of the preceding sentence means the spouse and the
lineal ascendants and descendants (and spouses of such ascendants and
descendants) of any employee or former employee.  A 





                                     -15-

<PAGE>   23

former employee shall be treated as a Highly Compensated Eligible Employee if
such former employee was a Highly Compensated Eligible Employee as defined
herein at the time he separated from service or at any time after attaining age
fifty-five (55).  Except as provided by Section 416(i)(1)(C) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder, an Employee's status as a Highly Compensated Eligible
Employee is to be determined by reference to the controlled group of
corporations as provided in Section 414(b) of the Code, and employers aggregated
under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) are treated as a single employer.

         Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, an Employee who was not a
Highly Compensated Eligible Employee, as defined in subsections (b), (c) or
(d), for the immediately preceding Plan Year shall not be treated as a Highly
Compensated Eligible Employee, as defined in subsections (b), (c) or (d), for
the current Plan Year unless such Employee is a member of the group consisting
of the one hundred (100) Employees paid the highest Considered Compensation
during the current Plan Year.

         1.31    "Hour of Service" means a time of service determined under
regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.  For purposes of this
determination, "Hours of Service" shall include each hour for which an Employee
is directly or indirectly paid by the Signatory Company for performance of
duties and for reasons other than performance of duties such as vacation,
holidays, sickness, disability, lay-off, jury duty, and similar paid periods;
and each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, has
been either awarded or agreed to by a Signatory 





                                     -16-

<PAGE>   24

Company.  All "Hours of Service" shall be credited to the Employee for the
computation period or periods in which the duties were performed or, in cases
where the Employee is paid for reasons other than the performance of duties,
pursuant to the procedures outlined in Department of Labor Regulation Section
2530.200b-2(b) and (c); provided, however, where back pay has been either
awarded or agreed to by the Signatory Company, such hours shall be credited to
the Employee for the computation period or periods to which the award or
agreement pertains rather than the computation period in which the award,
agreement or payment is made.

         Hours of Service shall be determined for all purposes under the Plan
on the basis of hours worked.  Each Employee shall be credited with 45 Hours of
Service for each week for which such Employee would otherwise have been
credited with at least one Hour of Service under this Section 1.31.

         1.32    "Key Employee" means any Employee or former Employee (and any
Beneficiary of a Employee or former Employee) who, at any time during the Plan
Year or any of the preceding four (4) Plan Years, is:

                 (a)      an officer of the employer (as defined in Section 416
         of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder) having annual
         compensation greater than fifty percent (50%) of the amount in effect
         under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code for any such Plan Year.  Only
         incorporated employers will be considered as having officers;

                 (b)      one of the ten Employees owning (or considered as
         owning within the meaning of Section 318 of the Code) (i) more than
         one-half percent (0.5%) interest and (ii) the largest interests
         in all employers required to be aggregated under Code Sections 414(b),
         414(c), and 414(m).  However, an Employee shall not be considered a top
         ten owner for a Plan Year under the preceding sentence if the Employee
         earns less than $30,000 in 





                                     -17-

<PAGE>   25

         annual compensation (or such other amount adjusted in accordance
         with Section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code) as in effect for the calendar
         year in which the Determination Date falls.  For this purpose, if two
         Employees have the same such interest, the Employee having the greater
         Considered Compensation shall be treated as having the larger interest;

                 (c)       a "five percent owner" of the employer.  For this
         purpose, "five percent owner" means any person who owns (or is
         considered as owning within the meaning of Section 318 of the Code)
         more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of the employer
         or stock possessing more than five percent (5%) of the total combined
         voting power of all stock of the employer.  In determining the
         ownership percentage, employers which would otherwise be aggregated
         under Sections 414(b), 414(c) and 414(m) of the Code shall be treated
         as separate employers; or

                 (d)      a "one percent owner" of the employer having an
         annual compensation from the employer of more than $150,000.  For this
         purpose, "one percent owner" means any person who owns (or is
         considered owning within the meaning of Section 318 of the Code) more
         than one percent (1%) of the outstanding stock of the employer or
         stock possessing more than one percent (1%) of the total combined
         voting power of all stock of the employer.  In determining the
         ownership percentage, the employers which would otherwise be
         aggregated under Sections 414(b), 414(c), and 414(m) of the Code shall
         be treated as separate employers.  However, in determining whether an
         individual has compensation of more than $150,000, compensation from
         each employer required to be aggregated under Sections 414(b), 414(c)
         and 414(m) of the Code shall be aggregated.

         In addition, for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1984, if a
Member or Former Member has not performed any services for any Employer
maintaining the Plan at any time during the five (5) year period ending on the
Determination Date, the Aggregate Account for such Member or Former Member shall
not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is a
Top Heavy or Super Top Heavy Plan under Article X, Section 10.1 or 10.2.

                          registered with the Securities and Exchange
                          Commission; or

                                  (B)      If the obligation is not traded on
                          such a national securities exchange, at a price not
                          less favorable to the Plan than the offering price
                          for the obligation as established by current bid and
                          asked prices quoted by persons independent of the
                          issuer;

                          (2)     From an underwriter, at a price

                          price for the obligation as set forth in a prospectus
                          or offering circular filed with the Securities and
                          Exchange Commission; and

                          (3)     Directly from the issuer, at a price not less

                                  ARTICLE II.

                       Employees Entitled to Participate

         2.1     Eligibility to Participate.  Every Employee shall become a
Participant of the Plan on the Entry Date next following the completion of one
(1) Year of Service with a Signatory Company.  The Committee may require any
Participant to execute application forms, but the execution of such forms shall
not be a condition precedent to participation in the Plan.  A Participant's
election to make Deferral Contributions under this Plan shall in no way be made
a direct or indirect condition of any other benefit provided by the Employer to
such Participant under this or any other plan or arrangement.  The preceding
sentence shall not apply to any Employer Matching Contribution made by reason
of such election.

         2.2     Participation Status.  In the event that any Participant shall
fail, in any Plan Year of his employment after the Effective Date, to
accumulate one thousand (1,000) Hours of Service but does not incur a one (1)

case, such Plan Year shall not 





                                     -23-

<PAGE>   31

be considered as a Year of Service for the purpose of determining the
Participant's vested interest in accordance with Article VII hereof and the
Participant shall not share in any Employer Contributions or Forfeitures for any
such Plan Year, but he shall continue to receive income allocations and
valuation adjustments in accordance with Article IV, Sections 4.6 and 4.7, and 
shall continue to have the right to elect to make After-Tax Employee
Contributions, Deferral Contributions and receive Employer Matching
Contributions in accordance with Article III, Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 until
his employment terminates as described in the following paragraph.  In the event
such Participant accumulates one thousand (1,000) Hours of Service in a
subsequent Plan Year, his Account shall revert to active status with full rights
and benefits under this Plan restored.

         In the event a Participant terminates employment for any reason, such
Participant shall (to the extent previously eligible):

                 (a)      share in any Employer Matching Contributions through
         the date of his termination of employment,

                 (b)      continue to receive income allocations and valuation
         adjustments on the amount in his Account pursuant to Article IV,
         Sections 4.6 and 4.7 after his termination of employment until the
         complete distribution of his Account pursuant to Article IX hereof,
         and

                 (c)      continue to have the right to elect to make Deferral
         Contributions in accordance with Article III, Section 3.1 until the
         date of his termination of employment.

         2.3     Participation and Service Upon Reemployment.  Participation in
the Plan shall cease upon termination of employment with the Signatory Company.
Termination of employment may result from retirement, death, disability,
voluntary or involuntary termination 





                                     -24-

<PAGE>   32

of employment, unauthorized absence, or by failure to return to active
employment with the Signatory Company by the date on which an Authorized Leave
of Absence expires.

         Upon the reemployment of any person who had previously been employed
by the Signatory Company, the following rules shall apply in determining his
participation in the Plan:

                 (a)      If the reemployed Employee was not a Participant of
         the Plan during his prior period of employment, he must meet the
         service requirements of Section 2.1 for participation in the Plan as
         if he were a new Employee; provided, however, that if such Employee
         failed to incur a Break-in-Service prior to his reemployment
         commencement date, the eligibility computation period for such
         reemployed Employee shall be the initial period beginning with the
         Employee's employment commencement date and not the date of his
         reemployment.

                 (b)      If the reemployed Employee had previously satisfied
         the requirements of Section 2.1 and had been a Participant in the Plan
         prior to his termination of employment, he shall become a Participant
         on his reemployment commencement date if:

                          (i)     such reemployed Employee had any vested
                 interest (greater than zero) in the portion of his Account
                 attributable to Employer Contributions and Employer Matching
                 Contributions, or

                          (ii)    such reemployed Employee's number of
                 consecutive one-year Breaks in Service incurred prior to his
                 reemployment is less than the greater of 5 or his aggregate
                 Years of Service before the break in service.

                 (c)      If the reemployed Employee had no vested interest 
         (i.e., had been zero vested) in the portion of his Account attributable
         to Employer Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions prior to
         his termination of employment, he then shall be required to meet the
         service requirements of Section 2.1 for participation in the Plan as if
         he were a new Employee, if his number of consecutive one-year Breaks in
         Service incurred prior to his reemployment equal or exceed the greater
         of 5 or his aggregate Years of Service before the break in service.

<PAGE>   33

For purposes of this section, an Employee's employment commencement date shall
be the date he first performs an Hour of Service for the Signatory Company and
his reemployment commencement date shall be the date he first performs an Hour
of Service upon reemployment with the Signatory Company.

         2.4     Full Participation.  A Participant who completes both a Year
of Service and is in employment on the last day of the Plan Year shall
participate fully in the Plan for such Plan Year with respect to Employer
Contributions and Forfeitures.  Employment on the last day of the Plan Year or
completion of a Year of Service shall not be required in order for a
Participant to continue to participate in the Plan for such Plan Year for
purposes of making Deferral Contributions, After-Tax Employee Contributions or
receiving Employer Matching Contributions, income allocations and valuation
adjustments for such Plan Year.  However, except to the extent otherwise
provided in this Plan, any Participant who fails to both remain in employment
until the last day of the Plan Year and complete a Year of Service shall not be
eligible to participate in the Plan for such Plan Year for purposes of sharing
in Employer Contributions and Forfeitures.  As long as a terminated
Participant's Account remains in the Plan such Participant's Account shall be
credited with income allocations and valuation adjustments.  A Participant who
is not eligible to "fully participate" in the Plan within the meaning of this
Section 2.4, shall nonetheless have the right to elect to make Deferral
Contributions, After-Tax Employee Contributions and receive Employer Matching
Contributions.

         2.5     Transferred Employee.  An Employee's status as either an
Employee, Eligible Employee or a Participant shall not be deemed to be
interrupted or severed by the fact that he is transferred from the employ of
one Signatory Company to that of any other Signatory Company or performs
services for more than one Signatory Company.

         2.6     Certification.  Eligibility shall be determined by the
Committee, based upon information furnished by the Signatory Company.

         2.7     Notice to Employees.  The Committee shall notify each Employee
of his eligibility to participate a reasonable time prior to the Entry Date on
which he will become an Eligible Employee under Section 2.1 hereof, and each
such notice shall be accompanied by an enrollment form and a description of the
Plan written in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the
Employee.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                 Contributions

         3.1     Deferral Contributions.  For each Plan Year beginning with the
first Plan Year with respect to which this Plan is adopted by a Signatory
Company, each Participant employed by such Signatory Company may elect to have
allocated to his Account as a Deferral Contribution any whole percentage from
one percent (1%) to ten percent (10%) of his Considered Compensation for the
Plan Year; provided, however, that the Committee in its discretion may limit
the percentage deferred by any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Eligible
Employee.  The Deferral Contribution shall be paid through payroll deductions
of the applicable percentage by the 





                                     -27-

<PAGE>   35

Signatory Company, and the compensation otherwise paid to the Participant shall
be reduced to the extent of such Deferral Contribution.

         The Participant may change his Deferral Contribution percentage by
filing the required form with the Committee at least 30 days before any Entry
Date, and the new amount of Deferral Contribution shall become effective as of
such Entry Date.

         Elections to make or change Deferral Contributions shall be in
writing, signed by the Participant, on such form or forms as the Committee
shall prescribe.  Upon termination of employment, the amount attributable to
the Deferral Contribution allocated to the Participant's Account shall be 
distributed pursuant to Article VII of this Plan.

         Each Participant's Deferral Contribution for a Plan Year under this
Plan shall be limited to $7,000 (as adjusted for the cost of living, or such
other amount provided in Section 402(g)(5) of the Code).  If a Participant's
total personal deferral contributions exceed $7,000 (as adjusted for the cost
of living, or such other amount provided in Section 402(g)(5) of the Code) in
any Plan Year the provisions of Article III, Section 3.7 hereof shall become
applicable.  The term "total personal deferral contributions" means the sum of
all Deferral Contributions and any other "elective deferrals" by an Eligible
Employee under any other cash or deferred arrangements or (qualified plan type)
elective deferral vehicle of the Employer or any other employer, subject to any
offset rules provided under the Code or regulations.





                                     -28-

<PAGE>   36

         No Deferral Contribution may be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether any other contributions under this Plan or any other plan
meet the requirements of Section 401(a) or Section 410(b) of the Code, or for
purposes of satisfying the ("top heavy") minimum allocation rules of Article X,
Section 10.6 of this Plan.  The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes
of determining whether a plan meets the percentage portion or average benefit
requirement of Section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code.

         3.2     Employer Matching Contributions.  Until modified as provided
below, for each Plan Year beginning with the Plan Year ending June 30, 1994,
each Signatory Company shall, subject to the limitations provided in this Plan,
contribute to the Trust, an Employer Matching Contribution equal to a one
hundred percent (100%) of each Participant's Deferral Contribution for such
Plan Year up to a maximum Deferral Contribution of three percent (3%) of each
such Participant's Considered Compensation.  The amount of the Employer
Matching Contribution can be prospectively changed at any time by a resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors, acting in its sole discretion, such change
to become effective on the first day of the first payroll period beginning in
the first month following the adoption of the Board of Directors' resolution.
Such resolution will be communicated to the Signatory Companies by the Company
and to the Participants by their respective Signatory Companies. Each Signatory
Company shall have the right to make a larger or additional Employer Matching
Contribution on behalf of Participants who are not Highly Compensated Eligible
Employees for the purpose of assuring the Plan's compliance with the Actual





                                     -29-

<PAGE>   37

Deferral Percentage Test of Section 3.5 of this Article III and the Actual
Contribution Percentage Test of Section 3.6 of this Article III, and such
additional Employer Matching Contribution for non- Highly Compensated Eligible
Employees shall be immediately and fully nonforfeitable and shall not be
subject to any vesting schedule in Article VII hereof.

         3.3     Employer Contributions.

         For each Plan Year beginning with the first Plan Year with respect to
which this Plan is adopted by a Signatory Company, such Signatory Company may,
subject to the limitations contained in Section 3.12 of this Article III,
contribute to the Trust, an Employer Contribution any amount determined by the
Board of Directors, acting in its sole discretion.  The amount of the Employer
Contribution for each Plan Year may be established by a resolution adopted by
the Board of Directors, acting in its sole discretion.  Such resolution will be
communicated to the Signatory Companies by the Company.

         3.4     After-Tax Employee Contributions.  For each Plan Year
beginning with the first Plan Year with respect to which this Plan is adopted
by a Signatory Company, each Participant employed by such Signatory Company may
elect to have allocated to his Account as an After-Tax Employee Contribution in
two percent (2%) increments from two percent (2%) to six percent (6%) of his
Considered Compensation for the Plan Year; provided, however, that the
Committee in its discretion may limit the percentage deferred by any
Participant who is a Highly Compensated Eligible Employee.  The After-Tax
Employee Contribution shall be paid through payroll 





                                     -30-

<PAGE>   38

deductions of the applicable percentage by the Signatory Company, and the
compensation otherwise paid to the Participant shall be reduced to the extent of
such After-Tax Employee Contribution.

         At the end of each payroll period under procedures adopted by the
Committee, the Signatory Company shall transfer the After-Tax Employee
Contributions to the Trustee and shall certify to the Committee the names of
the Employees, the names of the Participants, and the After-Tax Employee
Contribution amount for each Participant.  The Committee shall allocate the
After-Tax Employee Contribution made on behalf of a Participant directly to
such Participant's Account.  The Participant may change his After- Tax Employee
Contribution percentage by filing the required form with the Committee at least
thirty (30) days before any Entry Date, and the new After-Tax Employee
Contribution shall become effective as of such Entry Date.

         The Participant shall have the right to suspend his After-Tax Employee
Contribution at any time by giving a written notification to the Committee.
Such suspension shall become effective no later than the second payroll period
following the payroll period during which such notification is received by the
Committee.

         Elections to make After-Tax Employee Contributions, increase or
decrease After-Tax Employee Contributions, suspend After- Tax Employee
Contributions or resume After-Tax Employee Contributions shall be in writing,
signed by the Participant, on such form or forms as the Committee shall
prescribe.  Upon termination of employment, the amount attributable to the
After-Tax Employee Contribution allocated to the Participant's Account shall be





                                      -31-

<PAGE>   39
distributed pursuant to Article VII of this Plan.  The balance in each
Participant's After-Tax Employee Contribution Account shall be fully vested at
all times and shall not be subject to forfeiture for any reason.  A Participant
may elect to withdraw all or part of his After-Tax Employee Contributions from
his Account and the actual earnings thereon under Article VII, Section 7.9 of
this Plan.  If the Committee maintains sub-accounts with respect to After-Tax
Employee Contributions (and earnings thereon) which were made on or before a
specified date, a Participant shall be permitted to designate which sub-account
shall be the source for his withdrawal.

         3.5     Actual Deferral Percentage Test.  If for the Plan Year the
Actual Deferral Percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Eligible
Employees (based upon Eligible Employee participation elections) would be more
than the greater of:

                 (a)      the Actual Deferral Percentage of all other Eligible
         Employees multiplied by 1.25; or

                 (b)      the lesser of (i) two percentage (2%) points plus the
         Actual Deferral Percentage of all other Eligible Employees, or (ii)
         the Actual Deferral Percentage of all other Eligible Employees
         multiplied by two (2),

such Excess Contribution shall be corrected in the manner set forth below.  The
calculation described in the preceding sentence is referred to herein as the
"Actual Deferral Percentage Test."  The Committee may, in its discretion,
select either of the following methods of correction or any combination thereof
in any Plan Year:

                 (1)      The Excess Contributions (and income allocable
         thereto) may, if such Excess Contributions are designated by the
         Committee as distributions of Excess Contributions (and income), be
         distributed to the appropriate Highly Compensated Eligible Employees
         after the close of such Plan Year and within 12 months of the close of
         such Plan 





                                     -32-

<PAGE>   40

         Year.  The income allocable to Excess Contributions includes
         both income for the Plan Year for which the Excess Contributions were
         made and income for the period between the end of the Plan Year and the
         date of distribution, and will be calculated pursuant to Treas. Reg.
         Section 1.401(k)-1(f)(4). If feasible, the Committee shall in its sole
         discretion determine and distribute the amount of Excess Contributions
         within two and one-half (2 1/2) months after the end of the Plan Year. 
         The Committee may distribute Excess Contributions without regard to any
         notice or consent otherwise required under the Plan or Section
         411(a)(11) and Section 417 of the Code limiting distributions.  The
         amount of Excess Contributions for a Highly Compensated Eligible
         Employee for a Plan Year is to be determined by the following leveling
         method, under which the actual deferral ratio of the Highly Compensated
         Eligible Employee with the highest actual deferral ratio is reduced to
         the extent required to satisfy the Actual Deferral Percentage Test set
         forth above or cause such Highly Compensated Eligible Employee's actual
         deferral ratio to equal the ratio of the Highly Compensated Eligible
         Employee with the next highest actual deferral ratio.  This process
         must be repeated until the Actual Deferral Percentage Test is satisfied
         for such Plan Year. Except to the extent otherwise provided in
         regulations, both refunded Excess Deferrals and retained Excess
         Deferrals under Section 3.7 of this Article III are taken into account
         in determining a Participant's Actual Deferral Percentage for purposes
         of the above calculation.

                 (2)      The Excess Contributions may be recharacterized as
         After-Tax Employee Contributions in accordance with the provisions of
         Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)- 1(f)(3).  Recharacterized Excess
         Contributions remain subject to the nonforfeitability requirements and
         distribution limitations that apply to Deferral Contributions.  Excess
         Contributions will not be recharacterized with respect to a Highly 
         Compensated Eligible Employee to the extent that the recharacterized 
         amounts, in combination with after-tax employee contributions
         actually made by such Highly Compensated Eligible Employee, exceed the
         maximum amount of employee contributions (determined prior to the
         application of Code Section 401(m)(2)(A)) that such Highly Compensated
         Eligible Employee is permitted to make under the Plan in the absence of
         recharacterization.

         Deferral Contributions will be taken into account under the Actual
Deferral Percentage Test for a Plan Year only if such Deferral Contributions
are (a) allocated to the Eligible Employee as of a date within such Plan Year
and (b) relates to compensation 





                                     -33-

<PAGE>   41

payable with respect to such Plan Year.  For this purpose, (a) a Deferral
Contribution is considered allocated as of a date within a Plan Year if the
allocation is not contingent on participation or performance of services after
such date and the Deferral Contribution is actually paid to the Trust no later
than 12 months after the Plan Year to which the contribution relates, and (b)
compensation is payable with respect to a Plan Year only if either (i) it would
have been (but for the election to defer) received by the Participant in the
Plan Year, or (ii) is attributable to services performed in the Plan Year and
would have been (but for the election to defer) received by the Participant
within 2 1/2 months after the close of the Plan Year.

         In the case of a Highly Compensated Eligible Employee whose Actual
Deferral Percentage is determined under the family aggregation rules of Code 
Section 414(q)(6), the determination of the amount of Excess Contributions shall
be made as follows:

                 (3)      If the Highly Compensated Eligible Employee's Actual
         Deferral Percentage is determined under Article I, Section 1.4(1)(ii),
         then the Actual Deferral Percentage is reduced in accordance with the
         leveling method described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(f)(2) and
         the Excess Contributions for the family unit are allocated among the
         Family Participants in proportion to the elective contributions of
         each Family Participant that have been combined to determine the
         Actual Deferral Percentage.

                 (4)      If the Highly Compensated Eligible Employee's Actual
         Deferral Percentage is determined under Article I, Section 1.4(1)(i),
         then the Actual Deferral Percentage is reduced in accordance with the
         leveling method described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(f)(2) but
         not below the Actual Deferral Percentage of Family Participants who
         are Non-Highly Compensated Eligible Employees without regard to family
         aggregation.  Excess Contributions are determined by taking into
         account the contributions of the eligible Family Participants who are
         Highly Compensated Eligible Employees without regard to family
         aggregation, and are allocated among such Family Participants in
         proportion to 





                                     -34-

<PAGE>   42

         each such Family Participant's elective contributions. If further 
         reduction of the Actual Deferral Percentage is required, Excess
         Contributions resulting from this reduction are determined by taking
         into account the contributions of all eligible Family Participants and
         are allocated among such Family Participants in proportion to the
         elective contributions of each Family Participant.

Paragraphs (3) and (4) above shall be administered in accordance with Treas.
Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(f)(5)(ii).  It is intended that Excess Contributions
will be corrected in accordance with this Section 3.5 in a timely fashion to
avoid disqualification of the Plan or other sanction imposed under the Code
(including the imposition of tax under Code Section 4979).

         3.6     Actual Contribution Percentage Test.  If for the Plan Year the
Actual Contribution Percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Eligible
Employees would be more than the greater of:

                 (a)      the Actual Contribution Percentage for all other
         Eligible Employees multiplied by 1.25; or

                 (b)      the lesser of (i) the Actual Contribution Percentage
         for all other Eligible Employees plus two percentage (2%) points, or
         (ii) the Actual Contribution Percentage for all other Eligible
         Employees multiplied by two (2),

such Excess Aggregate Contributions, shall be corrected in the manner set forth
below.  The calculation described in the preceding sentence is referred to
herein as the "Actual Contribution Percentage Test."  The Excess Aggregate
Contributions (and income allocable thereto) shall be distributed to (or, if
forfeitable, in the discretion of the Committee uniformly applied, forfeited
by) Highly Compensated Eligible Employees after the close of the Plan Year in
which such Excess Aggregate Contributions arose and within 12 months after the
close of the following Plan Year.  If feasible, the Committee shall in its sole
discretion determine and distribute 





                                     -35-

<PAGE>   43

the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions within two and one-half (2 1/2)
months after the end of the Plan Year.  In the event of the complete termination
of the Plan during such Plan Year, the distributions described in the preceding
sentence shall be made after termination of the Plan and within the 12 months
following such termination.

         The amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions for a Highly Compensated
Eligible Employee for a Plan Year is to be determined by the following
contribution leveling method, under which the actual contribution ratio of the
Highly Compensated Eligible Employee with the highest actual contribution ratio
is reduced to the extent required to satisfy the Actual Contribution Percentage
Test set forth above or to cause such Highly Compensated Eligible Employee's
actual contribution ratio to equal the ratio of the Highly Compensated Eligible
Employee with the next highest actual contribution ratio.  This process must be
repeated until the Actual Contribution Percentage Test is satisfied for such
Plan Year.

         In determining the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions under the
leveling method set forth above, actual contribution ratios must be rounded to
the nearest one-hundredth percent of the Eligible Employee's Considered
Compensation.  In no case shall the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions
with respect to any Highly Compensated Eligible Employee exceed the amount of
the After-Tax Employee Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions made
by or on behalf of such Highly Compensated Eligible Employee for such Plan
Year.  Excess Aggregate Contributions for a Plan Year shall be distributed or
forfeited in accordance with the provisions set 





                                     -36-

<PAGE>   44

forth above and shall not remain unallocated or allocated to a suspense account
for allocation to one or more Employees in any future year.  The determination
of the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions with respect to a Plan Year
shall be made after the determination and correction of Excess Deferrals under
Article III, Section 3.7, and the determination and correction of Excess
Contributions under Article III, Section 3.5, respectively, have been made.  An
Employer Matching Contribution shall be taken into account in the Actual
Contribution Percentage Test for a Plan Year only if it has been allocated (or
allocable) to the Participant's Account for such Plan Year and has been actually
paid to the Trust no later than 12 months after the close of such Plan Year.

         In the case of a Highly Compensated Eligible Employee whose Actual
Contribution Percentage is determined under the family aggregation rules of
Code Section 414(q), the determination of the amount of Excess Aggregate
Contributions shall be made as follows:

                 (1)      If the Highly Compensated Eligible Employee's Actual
         Contribution Percentage is determined by combining the contributions
         and compensation of all Family Participants, then the Actual
         Contribution Percentage is reduced in accordance with the leveling
         method described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(m)-1(e)(2) and the
         Excess Aggregate Contributions for the family unit are allocated among
         the Family Participants in proportion to the contributions of each
         Family Participant that have been combined to determine the Actual
         Contribution Percentage.

                 (2)      If the Highly Compensated Eligible Employee's Actual
         Contribution Percentage is determined by combining the contributions
         of only those Family Participants who are Highly Compensated Eligible
         Employees without regard to family aggregation, then the Actual
         Contribution Percentage is reduced in accordance with the leveling
         method described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(m)-1(e)(2) but not
         below the Actual Contribution Percentage of Family Participants who
         are Non-Highly Compensated Eligible Employees without regard to family
         aggregation.  Excess Aggregate Contributions are determined by taking
         into 





                                     -37-

<PAGE>   45

         account the contributions of the eligible Family Participants who
         are Highly Compensated Eligible Employees without regard to family
         aggregation and are allocated among such Family Participants in
         proportion to each such Family Participant's employee contributions and
         Employer Matching Contributions.  If further reduction of the Actual
         Contribution Percentage is required, Excess Aggregate Contributions
         resulting from this reduction are determined by taking into account the
         contributions of all eligible Family Participants and are allocated
         among such Family Participants in proportion to the employee
         contributions and Employer Matching Contributions of each Family
         Participant.

Paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall be administered in accordance with Treas.
Reg. Section 1.401(m)-1(e)(2)(iii).

         Restriction on Multiple Use of Alternative Limit.  In addition to the
limits prescribed by this Section 3.6 and Section 3.5 of this Article III, in
the event the limits in those sections have been both satisfied under the 1.25
or (a) portion limit or otherwise in a manner that would violate Section
401(m)(9)(A) of the Code, the provisions of Section 1.401(m)-2 of the Treasury
Regulations shall be applied and complied with in order to satisfy this
requirement.  This may result in corrective distributions to certain Highly
Compensated Eligible Employees.  Any corrections or other adjustments made to
satisfy this requirement shall be determined by the Committee with the maximum
discretion permitted under the Treasury Regulations.

         3.7     Excess Deferral Contributions.  The amount by which an
Eligible Employee's Deferral Contribution (including for this purpose any other
total personal deferral contribution within the meaning of Section 3.1 above)
in any Plan Year exceeds the limitation in effect under Section 402(g)(1) of
the Code and referred to in Section 3.1 above for such Plan Year shall be known





                                     -38-

<PAGE>   46

as the Eligible Employee's Excess Deferral for such Plan Year.  An Eligible
Employee's Excess Deferral for any Plan Year shall not be considered as
reducing such Eligible Employee's compensation under Article III, Section 3.1
to the extent of such Excess Deferral.

         An Eligible Employee's Excess Deferral is not required to be refunded
to such Eligible Employee.   However, notwithstanding any other provision of
law or of this Plan limiting distributions, the Committee in its sole
discretion may refund any Eligible Employee's Excess Deferral (plus any
allocable income) to such Eligible Employee in accordance with the provisions
set forth below.  If a Participant has made an Excess Deferral for his taxable
year, the Participant must notify the Committee in writing no later than the
March 15th following the end of such taxable year, on the form prescribed by
the Committee for this purpose, of the amount the Participant requests to be
distributed.  The distribution to the Participant shall be made after such
taxable year but no later than April 15th following the close of such taxable
year.  Alternatively, the Committee may also provide for a distribution of the 
Excess Deferral during such taxable year, provided the following conditions are
satisfied:

                 (a)      The Participant designates the distribution as an
         Excess Deferral;

                 (b)      The distribution of the Excess Deferral is made after
         the date in which the Plan received the Excess Deferral; and

                 (c)      The Committee designates the distribution as a
         distribution of an Excess Deferral.

The amount of Excess Deferral to be distributed to a Participant for the
Participant's taxable year shall be reduced by any Excess 





                                     -39-

<PAGE>   47

Contribution previously distributed or recharacterized as an After-Tax Employee
Contribution for the Plan Year beginning with or within such taxable year
(except that such recharacterized contribution shall continue to be treated as a
Deferral Contribution for purposes of the distribution provisions in Article VII
of the Plan).

         3.8     Time of Payment.  The Employer Matching Contribution and
Employer Contribution of each Signatory Company for each Plan Year shall be
paid to the Trust in one or more installments as the Signatory Company (subject
to the consent of the Company) may from time to time determine; provided,
however, that all such installments shall be paid no later than the time
prescribed by law for filing such Signatory Company's federal income tax return
for such taxable year (including extensions thereof) and, if earlier with
respect to the Employer Matching Contribution, no later than 12 months after
the close of the Plan Year.  The Deferral Contributions and After-Tax Employee 
Contributions shall be paid to the Trust no later than the earlier of

                 (a)      the time set forth in the preceding sentence except
         that Deferral Contribution shall substitute for Employer Matching
         Contribution the second time it appears, or

                 (b)      in accordance with 29 CFR Section 2510.3-102, the
         earliest date on which such contributions can reasonably be segregated
         from the Signatory Company's general assets, but not to exceed 90 days
         from the date on which 





                                     -40-

<PAGE>   48

         such amounts would otherwise have been payable to the Participant.

         3.9     Committee to Prescribe Rules Governing Deferral Contributions
and After-Tax Employee Contributions.  Deferral Contributions and After-Tax
Employee Contributions may be made only in accordance with such uniform rules
and regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the Committee.  Such
uniform rules and regulations of the Committee may, among other things and
subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan, restrict Deferral
Contributions and After-Tax Employee Contributions to those made through
authorized payroll deductions and require payroll deductions to be authorized
on a specified periodic basis.

         3.10    Prohibition Against Reversion.  In no event, except as
expressly provided in Article XX and Article V, Section 5.6 hereof (or as
otherwise permitted by law including Section 403(c)(2)(A)(i) of the Act 
pertaining to contributions made by reason of a mistake in fact), shall the
principal or income of the Trust herein created be paid to or revert to the
Signatory Company, or be used for any purpose other than for the exclusive
benefit of the Participants or their Beneficiaries.

         3.11    No Limitation Based on Net Profits.  No Deferral Contribution,
Employer Matching Contribution or Employer Contribution to be made under the
Plan by any Signatory Company shall fail to be made, or be reduced, suspended,
postponed or in any way affected, by reason of such Signatory Company's (or any
other Signatory Company or Affiliated Company) having current and/or
accumulated Net Profits in an amount less than such Deferral 





                                     -41-

<PAGE>   49

Contribution, Employer Matching Contribution or Employer Contribution to be made
to the Plan.

         3.12    Other Limits.    In no event shall the sum of the Deferral
Contributions (including recharacterized Excess Contributions), and the
Signatory Company's Employer Matching Contribution, and the Signatory Company's
Employer Contribution exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the
total Considered Compensation (as modified for purposes of Section 404(a)(3)(A)
of the Code) otherwise paid or accrued during such Plan Year of such Signatory
Company plus the maximum amount deductible under the "carry-over" provisions of
the Code relating to Employer Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions
in previous years of less than the maximum amount permissible.  In addition, in
no event shall the aggregate of such Deferral Contribution, Employer Matching
Contribution, Employer Contribution and the Signatory Company's contributions to
all other qualified pension, profit sharing or stock bonus plans for such Plan
Year exceed the amount deductible from the Signatory Company's income for such
Plan Year under Section 404(a) of the Code.  In the event the aggregate of the
Signatory Company's contributions under all plans would exceed such maximum
deductible amount, the Employer Matching Contribution and Employer Contribution
to the Plans shall to the extent permissible by law be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the Signatory Company's aggregate contribution under all
such plans to the maximum amount deductible under said section of the Code.  All
such contributions under the Plan are hereby expressly made conditional 





                                     -42-

on their allowability as a deduction for federal corporate income tax purposes.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

                             Allocation to Accounts

         4.1     Certification by the Signatory Company.  As soon as
practicable after the end of the first Plan Year and the end of each succeeding
Plan Year thereafter, the Signatory Company shall certify to the Committee the
amount of its Employer Matching Contribution and Employer Contribution (if any)
for the Plan Year then ended and the names of the Participants entitled to
share therein, the amount of Considered Compensation paid to each Participant
for such Plan Year and the amount of Considered Compensation paid to all
Participants for such Plan Year and any other personnel information requested
by the Committee as necessary for purposes of this Plan.  Such certification
shall be conclusive evidence of such facts.

         4.2     Separate Account Maintained for Each Participant.  The
Committee shall create and maintain adequate records to disclose the interest
in the Trust Fund of each Participant and Beneficiary.  Such records shall be
in the form of individual Accounts, and credits and charges shall be made to
such Accounts in the manner herein described.  The maintenance of individual
Accounts is only for accounting purposes and a segregation of the assets of the
Trust Fund to each Account shall not be required.

         4.3     Transfer and Allocation of After-Tax Employee Contributions
and Deferral Contributions to Participants' Accounts.  Subject to the
provisions of Article III, Section 3.8 hereof, as 





                                     -43-

<PAGE>   51

soon as administratively  feasible following the end of each payroll period
under procedures adopted by the Committee, the Signatory Company shall transfer
the After-Tax Employee Contributions and Deferral Contributions to the Trustee
and shall certify to the Committee the names of the Eligible Employees, the
names of the Participants, the After-Tax Employee Contribution and Deferral
Contribution amount for each Participant.  The Committee shall allocate the
Deferral Contribution and After-Tax Employee Contributions made on behalf of a
Participant directly to such Participant's Account.

         4.4     Allocation of Employer Matching Contributions to Participants'
Accounts.  As soon as administratively feasible following the end of each
payroll period under procedures adopted by the Committee, the Committee shall
determine the Deferral Contribution amount for each Participant of the Plan.
The Committee shall then, under procedures adopted by it, allocate an amount
from the Signatory Company's Employer Matching Contribution (if any) to the
Participant's Account which is equal to the matching percentage, as determined
by the Board of Directors under Article III, Section 3.2 hereof, of the
Participant's Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year.

         4.5     Allocation of Employer Contribution to Participants' Accounts.

                 (a)      The Committee shall allocate the Signatory Company's
         Employer Contribution (if any) for each Plan year among the
         Participants employed by the Signatory Company (who are eligible to
         receive such an allocation 





                                     -44-

<PAGE>   52

         for such Plan year) in accordance with the following formula 
         (beginning with the Plan Year ending June 30, 1994):

                               (i)         Each Participant shall be allocated
                 one (1) unit for each Year of Service completed by the
                 Participant since becoming an Eligible Employee under Article
                 I, Section 1.19 and Article II, Section 2.1, provided that the
                 maximum Years of Service counted for any Highly Compensated
                 Eligible Employee is fifteen (15).

                              (ii)         Each Participant shall be allocated
                 one (1) unit for each one dollar ($1.00) of that Participant's
                 Considered Compensation for the Plan Year for which the
                 allocation is being made.  Any cents beyond the Participant's
                 last whole dollar shall be rounded off to the nearest whole
                 dollar for this purpose.

                             (iii)         The Employer Contribution shall be
                 allocated to the Accounts of Participants in the proportion to
                 which the number of units allocated to each Participant bears
                 to the total number of units allocated to all Participants for
                 the Plan Year.

A Participant who holds the title of President or Vice President of the Company
on the last day of the Plan Year, shall not be eligible to receive an
allocation of any Employer Contribution or Forfeiture for such Plan Year.  Any
Participant who fails to both remain in employment until the last day of the
Plan Year and complete a Year of Service during such Plan Year shall not be
eligible to participate in the Plan for such Plan Year for purposes of sharing
in the allocation in Employer Contributions and Forfeitures.

                 (b)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if
         this Plan would otherwise fail to meet the requirements of Sections
         401(a)(26), 410(b)(1), or 410(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and the
         regulations thereunder because Employer Contributions have not been





                                     -45-

<PAGE>   53

         allocated to a sufficient number or percentage of Participants for a
         Plan Year, then the following rules shall apply:

                          (i)     The group of Participants eligible to share
                 in the Employer Contributions and Forfeitures for the Plan
                 Year shall be expanded to include the minimum number of
                 Participants who would not otherwise be eligible as are
                 necessary to satisfy the applicable test specified above.  The
                 specific participants who shall become eligible under the
                 terms of this paragraph shall be those who are employed on the
                 last day of the Plan Year and, when compared to similarly
                 situated Participants, have completed the greatest number of
                 Hours of Service in the Plan Year.

                     (ii)         If after application of paragraph (i) above,
                 the applicable test is still not satisfied, then the group of
                 Participants eligible to share in the Employer Contributions
                 and Forfeitures for the Plan Year shall be further expanded to
                 include the minimum number of Participants who are not
                 actively employed on the last day of the Plan Year as are
                 necessary to satisfy the applicable test.  The specific
                 Participants who shall become eligible to share shall be those
                 Participants, when compared to similarly situated
                 Participants, who have completed the greatest number of Hours
                 of Service in the Plan Year before terminating employment.

Nothing in the preceding provisions of this Section 4.5(b) shall permit the
reduction of a Participant's accrued benefit, expressed as his Account balance.
Therefore any amounts that have previously been allocated to Participants may
not be reallocated to satisfy these requirements.  In such event, the Employer
shall make an additional contribution equal to the amount such affected
Participants would have received had they been included in the allocations,
even if it exceeds the amount which would be deductible by the Company under
Section 404 of the Code.  Any adjustment to the allocations pursuant to this
paragraph shall be 





                                     -46-

<PAGE>   54

considered a retroactive amendment adopted by the last day of the Plan Year.

         4.6     Quarterly Allocation of Trust Fund Income.  As of the end of
each quarter (i.e., calendar quarter), the Committee shall determine the amount
of income earned by each class of investment since the preceding quarter.  The
Committee shall allocate such income among the Participants in the proportion
that the "average amount" in each Participant's Account invested in each class
of investment at the end of each such quarter since the preceding quarter bears
to the aggregate of such average amounts of all Participants' Accounts invested
in such class of investments at the end of such quarter period since the
preceding quarter.  For purposes of this Section 4.6 and Section 4.7 the term
"average amount" in a Participant's Account for a quarter shall be equal to
the sum of (a) the balance in the Participant's Account on the first day of
such quarter plus (b) one-half ( 1/2) of all contributions (made under Sections
3.1-3.4) credited or allocated to such Account during such quarter, less (c)
any distributions made to such Participant under Article IX of the Plan during
such quarter.  If a Participant received the total balance in his Account
during a quarter, there shall be no income allocation for such quarter for such
Participant.

         Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 4.6, the
income earned on or properly attributable to the investments of the Employer
Contributions made to the Trust for a Plan Year prior to the allocation of such
contributions as of the last day of such Plan Year, may for that Plan Year, in
the sole discretion of the 





                                     -47-

<PAGE>   55

Committee, be separately allocated by including such income (or loss) as part of
the Employer Contributions for purposes of making the allocation in Section 4.5
of this Article IV.  In exercising its discretion the Committee shall take into
account whether such an allocation is proper under Section 401(a) of the Code
including the regulations under Section 401(a)(4).

         4.7     Quarterly Valuation of Trust Fund.  As of the end of each
quarter, the Trustee shall revalue the Trust Fund at its then fair market
value.  The Committee shall then allocate any appreciation or depreciation in
the Trust Fund among the Participants' Accounts in the proportion that the
average amount in each Participant's Account invested in such class of
investments bears to the aggregate of such average amounts of all Participants'
Accounts at the end of such quarter after the allocation of income under
Section 4.6.  Beginning with the second quarterly period, the Trustee shall
allocate any appreciation in the Trust Fund among the Participants in the
proportion that the "average amount" for each Participant's Account quarter
bears to the aggregate of such average amounts of all Participants' Accounts
for such quarter.  If a Participant receives the total balance in his Account
during a quarter, there shall be no valuation adjustment for such quarter.

         The Committee shall have the authority to change the number of times
the Trust Fund is revalued during the Plan Year.

         4.8     Special Allocation Upon Termination, Partial Termination, or
Complete Discontinuance of Employer Matching Contributions and Employer
Contributions.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this instrument to the
contrary, if:





                                     -48-

<PAGE>   56

                 (a)      the Plan is terminated pursuant to Article XVI, 
         Section 16.3 hereof; or

                 (b)      the Plan is terminated with respect to a sufficiently
         large enough group of Participants to constitute a partial termination
         of the Plan; or

                 (c)      this is a complete discontinuance of Employer
         Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions;

all previously unallocated funds shall be allocated to the Accounts of the
Participants at the time of such termination, partial termination or complete
discontinuance of Employer Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions
under the Plan using the allocation methods prescribed by Sections 4.3 through
4.6 hereof as appropriate depending on the nature and source of such unallocated
funds.

         4.9     Entry of Adjustments to Each Participant's Account.  The
Committee shall credit to each Participant's Account such Participant's portion
of the adjustments and allocations required by Section 4.3 through Section 4.7
of this Plan, so that all such adjustments and allocations become effective and
shall be entered into each Participant's Account as of the end of the Plan Year
to which they are attributable unless required more frequently by the Committee
pursuant to Sections 4.3 through 4.7.

         4.10    Rights in Trust Assets.  No allocations, adjustments, credits
or transfers under this Plan shall ever vest in any Participant any right,
title or interest in the Trust Fund except at the times and upon the terms or
conditions set forth in this Plan.  Such Trust Fund shall, as to all Accounts
of Participants, be a commingled fund, and all securities purchased or
otherwise acquired by the Trustee under the Plan shall be issued in the name 





                                     -49-

<PAGE>   57

of the Trustee for the Plan, or in such other name or names as the Trustee shall
designate.

         4.11    Application of Forfeitures.  The Committee shall, after the
end of each Plan Year, determine the Participants from the Signatory Company
who have forfeited all or part of their respective interests in their Accounts
pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, Sections 7.5(a) and 7.6 hereof, 
during such Plan Year.  The total amount of all Forfeitures shall then be
applied in accordance with Article VII, Section 7.6.

                                   ARTICLE V.

                        Limitations on Annual Additions

         5.1     Limitation Under this Plan.  Notwithstanding any provisions
herein to the contrary, the Annual Addition to the Accounts of any Participant
under all defined contribution plans of his Employer (as that term is defined
in Section 5.4 hereof) for any Plan Year cannot exceed the lesser of:

                 (a)      Thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or such greater
         amount as may be determined pursuant to Section 415(c)(1)(A) of the
         Code, as adjusted under Section 415(d) of the Code; or

                 (b)      Twenty-five percent (25%) of the Participant's
         compensation from his Employer for such Plan Year, as determined under
         Section 415(c)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

         5.2     Limitation in Event of Participant's Participation in Defined
Benefit Plan and Defined Contribution Plan.  In any case in which an Employee
is a participant in both a defined benefit plan and this Plan, the sum of the
defined benefit plan fraction and the defined contribution plan fraction for
any year may not exceed 1.0 except as may be permitted by Section 2004(a)(3) or
otherwise under 





                                     -50-

<PAGE>   58

the Act.  The defined benefit plan fraction for any year is a fraction (a) the
numerator of which is the projected annual benefit of the Participant under the
plan (determined as of the close of the Plan Year); and (b) the denominator of
which is the lesser of:  (i) the product of 1.25, multiplied by the dollar
limitation in effect for such Plan Year under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code,
or (ii) the product of 1.4, multiplied by the amount which may be taken into
account under Section 415(b)(1)(B) of the Code with respect to such Participant
for such Plan Year.  The defined contribution plan fraction for any year is a
fraction (a) the numerator of which is the sum of the Annual Additions to the
Participant's Account as of the close of the Plan Year; and (b) the denominator
of which is the sum of the lesser of the following amounts determined for such
Plan Year and for each prior Year of Service:  (i) the product of 1.25,
multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect for such Plan Year as may be
determined pursuant to Section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code, or (ii) the product of
1.4, multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Section
415(c)(1)(B) of the Code for such Plan Year.  The Committee shall reduce the
numerator of the defined contribution plan fraction in order that their sum
shall not exceed 1.0 for any Plan Year in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof.

         However, 1.0 shall be substituted for 1.25 for any Top Heavy Plan Year
unless an extra minimum Employer Matching Contribution equal to one percent
(1%) of the Considered Compensation of all Participants who are Non-Key
Employees is allocated among such Participants pursuant to Article IV, Section
4.4.  Notwithstanding





                                      -51-

<PAGE>   59
the foregoing, 1.0 shall be substituted for 1.25 for any Plan Year in which the
Plan is a Super Top Heavy Plan.

         5.3     Disposition of Excessive Annual Additions.  If as a result of
a reasonable error in estimating a Participant's Considered Compensation, the
Annual Additions under the terms of the Plan for a particular Participant would
cause the limitations of Section 415 of the Code which are applicable to that
Participant for that Plan Year to be exceeded, the excess amounts shall not be
deemed Annual Additions to such Participant's Account in that Plan Year, but
shall be treated in one of the following four alternatives as selected by the
Committee in each case:

                 (a)      The excess amounts attributable to Employer Matching
         Contributions or Employer Contributions in the Participant's Account
         must be allocated and reallocated to the Accounts of the other
         Participants in the Plan, pursuant to the provisions of Article IV,
         Section 4.4.  However, if the allocation or reallocation of the excess
         amounts further causes the limitations of Section 415 of the Code to
         be exceeded with respect to each Plan Participant for that Plan Year,
         then these amounts must be held unallocated in a suspense account.  If
         a suspense account is in existence at any time during a particular
         Plan Year (other than the Plan Year described in the preceding
         sentence), all amounts in the suspense account must first be allocated
         and reallocated to Participants' Accounts (subject to the limitations
         of Section 415 of the Code) before any Employer Matching Contributions
         or Employer Contributions may be made to the Plan for that Plan Year.

                 (b)      The excess amounts in the Participant's Account must
         be used to reduce Employer Contributions or Employer Matching
         Contributions for the next limitation year (and succeeding limitation
         years, as necessary) for that Participant if that Participant is
         covered by the Plan of the Employer as of the end of the limitation
         year.  However, if that Participant is not covered by the Plan
         of the Employer as of the end of the limitation year, then the excess
         amounts must be held unallocated in a suspense account for the
         limitation year and allocated and reallocated in the next limitation
         year to all of the remaining Participants in the Plan in accordance
         with the rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.3. 





                                     -52-

<PAGE>   60

         Furthermore, the excess amounts must be used to reduce Employer
         Contributions or Employer Matching Contributions for the next
         limitation year (and succeeding limitation years, as necessary) for all
         of the remaining Participants in the Plan.  For purposes of this
         paragraph (b), excess amounts may not be distributed to Participants or
         former Participants.

                 (c)      The excess amounts in the Participant's Account must
         be held unallocated in a suspense account for the limitation year and
         allocated and reallocated in the next limitation year and allocated
         and reallocated in the next limitation year to all of the Participants
         in the Plan in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (a) of
         this Section 5.3.  The excess amounts must be used to reduce Employer
         Contributions or Employer Matching Contributions for the next
         limitation year (and succeeding limitation years, as necessary) for
         all of the Participants in the Plan.  For purposes of this
         subdivision, excess amounts may not be distributed to Participants or
         former Participants.

                 (d)      Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this
         Section 5.3, Deferral Contributions and After- Tax Employee
         Contributions may be distributed in accordance with Treas. Reg.
         1.415-6(b)(6)(iv).

         5.4     Combining of Plans.  For purposes of applying the limitations
contained in this article, all defined contribution plans, terminated or not,
of an Employer shall be treated as one defined contribution plan and all
defined benefit plans, terminated or not, of an Employer shall be treated as
one defined benefit plan.  For purposes of this article, Employer shall mean
all trades or businesses, whether or not incorporated, which are either under
common control as determined under Sections 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code or are
an affiliated service group as determined under Section 414(m) of the Code.  For
the purpose of applying the limitations set forth above, as imposed by Section
415 of the Code, a Participant's compensation or annual benefit payable by the
Signatory Company or any Affiliated Company of the Signatory Company shall be
treated as being from a single employer.  For 





                                     -53-

<PAGE>   61

purposes of the limitations of this section and of applying Sections 414(b) and
414(c) of the Code as they relate to Sections 415 and 1563(a)(1) of the Code,
the phrase "more than fifty percent (50%)" shall be substituted for the phrase
"at least eighty percent (80%)".

         5.5     Transition Fraction.  At the election of the Committee, in
applying the provisions of Section 5.3 with respect to the defined contribution
fraction for any Plan Year ending after December 31, 1982, the amount taken
into account for the denominator for each Participant for all Plan Years ending
before January 1, 1983 shall be an amount equal to the product of (a) the
amount of the denominator determined under Section 5.3 (as in effect for the
Plan Year ending in 1982) for Plan Years ending in 1982, multiplied by (b) the
"transition fraction".

         For purposes of the preceding paragraph, the term "transition
fraction" shall mean a fraction (a) the numerator of which is the lesser of (1)
$51,875 or (2) 1.4 multiplied by twenty-five percent (25%) of the Participant's
compensation for the Plan Year ending in 1981, and (b) the denominator of which
is the lesser of (1) $41,500 or (2) twenty-five percent (25%) of the
Participant's compensation for the Plan Year ending in 1981.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Plan Year in which the Plan is
a Top Heavy Plan, $41,500 shall be substituted for $51,875 in determining the
transition fraction."

         5.6     Right of Reversion.  Notwithstanding Article III, Section
3.10, in the event of termination of the Plan as provided in 





                                     -54-

<PAGE>   62

Article XVI, Section 16.3 any amounts held in the suspense account shall revert
to the Signatory Company.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                   Retirement and Designation of Beneficiary

         6.1     Normal Retirement Date.  "Normal Retirement Age" means the
date on which an Employee attains age sixty-five (65).  The date on which the
Employee retires from employment following his Normal Retirement Age, shall be
his Normal Retirement Date.

         6.2     Designation of Beneficiary.  Each Participant and each Retired
Participant shall have the right at any time, to designate and to rescind or
change any prior designation of a primary and contingent Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries to receive benefits in the event of his death, except as
hereinafter provided.  The designation by a Participant who was married at the
time of his death of a Beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse shall
only be valid and recognized with such Participant's spouse's written consent. 
Such consent must designate a specific beneficiary, must acknowledge the effect
of the Participant's designation and must be witnessed either by a member of the
Committee or by a Notary Public.  Otherwise the death benefits of the
Participant shall be paid to the Participant's spouse, except as hereinafter
provided.  A Participant's designation of a Beneficiary other than such
Participant's spouse, which is consented to by such Participant's spouse as
provided above, may not be changed without subsequent spousal consent (unless
the spouse's consent to the original Beneficiary designation expressly permits
designations by the Participant without further spousal 





                                     -55-

<PAGE>   63

consent).  Any designation, change or rescission of designation shall be made in
writing by filling out and furnishing to the Committee the appropriate form
prescribed by it.  A contingent Beneficiary or Beneficiaries shall be entitled
to receive any unpaid death benefits only if no primary Beneficiary is alive or
legally entitled to receive it on the date of payment of the benefit.  Any
estate, assignee or appointee of either a primary or a contingent Beneficiary
shall have no interest in or right to receive any death benefit payment not
actually made before the death of such Beneficiary.  The last such designation
received by the Committee shall be controlling over any testamentary or other
disposition; provided, however, that no designation, rescission or change
thereof shall be effective unless received by the Committee.  Upon the divorce
of a Participant or a Retired Participant, any designation of his divorced
spouse as a primary Beneficiary or as a contingent Beneficiary hereunder shall
automatically terminate and become ineffective, and such divorced spouse shall
have no interest in or right to receive any death benefit hereunder unless such
Participant shall file with the Committee, after the date of such divorce
decree, a new designation of Beneficiary naming his divorced spouse as a
Beneficiary hereunder.  If there is no designated Beneficiary (as defined above)
alive at the time of any payment of the death benefit, then the death benefit or
balance thereof shall be paid to the surviving spouse of the deceased
Participant or, if there is no surviving spouse, to the estate of the deceased
Participant.  If the Committee shall be in doubt as to the right of any
Beneficiary designated by a deceased Participant 





                                     -56-

<PAGE>   64

to receive any unpaid death benefit, the Committee may direct the Trustee to pay
the amount in question to the estate of such Participant, in which event the
Trustee, the Signatory Company, the Committee and any other person in any manner
connected with the Plan shall have no further liability in respect to the amount
so paid.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                       Vesting of Participants' Interests

         7.1     Vesting.  Each Participant shall immediately and at all times
have a one hundred percent (100%) vested interest in the amount credited to his
Account attributable to Deferral Contributions and After-Tax Employee
Contributions.  As to the amount credited to a Participant's Account
attributable to Employer Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions, the
Participant's interest shall vest as set forth in Sections 7.2 - 7.5 below.

         7.2     Death.  On the death of a Participant (or a terminated
Participant prior to the complete distribution of such terminated Participant's
Account) his death benefit shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the amount
credited to his Account at the end of the Plan quarter in which he dies.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, in the case of a
Participant who is married at the time of his death, the death benefit under
this Section shall be payable in full to such Participant's spouse, or in the
event there is no surviving spouse or such surviving spouse has consented in
the manner provided in Article VI, Section 6.2, to a designated Beneficiary.





                                     -57-

<PAGE>   65

         7.3     Retirement.  Upon attaining his Normal Retirement Age as a
Participant prior to termination of employment with the Employer, such
Participant shall have a nonforfeitable right to his Account balance.

         7.4     Disability.  In the event the Committee determines that a
Participant qualifies for a Total Permanent Disability, his disability benefit
shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the amount credited to his Account at
the end of the Plan quarter following such determination.

         If a Participant who had previously been determined to have a Total
Permanent Disability returns to the employment of the Signatory Company prior
to receiving the entire balance in his Account, a separate ledger account shall
be created for such Participant and the remaining portion of his Account shall
be transferred to such new Account, which shall share in income allocations and
valuation adjustments pursuant to Article IV, Sections 4.6 and 4.7 until the
amount is distributed in full upon his subsequent death, retirement,
determination of Total Permanent Disability or severance of employment.  A new
Account shall be established for the returning Participant as if he were a new
Participant, and said Account shall vest pursuant to Section 7.5 starting at
the point on the vesting schedule the Participant had achieved prior to the
determination of his Total Permanent Disability.

         7.5     Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Vesting Schedule.  A Participant whose employment is
         terminated for any reason other than death, retirement at or after
         Normal Retirement Age or Total Permanent Disability, shall be entitled
         to a severance 





                                     -58-

<PAGE>   66

         benefit of the vested interest in his Account attributable to
         After-Tax Employee Contributions, Deferral Contributions, Employer
         Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions in such Participant's
         Account following termination of employment.  A Participant's "vested
         interest" shall be determined using the following schedule for the
         percentage of the balance of such Participant's Account attributable to
         Employer Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions for the
         number of Years of Service up through the Entry Date prior to the date
         of the distribution of the benefit.  As provided in Section 7.1, a
         Participant's vested interest in his Account attributable to After-Tax
         Employee Contributions and Deferral Contributions shall at all times be
         one hundred percent (100%).

                          (i)     Each Participant's interest in the amount
                 credited to his Account attributable to Employer Matching
                 Contributions and Employer Contributions shall vest as
                 provided in the schedule set forth below and, once vested,
                 shall not be forfeitable for any reason (except as otherwise
                 permitted by law and provided in this Plan):

                 the following shall apply:  A Participant who has at least
                 three (3) Years of Service as of the effective date of the
                 change to the vesting schedule, shall have the right during
                 the election period to elect to have the nonforfeitable
                 percentage of his benefit derived from Employer Matching 
                 Contributions and Employer Contributions computed under this 
                 Section 7.5(a) without regard to such amendment.

                 the preceding sentence, no election need be provided for
                 any Participant whose nonforfeitable percentage under the Plan,
                 as amended, at any time cannot be less than such percentage
                 determined without regard to such amendment.  The election
                 period shall begin on the date the amendment is adopted and
                 shall end no earlier than the latest of (a) sixty (60) days

                 after the date the amendment becomes effective, or (c) sixty
                 (60) days after the Participant is issued written notice of the
                 Plan amendment by the Employer, Signatory Company or Committee.
                 A Participant shall be considered to have completed three (3)
                 Years of Service for purposes of this paragraph if such
                 Participant has completed three (3) Years of Service, whether
                 or not consecutive, without regard to the exceptions of Code
                 Section 411(a)(4) prior to the expiration of the election
                 period.

                 The amount credited to such Participant's Account which is not
         vested when he terminates employment shall be disposed of as provided
         in Section 7.6 of this Article VII.

                 (b)      Years of Service Computation.  For purposes of
         determining the Participant's vested interest in the assets in his
         Account, all Years of Service with the Signatory Company, or any
         Affiliated Company, or any predecessor employer as of the date of
         severance shall be taken into account except as provided below with
         respect to Participants who terminate employment with a Signatory
         Company and then later return to such employment:

                          (i)     A Participant who had any vested interest
                 (greater than zero) in the portion of his Account attributable
                 to Employer Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions
                 at the time of his termination of employment, shall receive
                 credit for Years of Service prior to his Break in Service upon
                 completing a Year of Service after his return to the employ of
                 a Signatory Company;

                          (ii)    A Participant who had no vested interest
                 (i.e., had been zero percent vested) in the portion of his
                 Account attributable to Employer Contributions and Employer
                 Matching Contributions at the time of his termination of
                 employment shall not receive credit for Years of Service prior
                 to his Break in Service if the number of consecutive one-year
                 Breaks-in-Service equals or exceeds the greater of five (5) or
                 the aggregate number of Years of Service completed prior to
                 the Break-in-Service; and





                                     -60-

<PAGE>   68

                          (iii) all Years of Service after five (5) consecutive
                 years of Breaks-in-Service shall be disregarded for purposes
                 of determining the Participant's vested interest in his
                 Account attributable to Employer Contributions and Employer
                 Matching Contributions that accrued prior to such
                 Break-in-Service.

         7.6     Disposition of Unvested Amounts.  After termination of
employment, the amount in the Participant's Account shall be maintained until
forfeited as provided in the next two sentences.  The unvested portion of the
Account balance attributable to Employer Contributions and Employer Matching
Contributions shall be forfeited upon the earlier of (a) the last day of the
Plan Year in which the Participant incurs five (5) consecutive one-year of
Breaks-in-Service, or (b) the day on which the Participant receives a
distribution of his vested Account balance.  Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence a Participant who terminates employment with a zero vested Account
balance shall be deemed to have received a zero distribution of such Account
balance on the last day of the Plan Year in which termination of employment 
occurred and on such last day the forfeiture of such Account balance will occur.

         As of the last day of the Plan Year in which a forfeiture occurs the
amount forfeited shall be applied as follows:  The unvested amount attributable
to Employer Matching Contributions shall first be available, in the discretion
of the Committee, to the payment of administration expenses of the Plan or
Trust and then be applied toward and to otherwise reduce the Employer Matching
Contributions to be made to the Plan.  The unvested amount attributable to
Employer Contributions shall be allocated in the 





                                     -61-

<PAGE>   69

same manner as Employer Contributions (in accordance with Article IV, Section
4.5) for such Plan Year.

         7.7     Circumstances Rendering Vesting Schedule Inapplicable.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this instrument to the contrary, if:

                 (a)      the Plan is terminated pursuant to Article XVI, 
         Section 16.3 hereof; or

                 (b)      the Plan is terminated with respect to a large enough
         group of Participants to constitute in a "partial termination" of the
         Plan; or

                 (c)      there occurs a complete discontinuance of Employer
         Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions under the Plan,

the vesting schedule contained in Section 7.5(a) hereof shall be inapplicable
and each remaining Participant "affected" by such termination, partial
termination or complete discontinuance of Employer Matching Contributions and
Employer Contributions shall thereupon have a full one hundred percent (100%)
vested interest in the amount standing to his credit in his Account at the time
of the triggering event and in any amounts thereafter credited or allocated to
his Account; provided, however, that if the Signatory Company shall thereafter
resume making Employer Matching Contributions or Employer Contributions
hereunder, all amounts credited or allocated to a Participant's Account with
respect to the Plan Year for which such Employer Contributions are resumed and
the Plan Years for which they are continued, shall vest only in accordance with
the vesting schedule contained in Section 7.5(a) hereof.  For purposes of this
section, a complete discontinuance of Employer Matching Contributions and
Employer Contributions under the Plan is contrasted with a suspension of
Employer Matching 





                                     -62-

<PAGE>   70

Contributions and Employer Contributions under the Plan which is merely a
temporary cessation of Employer Matching Contributions and Employer
Contributions by the Signatory Company.  During any such period of termination,
partial termination or complete discontinuance of Employer Matching
Contributions and Employer Contributions under the Plan, all other provisions of
this Plan shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect.  The Signatory
Company shall notify the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service in
the event it has completely discontinued to make Employer Matching Contributions
and Employer Contributions to the Plan or in the event of termination or
partial termination of the Plan.

    7.8     Hardship Distribution.

              (a)   In the event that a Participant is not otherwise entitled 
to the payment of benefits under this Plan and such Participant demonstrates an
immediate and heavy financial need for such benefits, the Committee may
authorize the commencement of benefit payments prior to the time set forth in
Article IX, Section 9.1, but only in the amount necessary to satisfy such
financial need.  The Committee shall exercise this authority in a uniform,
nondiscriminatory manner.  The determination of the existence of an immediate
and heavy financial need and of the amount necessary to meet the need shall be
made by the Committee by implementing the nondiscriminatory and objective
standards set forth in Section 7.8(b) below.  In addition, a distribution under
this Section 7.8 shall (except for amounts attributable to 





                                     -63-

<PAGE>   71

Employer Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions which were not
designated as Qualified Nonelective Contributions) be limited to (1) Deferral
Contributions, (2) income allocable thereto, (3) Qualified Nonelective
Contributions, and (4) income allocable thereto (but only to the extent that the
preceding items (2)-(4) were credited to the Participant's Account on or before
June 30, 1989).

              (b)   A hardship distribution must be necessitated on account of
an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant.  Such an immediate and
heavy financial need exists for any of the following reasons: (1) the need to
pay for funeral expenses of a family member; (2) the need to pay for medical
care (as defined in Section 213(d) of the Code) previously incurred by the
Participant, the Participant's spouse or any dependents (as defined in Section
152 of the Code) or necessary for these persons to obtain medical care as
described in Section 213(d) of the Code; (3) to need to pay for costs directly
related to the purchase of a principal residence for the Participant (excluding
mortgage payments); (4) the need to pay for tuition and related educational fees
for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the Participant or the
Participant's spouse, children or dependents (as defined in Section 152 of the
Code); or (5) the need to make payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the
Participant from the Participant's principal residence or foreclosure on the
mortgage of that residence.





                                     -64-

<PAGE>   72

              A distribution will not be treated as necessary to satisfy an 
immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant to the extent the amount of
the distribution is in excess of the amount required to relieve the financial
need or to the extent such need may be satisfied from other resources that are
reasonably available to the Participant.  This determination generally is to be
made on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances.  A distribution
generally may be treated as necessary to satisfy a financial need if the
Signatory Company or Committee relies upon the Participant's written
representation, unless the Signatory Company or Committee, has actual knowledge
to the contrary, that the need cannot be reasonably relieved--

              (1)   Through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
         otherwise,

              (2)   By reasonable liquidation of the Participant's assets,

              (3)   By cessation of Deferral Contributions or After-Tax
         Employee Contributions under this Plan, or

              (4)   By other distributions, or nontaxable (at the time of the
         loan) loans from plans maintained by the Signatory Company or by any
         other employer, or by borrowing from commercial sources on reasonable
         commercial terms in an amount sufficient to satisfy the need.

              For purposes of this Section 7.8, the Participant's resources 
shall be deemed to include those assets of his spouse and minor children that
are reasonably available to the Participant.  Thus, for example, a vacation home
owned by the Participant and the Participant's spouse, whether as community
property, joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or tenants in common will be
deemed a resource of the





                                      -65-

<PAGE>   73
Participant.  However, property held for the Participant's child under an
irrevocable trust or under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act will not be treated
as a resource of the Participant.  The amount of an immediate and heavy
financial need may include any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or
local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the
distribution.  A need cannot reasonably be relieved by one of the actions
listed above if the effect would be to increase the amount of the need.  For
example, the need for funds to purchase a principal residence cannot reasonably
be relieved by a plan loan if the loan would disqualify the employee from
obtaining other necessary financing.

              (c)   If any distribution is made to a Participant from the 
portion of his Account attributable to Employer Contributions or Employer
Matching Contributions before such Participant has incurred five (5) consecutive
one-year Breaks-in-Service, and at a time when such Participant is less than
fully vested in such portion of his Account then, at any relevant time
thereafter, such Participant's vested percentage of such portion of his Account
shall be an amount ("X") determined by the formula:  X = P(AB+D) - D.  For
purposes of applying this formula:  P is the vested percentage at the relevant
time; AB is the Account balance at the relevant time, and D is the amount of 
the distribution.

         7.9     Distribution of After-Tax Employee Contributions.
Distribution of all or part of a Participant's Account attributable 





                                     -66-

<PAGE>   74

to After-Tax Employee Contributions and the earnings thereto shall be made to a
Participant upon request (pursuant to the application prescribed by the
Committee).  The distribution shall first be made with respect to the separate
subaccount maintained for After-Tax Employee Contributions made prior to
December 31, 1986 (plus earnings thereon).  This separate subaccount and
distribution therefrom shall be maintained and administered in an acceptable
manner that satisfies the requirements of IRS Notice 87-13, Q&A 14, 15 & 16.

         7.10    Missing Participants. If the Participant or Beneficiary to
whom a distribution under this Plan is to be made, cannot be located, after
reasonable efforts have been made to locate such individual, including notice
by certified mail to the last known address on file or known to the Committee,
the Committee, after a period of three years has elapsed since the
Participant's termination of employment from the Signatory Company, may take
either of the following actions in its sole discretion:

                 (a)      transfer the full amount of the benefit (after
         required tax withholdings) to a bank account opened at a bank selected
         by the Committee in the name of such individual even though through
         inactivity such bank account may eventually escheat to the state;

         or

                 (b)      treat the full Account balance (regardless of vested
         percentage) as a Forfeiture in the Plan Year in which the Committee
         takes the action and add such Forfeiture to all other Forfeitures of
         Employer Matching Contributions arising under Article VII, Section 7.6
         in such Plan Year; provided that in the event that such individual
         subsequently makes a claim for such benefits, the Forfeiture under
         this Section 7.10(b) shall be promptly restored (first from any other
         Forfeitures under Article VII, Section 7.6 arising in the Plan Year of
         such restoration, then from Employer Contributions for such Plan Year)
         and distributed to such individual in 





                                     -67-

<PAGE>   75

         accordance with the terms of the Plan and the applicable tax law in 
         effect at that time.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                            Claims for Plan Benefits

         8.1     Application for Benefits.  Each Participant or designated
Beneficiary claiming benefits under this Plan must make written  application
therefor following (whichever is applicable) the actual retirement, termination
of employment, death prior to retirement, determination of Total Permanent
Disability, or the happening of any other occurrence believed by the claimant
to entitle him to benefits hereunder.  The date the claim shall be considered
as filed shall be the date a properly completed application is received by the
Committee.  Each such application -- (a) shall be in writing on a form to be
provided by the Committee, (b) shall be signed by the claimant or his personal
representative, (c) shall be made to the Committee, and (d) shall be filed in
such a manner and with such persons as the Committee may specify.  The
Committee may require that there be furnished to it in connection with such
application all relevant information.  Failure to timely file such application
or to supply all relevant information shall not result in the forfeiting of any
rights claimed but shall excuse postponement of the orderly processing of such
claim and the time of commencing payment thereof.

         8.2     Processing of Claim.  Upon receipt by the Committee of a
properly completed application for benefits form, it shall be the duty and
responsibility of the Committee to verify the facts and claims made therein
with the appropriate Signatory Company and to determine whether the claim is
valid.  In arriving at a decision, 





                                     -68-

<PAGE>   76

the Committee may require additional relevant information from the claimant.
Following receipt of the application, the Committee shall determine whether,
when and in what amount distributions are to be paid from the Plan to the
claimant.  If the Committee fails to act on the claim in a reasonable time, the
claimant may proceed to the review stage described in Section 8.4 hereof as if
the claim had been denied.

         8.3     Notification to Claimant of Decision.  If distributions are to
be made, the Committee shall immediately notify the claimant and the Trustee of
the amount and method of payment.  It shall then be the responsibility of the
Trustee to arrange the distribution.  If the claim is denied, in whole or in
part, the Committee shall send written notice of the denial to the claimant.  A
notice that a claim has been denied shall set forth, in a manner calculated to
be understood by the claimant:

                 (a)      The specific reason or reasons for the denial;

                 (b)      Specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions
         on which the denial was based;

                 (c)      A description of any additional material or
         information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
         explanation of why such material is necessary; and

                 (d)      An explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.

         8.4     Review Procedure.  A claimant shall be entitled to a full and
fair review of a denial of claim for benefits.  To avail himself of this right,
the claimant, or his duly authorized representative, must timely file an
application for review with the Committee.  Such application must be in writing
and must be filed within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice of denial of





                                     -69-

<PAGE>   77

benefits.  If the claimant desires a personal appearance or hearing before the
Committee to present his case, he shall so state in his application for review. 
An appeal shall be considered as filed on the date it is received by the
Committee.  Subsequent to the filing of an appeal and prior to the rendering of
a decision thereon, the claimant, or his duly authorized representative, may
review pertinent documents and may submit issues and comments in writing.  If a
hearing is held, the claimant may be represented thereat by legal counsel or
other duly authorized representative.

         8.5     Decision on Review.  The Committee shall render a decision no
later than sixty (60) days after its receipt of a request for review unless
special circumstances, such as the need to hold a hearing, require an extension
of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as
possible, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a
request for review.  The decision for review shall be in writing and shall
include the specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated
to be understood by the claimant, with specific reference to the pertinent Plan
provisions on which the decision is based.  The review decision by the Committee
shall be considered final.

         8.6     Disputed Benefits.  If any dispute shall arise between a
Participant, or other person claiming under a Participant, and the Committee
after the review of the claim for benefits, or if any dispute shall develop as
to the person to whom the payment of any benefit under the Plan shall be made,
the Trustee may withhold payment of all or any part of the benefits payable
hereunder to the 





                                     -70-

<PAGE>   78

Participant, or other person claiming under the Participant, until such dispute
has been resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by the parties
involved.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                         Distributions from Trust Funds

         9.1     Occasions for Distributions.  Distributions from the Trust
shall be made to Participants or Beneficiaries only following the occurrence of
one of the following events:

         (1)     the Participant's death, retirement on or after Normal
                 Retirement Age, or Total Permanent Disability as provided in
                 Article VII, Sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 hereof, respectively;

         (2)     termination of employment as provided in Article VII, Section
                 7.5 hereof;

         (3)     hardship as provided in Article VII, Section 7.8 hereof;

         (4)     the Participant's election to withdraw After-Tax Employee
                 Contributions under Article VII, Section 7.9 hereof; or

         (5)     termination of the Plan and Trust as provided in Article XVI.

         All distribution events set forth above are subject to the conditions
and specifications set forth hereafter in this Article IX.

         9.2     Special Prohibition Against Distribution.  In those instances
where a Participant severs his employment with the Signatory Company for any
reason other than death or attainment of his Normal Retirement Date, and, as a
result thereof, would otherwise be entitled to a distribution of his vested
interest in the After-Tax Employee Contributions, Deferral Contributions,
Employer Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions in his 





                                     -71-

<PAGE>   79

Account, no such distribution shall, under any circumstances, be authorized by
the Committee nor effected by the Trustee prior to the death or attainment of
Normal Retirement Date of such Participant unless (i) the gross amount to be
distributed is $3,500 or less, or (ii) the gross amount is in excess of $3,500
and the Participant consents to the distribution and executes a consent to
distribution form supplied by the Committee signifying such consent.  A
certified copy of such consent to distribution form shall be transmitted to the
Trustee for its records along with written directions as to the amount, time and
manner of distribution.

         If any reemployed Employee is reemployed before incurring five (5)
consecutive Years of Break-in-Service, and such Employee had received prior to
his reemployment an entire distribution of  the vested portion of his Account
which was less than fully vested, the forfeited portion of his Account shall be
reinstated only if he repays the full amount distributed to him, other than his
voluntary Employee Contributions, before the end of the earlier of the following
periods:  (a) five (5) consecutive Years of Break-in-Service, or (b) the period
ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Participant's reemployment.  A
reemployed Participant who previously had a zero vested Account balance and thus
received a deemed zero distribution under Article VII, Section 7.6 shall be
deemed to have repaid his prior deemed zero distribution, on the day of his
reemployment.  If a reemployed Employee repays such full amount distributed to
him, the undistributed portion of his Account must be restored in full,
unadjusted by any gains or losses 





                                     -72-

<PAGE>   80

occurring subsequent to the valuation date preceding his termination.  Such
restoration shall be paid from Employer Contributions, Forfeitures and income or
gain to the Plan for the Plan Year of such restoration, as determined by the
Committee.  This provision shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
transitional rules of Section 303(a)(2) of the Retirement Equity Act as to
service prior to Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1985.

         9.3     Manner of Distributions.  The Committee shall direct the
Trustee, in writing, when to distribute the amounts referred to in Article VII,
Sections 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.8 and 7.9 in a lump sum payment in cash.  In the
event of the Participant's death, the benefit shall be paid in a lump sum
payment in cash to the Beneficiary designated as set forth on the beneficiary
designation on file with the Committee pursuant to Article VI, Section 6.2.

         9.4     Time of Distributions.  Distributions under Section 9.3 of
this Article IX shall commence as soon as administratively feasible.  Unless
the Participant executes an election form consented to by the Committee which
states how and when benefits are to commence, payment of benefits to the
Participant shall in no event begin later than the sixtieth (60th) day after
the latest of the close of the Plan Year in which:

                 (a)      the Participant attains age 65,

                 (b)      the Participant has his tenth (10th) anniversary of
         the year in which he commenced participation in the Plan, and

                 (c)      the Participant's employment with a Signatory Company
         terminates.





                                     -73-

<PAGE>   81

         9.5     Mandatory Distributions.  Notwithstanding any other provision
in the Plan to the contrary, benefits shall be distributed to the Participant
or his Beneficiary no later than set forth in this section.

                 (a)      Mandatory Age Distribution.  A Participant's benefits
         shall be distributed to him in a lump sum no later than the April 1st
         of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
         Participant attains age 70 1/2.  In the event the Plan is ever amended
         to provide for a distribution in installments such installments shall
         be distributed over a time period not exceeding the Participant's life
         expectancy (or the life expectancies of the Participant and his
         designated Beneficiary).

                 (b)      Mandatory Death Distribution.  In the event the Plan
         is ever amended to provide for a distribution in installments and such
         installments are being distributed over a fixed term and, if the
         distribution of the Participant's benefits had commenced pursuant to
         Section 9.5(a) and the Participant dies before his entire benefit is
         distributed to him, the remaining portion of his benefit will be
         distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution
         being used pursuant to Section 9.5(a) as of the date of such
         Participant's death.  If a Participant dies prior to the commencement
         of his benefit distribution pursuant to Section 9.5(a), the entire
         benefit of such Participant will be distributed within five (5) years
         after the death of such Participant.  However, such five (5) year rule
         shall be disregarded for any portion of the Participant's benefit
         which is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated Beneficiary,
         such portion to be distributed (in accordance with regulations issued
         by the Secretary) over the life of such designated Beneficiary (or
         over a period not exceeding beyond the life expectancy of such
         Beneficiary), and such distributions commence not later than one (1)
         year after the date of the Participant's death or such later date as
         the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.  In such a situation, the
         benefit portion distributed to such Beneficiary shall be treated as
         distributed on the date on which such distribution begins.

                 In the event that the designated Beneficiary is the deceased
         Participant's surviving spouse, the date on which the benefit
         distribution is required to commence shall be no earlier than the date
         on which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2.  If the
         surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse
         commence, this subsection shall be applied as if the 





                                     -74-

<PAGE>   82

         surviving spouse were the Participant.  For purposes of this
         subsection, any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had
         been paid to the surviving spouse if such amount shall become payable
         to the surviving spouse upon such child reaching majority (or other
         designated event permitted under Treasury regulations).

                 Distributions under this section shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code including the minimum
         distribution incidental benefit requirements of Section 1.401(a)(9)-2
         of the proposed Treasury regulations.

                 (c)      Prior Irrevocable Election.  If the Participant made
         an irrevocable election prior to December 31, 1983 to defer the
         distribution of benefits beyond the dates set forth in Section 9.5(a)
         and (b), such election shall govern the distribution so long as said
         election was pursuant to the terms of the Plan at the time of the
         election.

                 (d)      Recalculation of Life Expectancies.  For purposes of
         this Section, the life expectancy of a Participant and a Participant's
         spouse may, in the discretion of the Committee, be redetermined but no
         more frequently than annually and in accordance with such rules as may
         be prescribed by Treasury regulations.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Plan shall in
all respects comply with the provisions of Prop. Reg.  Section 1.401(a)(9)-1,
which are specifically incorporated herein by reference.

         9.6     Distribution to Minors or Persons under Disability.  Should
any distribution hereunder become payable to a minor or to a person who, in the
opinion of the Committee, is incapable of taking care of his affairs, the
Committee may direct the Trustee to make such distribution in any one or
combination of the following ways:  (1) directly to such minor or person; (2)
to the legal guardian of the person or estate of such minor or person; or
(3) to a person or financial institution serving as Custodian for such
Beneficiary under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act of any state.  





                                     -75-

<PAGE>   83

Any distribution so made shall constitute full and complete discharge of any
liability under the Plan with respect to the amount so distributed.

         9.7     Community Property Interests - Interest of Spouse of
Participant in the Event of Divorce.  In the event of a divorce between a
Participant and his spouse and in the event that the Divorce Decree entered by
the Court having jurisdiction in the matter gives such divorced spouse a
portion of the Participant's vested interest in his Account, the Trustee shall,
pursuant to the direction of the Committee, segregate such amount in a separate
account for the benefit of such spouse.  Such account shall thereafter be held
and administered as a part of the Trust Fund (but such account shall only share
in income allocations and valuation adjustments of the Trust Fund) until such
time as the Participant or his Beneficiary becomes entitled to a distribution
hereunder or pursuant to Section 414(p)(3) of the Code.  In the event the
spouse is also awarded a portion of the future After-Tax Employee
Contributions, Deferral Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions or
Employer Contributions which normally would be allocated to the Participant's
Account, the Committee, after it receives a certified copy of such Divorce
Decree, shall instruct the Trustee to allocate such portion to the spouse's
account.  At the time the Participant or his Beneficiary becomes entitled to a
distribution hereunder, the amounts held by the Trustee for the spouse shall be
distributed to such spouse in a lump sum.  If such spouse should die prior to
the time of distribution to such spouse hereunder, such amounts then held by
the Trustee shall be paid over 





                                     -76-

<PAGE>   84

to the beneficiary designated (if any) by the spouse (in accordance with the
procedures prescribed by the Committee for this purpose) or if none then to the
estate of such spouse.  All rights and benefits, including elections, provided
to a Participant in this Plan shall be subject to the rights afforded to any
"alternate payee" under a "qualified domestic relations order (QDRO)" as those
terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.

         The Committee shall have the authority to make a distribution from
this Plan to the alternative payee under the QDRO at a time earlier than either
(a) that provided under Article IX of this Plan or (b) the "earliest retirement
age" as defined in Section 414(b)(4)(B) of the Code or (c) both, if such
distribution is both pursuant to the express terms of the QDRO and consistent
with and permissible under Section 401(a) and (b) of the Code and Section
414(p)(10) of the Code and the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 Joint
Committee Explanation (p. 227 of Technical Corrections Provisions).

         9.8     Incorporation of Revenue Procedure 93-12 Model Amendment.
This Section 9.8 applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise
limit a distributee's election under this Section 9.8, a distributee may elect
at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Committee, to have any portion
of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement
plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.

         a)      Eligible rollover distribution:  For purposes of this Section
                 9.8, an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of
                 all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the
                 distributee, except 





                                     -77-

<PAGE>   85

                 that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
                 any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
                 periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
                 the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint
                 lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
                 distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period
                 of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such
                 distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code;
                 and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in
                 gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for
                 net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
                 securities).

         b)      Eligible retirement plan:  For purposes of this Section 9.8,
                 an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement
                 account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual
                 retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an
                 annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a
                 qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that
                 accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
                 However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to
                 the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an
                 individual retirement account or individual retirement
                 annuity.

         c)      Distributee:  For purposes of this Section 9.8, a distributee
                 includes an employee or former employee.  In addition, the
                 employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the 
                 employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is
                 the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order,
                 as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees 
                 with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

         d)      Direct rollover:  For purposes of this Section 9.8, a direct
                 rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement
                 plan specified by the distributee.

                              Top Heavy Provisions

         10.1    Determination of Top Heavy Plan Status.  The Plan shall be
considered a Top Heavy Plan for any Plan Year in which, as of  the
Determination Date, the sum of the Aggregate Accounts of Key 





                                     -78-

<PAGE>   86

Employees under this Plan and any plan of an Aggregation Group exceeds sixty
percent (60%) of the Aggregate Accounts of all Participants under this Plan and
any plan of an Aggregation Group.  If a Participant, who was a Key Employee for
any prior Plan Year, is a Non-Key Employee for any Plan Year, such Participant's
Aggregate Account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation
Group which includes the Plan is a Top Heavy Group).  In addition, the Account
balance of any Participant who has not within the past five (5) years performed
any services for the Signatory Company shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan (or whether any
Aggregation Group which includes the Plan is a Top Heavy Group).

         10.2    Determination of Super Top Heavy Plan Status.  The Plan shall
be considered a Super Top Heavy Plan for any Plan Year in which, as of the
Determination Date, the sum of the Aggregate Accounts of Key Employees under
this Plan and any plan of an Aggregation Group exceeds ninety percent (90%) of
the Aggregate Accounts of all Participants under this Plan and any plan of an
Aggregation Group.  For purposes of determining if the Plan is a Super Top
Heavy Plan, a Participant's inclusion in the Key Employee grouping shall be
determined in the manner set forth in Section 10.1.

         10.3    Aggregate Accounts.  A Participant's Aggregate Account as of
the Determination Date shall be the sum of:





                                     -79-

<PAGE>   87

                 (a)      his Account balance as of the most recent valuation
         date occurring within a twelve (12) month period ending on the
         Determination Date;

                 (b)      an adjustment for any contributions due as of the
         Determination Date.  Such adjustment shall be the amount of any
         contributions actually made after the valuation date but before the
         Determination Date, except for the first Plan Year when such
         adjustment shall also reflect the amount of any contributions made
         after the Determination Date that are allocated as of a date in that
         first Plan Year;

                 (c)      any Plan distributions made within the Plan Year that
         includes the Determination Date or within the four (4) preceding Plan
         Years.  However, in the case of distributions made after the valuation
         date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not
         included as distributions for top heavy purposes to the extent that
         such distributions are already included in the Participant's Aggregate
         Account balance as of the valuation date.  Notwithstanding anything
         herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions
         made prior to January 1, 1984, will be counted, and distributions
         under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated would have
         been required to be included in an Aggregation Group will be counted; 
         and

                 (d)      any Employee contributions, whether voluntary or
         mandatory.  However, amounts attributable to tax deductible qualified
         Employee contributions shall not be considered to be a part of the
         Participant's Aggregate Account balance.

         10.4    Aggregation Group.  An Aggregation Group for purposes of this
article is either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation
Group as hereinafter determined.  In determining Aggregation Groups, "Employer"
means an employer as defined in Section 416 of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder.

                 (a)      Required Aggregation Group.  In determining a
         Required Aggregation Group hereunder, each plan of the Employer in
         which a Key Employee is a participant, and each other plan of the
         Employer which enables any plan in which a Key Employee participates
         to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) or 410, will be
         required to be aggregated.  Such group shall be known as a Required
         Aggregation Group.  In the case of a Required Aggregation Group, each
         plan in the group will be considered a Top Heavy Plan if the Required
         Aggregation 





                                     -80-

<PAGE>   88

         Group is a Top Heavy Group.  No plan in the Required Aggregation Group
         will be considered a Top Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group 
         is not a Top Heavy Group.

                 (b)      Permissive Aggregation Group.  The Employer may also
         include any other plan not required to be included in the Required
         Aggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole,
         would continue to satisfy the provisions of Code Sections 401(a)(4) or
         410.  Such group shall be known as a Permissive Aggregation Group.  In
         the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part
         of the Required Aggregation Group will be considered a Top Heavy Plan
         if the Permissive Aggregation Group is a Top Heavy Group.  No plan in
         the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a Top Heavy Plan
         if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top Heavy Group.

                 (c)      Aggregation of Multiple Plans.  When more than one
         plan is aggregated, the Aggregate Accounts (including distributions
         for Key Employees and all Employees) are determined separately for
         each plan as of each plan's Determination Date.  The plans are then
         aggregated by adding the results of each plan as of the Determination
         Dates for such plans that fall within the same calendar year.

         10.5    Top Heavy Plan Requirements.  For any Plan Year in which the
Plan is considered to be a Top Heavy Plan, the Plan shall:

                 (a)      limit the Considered Compensation maximum dollar
         amount pursuant to Article I, Section 1.13;

                 (b)      require minimum allocations to Non-Key Employees 
         pursuant to Section 10.6; and

                 (c)      vest Participant Accounts under a schedule no less
         favorable than the following:

         10.6    Allocations to Non-Key Employees.  For any Plan Year in which
the Plan is determined to be a Top Heavy Plan, the following allocation
provisions shall be operational and shall supplement Article IV, Section 4.4.

                 (a)      Minimum Allocations Required for Top Heavy Plan
         Years.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Top Heavy Plan Year,
         the sum of the Employer Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions
         and Deferral Contributions allocated to the Participant's Account of
         each Non-Key Employee shall be equal to at least three percent (3%) of
         such Non-Key Employee's Considered Compensation.  However, should the
         sum of the Employer's contributions allocated to the Participant's
         Account of each Key Employee for such Top Heavy Plan Year be less than
         three percent (3%) of each Key Employee's Considered Compensation, the
         sum of the Employer Contributions allocated to the Participant's
         Account of each Non-Key Employee shall be equal to the largest
         percentage allocated to the Participant's Account of any Key Employee.
         For allocation purposes, where contributions to Key Employees are less
         than three percent (3%) of Considered Compensation amounts contributed
         by Key Employees to a salary deferral plan must be included as part of
         such Key Employee's Considered Compensation for purposes of
         determining contributions made on behalf of Key Employees.

                 (b)      Extra Minimum Allocation Permitted for Top Heavy
         Plans other than Super Top Heavy Plans.  If a Key Employee is a
         Participant in both a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit
         pension plan that are both part of a Top Heavy Group (but neither of
         such plans is a Super Top Heavy Plan), the defined contribution and
         the defined benefit fractions set forth in Article V, Section 5.2
         shall remain unchanged, provided the Participant's Account of each
         Non-Key Employee who is a Participant receives an extra allocation (in
         addition to the minimum allocation set forth above) equal to not less
         than one percent (1%) of such Non-Key Employee's Considered
         Compensation.

                 (c)      Computation of the Minimum Contribution.  For
         purposes of the minimum allocations set forth above, the percentage
         allocated to the Participant's Account of any Key Employee shall be
         equal to the ratio of the sum of 





                                     -82-

<PAGE>   90

         the Employer Contribution, Employer Matching Contribution and
         Deferral Contribution allocated on behalf of such Key Employee divided
         by the Considered Compensation for such Key Employee.

                 (d)      Eligibility for the Minimum Contribution.  For any
         Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, the minimum
         allocations set forth above shall be allocated to the Accounts of all
         Non-Key Employees who are Participants and who are employed by the
         Employer on the last day of the Plan Year, including Non-Key Employees
         who are Participants but have failed to complete a Year of Service
         regardless of compensation.

                 (e)      Alternative Methods of Complying with the Minimum
         Benefit Requirement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
         in any Plan Year in which a Non-Key Employee is a Participant in both
         this Plan and a defined benefit pension plan, and both such plans are
         Top Heavy Plans, the Employer shall not be required to provide a
         Non-Key Employee with both the full separate minimum defined benefit
         plan benefit and the full separate defined contribution plan
         allocations.  Therefore, for Non-Key Employees who are participating
         in a defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer and the minimum
         benefits under Section 416(c)(2) of the Code are accruing to a Non-
         Key Employee under such Plan, the minimum allocations provided for
         above shall not be applicable, and no minimum contribution shall be
         made to the Plan on behalf of the Non-Key Employee.  Alternatively,
         the Employer may satisfy the minimum benefit requirement of Section
         416(c)(1)(E) of the Code for the Non-Key Employee by providing any
         combination of benefits and/or contributions that satisfy the safe
         harbor rules contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.416-1(M-12).

                 (f)      Accounting.  The Committee may establish a second
         Account for each Participant to which allocations are credited for
         Plan Years in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan or a Super Top Heavy
         Plan.  Such separate Accounts shall be credited with income
         allocations and earning adjustments pursuant to Article IV, Section
         4.5 and 4.6.  Contributions to each Participant's top heavy Account
         shall be invested pursuant to such Participant's instruction regarding
         the investment of his Deferral Contributions, Employer Matching
         Contributions (if any), Employer Contributions (if any) and his
         non-top heavy Account.

                             Other Qualified Plans

         11.1    Transfers from Other Qualified Plans.  The Committee may give
its consent to the transfer of assets to this Plan and Trust from any other
corporate qualified plan meeting the requirements of Section 401(a) of the
Code, provided that the Employee requesting such transfer is an Eligible
Employee as defined in Article I, Section 1.19 and Article II, Section 2.1 and
that no such transfer shall be permitted if such assets are subject to the
joint and survivor annuity requirements of Section 401(a)(11) of the Code.

         11.2    Transfers to Other Qualified Plans.  Subject to the provisions
of Article IX, Section 9.8, the Committee may, upon written request of a
Participant otherwise entitled to receive a distribution of benefits under
Article IX, direct the Trustee to transfer the vested amount of such
Participant's Account hereunder to another qualified plan meeting the
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code which is maintained by the Signatory
Company or a successor employer of the Participant and which makes provision
for receiving such transferred assets.  Prior to the transfer of any assets,
the Trustee must be satisfied that the holding of such assets is permitted in
the transferee trust.  Upon receipt of such written instructions, the Trustee
shall effect the transfer of the Participant's Account.  Such transferred
assets shall be credited to such Participant's Account in the transferee plan
and trust as a fully vested portion thereof.

                                  ARTICLE XII.

                                   Committee

         12.1    Appointment, Resignation and Removal.  The Company shall be
the named fiduciary under Section 402(a) of the Act, having authority to
control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan.  The Board of
Directors shall appoint in writing a Committee of one or more persons, the
members of which shall serve until resignation, death or removal.  Any member
of the Committee may resign at any time by mailing or delivering written notice
of such resignation to the Board of Directors thirty (30) days before the
effective date of such resignation.  Such notice may be waived by written
consent of the Company.  Any member of the Committee may be removed by the
Board of Directors with or without cause.  Vacancies in the Committee arising
by resignation, death, removal or otherwise shall be filled by such persons as
may be appointed by the Board of Directors.

         12.2    Rights, Powers and Authority.  The Committee shall have
general supervision of the administration of the Plan and Trust according to
the terms and provisions of the Plan and shall have all powers necessary to
accomplish such purposes, including, but not limited to, the right, power,
discretion and authority:

                 (a)      To make rules and regulations for the administration
         of the Plan and Trust which are not inconsistent with the terms and
         provisions hereof; provided, that such rules and regulations are
         evidenced in writing and copies thereof are delivered (where
         applicable) to the Trustee and to each Signatory Company;

                 (b)      To construe in its sole and absolute discretion in a
         manner that is not arbitrary or capricious, all terms, provisions,
         conditions and limitations of the Plan and Trust; and its construction
         thereof, shall be final and conclusive on all parties at interest;





                                     -85-

<PAGE>   93

                 (c)      To correct any defect or supply any omission or
         reconcile any inconsistency which may appear in the Plan and Trust, in
         such manner and to such extent as it shall deem expedient to carry the
         Plan and Trust into effect for the greatest benefit of all parties in
         interest, and its judgment of such expediency shall be final and
         conclusive on all parties at interest;

                 (d)      To select, employ and compensate from time to time
         such consultants, actuaries, accountants, attorneys and other agents
         and employees as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable for the
         proper and efficient administration of the Plan or Trust; and any
         agent or employee so selected by the Committee may be a person or firm
         then, theretofore, or thereafter serving any Signatory Company in any
         capacity;

                 (e)      To determine in its sole and absolute discretion in a
         manner that is not arbitrary or capricious all questions relating to
         the eligibility of Employees to become Participants, and to determine
         the Years of Service and the amount of Considered Compensation upon
         which the benefits of each Participant shall be calculated;

                 (f)      To determine all questions in its sole and absolute
         discretion in a manner that is not arbitrary or capricious relating to
         the administration of the Plan and Trust; including, but not limited
         to, differences of opinion which may arise between a Signatory
         Company, the Trustee, a Participant or any of them; and, whenever it
         is deemed advisable, to determine such questions in order to promote
         the uniform and nondiscriminatory administration of the Plan and Trust
         for the benefit of Participants and to the extent appropriate other
         parties at interest; and

                 (g)      To direct and instruct the Trustee in all matters
         relating to the payment of Plan benefits.

         12.3    Administration.  Whenever, in the administration of the Plan,
any action is taken by the Committee, such action shall be uniform in nature as
applied to all persons similarly situated and no such action shall be taken
which will improperly discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated Eligible
Employees.  The Committee shall keep records containing all relevant data
pertaining to individual Participants and their rights under the Plan and is





                                     -86-

<PAGE>   94

charged with the duty of seeing that Participant receives the benefits to which
he is entitled.  Any Employee may consult with the Committee on any matter or
matters relating to the Plan.  The Committee shall supply each Participant with
a designation of beneficiary form which may be completed and signed by the
Participant pursuant to Article VI, Section 6.2 and filed with the Committee,
and with any other forms it shall require in connection with the administration
of the Plan.

         12.4    Annual Audit of Plan.  Unless otherwise relieved of the
responsibility to file audited financial statements with the Department of
Labor, if the Plan has one hundred (100) or more Participants, it shall be the
duty and responsibility of the Committee to engage, on behalf of all
Participants, an independent Certified Public Accountant who shall conduct an
annual examination of any financial statements of the Plan and Trust and of
other books and records of the Plan and Trust as the Certified Public Accountant
may deem necessary to enable him to form and provide a written opinion as to
whether the financial statements and related schedules required to be filed with
the Department of Labor or furnished to each Participant are presented fairly
and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
basis consistent with that of the preceding Plan Year.  Such examination shall
be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and shall
involve such tests of the books and records of the Plan and Trust as the
Certified Public Accountant considers necessary.  However, if the statements
required to be submitted as part of the reports to the Department 





                                     -87-

<PAGE>   95

of Labor are prepared by a bank or similar institution or insurance carrier
regulated and supervised and subject to periodic examination by a state or
federal agency and if such statements are certified by the preparer as accurate
and if such statements are, in fact, made a part of the annual report to the
Department of Labor, then the examination required by the foregoing provisions
of this section shall (to the extent permitted by law) be optional with the
Committee.

         12.5    Chairman and Secretary.  The Committee shall select a Chairman
from among its members who shall preside at all meetings of the Committee and
who shall be authorized to execute all documents in the name of the Committee.
In addition, it shall select a Secretary or his designee who may or may not be
a member of the Committee and who shall keep the minutes of the Committee's
proceedings and all records, documents and data pertaining to the Committee's
supervision of the administration of the Plan and Trust.

         12.6    Quorum and Voting Majority.  A majority of the members of the
Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the
vote of a majority of the members present and voting at any meeting shall
decide any question brought before such meeting.  The Committee may decide any
question by the vote, taken without a meeting, of a majority of its members.

         12.7    Limitation on Voting.  A member of the Committee who is also a
Participant hereunder shall not vote or act upon any matter relating solely to
himself.





                                     -88-

<PAGE>   96

         12.8    Delegation of Rights, Powers and Duties.  The Chairman or the
Secretary of the Committee may execute any certificate or other written
evidence of the action of the Committee.  The Committee may delegate any of its
rights, powers, and duties to any one or more of its members, including the
power to execute any document on behalf of the Committee, in which event the
Committee shall notify the Trustee, in writing, of such action and the name or
names of its members so designated.  The Trustee thereafter shall accept and
may rely upon any document executed by such member or members as representing
action by the Committee until the Committee shall file with the Trustee a
written revocation of such designation.

         12.9    Liability.  Except to the extent that such liability is
created by Section 405 of the Act, no member of the Committee shall be liable
for any act or omission of any other member of the Committee, nor for any act
or omission on his own part, except for his own gross negligence or willful
misconduct, nor for the exercise of any power or discretion in the performance
of any duty assumed by him hereunder.

         12.10   Compensation and Expense.  The members of the Committee shall
serve without compensation for their services, but all expenses of the
Committee, including premiums for bonds for each member thereof as required by
Section 12.11 hereof, shall be paid by each Signatory Company in the proportion
that the total amount in the Accounts of the Participants of such Signatory
Company bears to the total amount in the Accounts of the Participants of all
Signatory Companies; provided, however, that at the election of all of the
Signatory Companies, such expenses (except the premiums for 





                                     -89-

<PAGE>   97

the required bonds under Section 12.11) may be paid from the Trust Fund.

         12.11   Bonds.  Each and every member of the Committee and their
designated Employees shall be required to give bond or be covered by a bond
obtained by the Company for this purpose for the faithful performance of his
duties, the amount of which shall be fixed at the beginning of each Plan Year.
The amount of each bond shall be determined annually by the Board of Directors
but shall not be less than ten percent (10%) of the amount of funds handled.
Unless otherwise required by the Secretary of Labor, however, no bond shall be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000).  For purposes of fixing the amount of the bond, the amount
of funds handled shall be determined by the funds handled by the Committee
during the preceding Plan Year, or, if the Plan had no preceding Plan Year, the
amount of funds to be handled during the current Plan Year by the Committee.
The bond shall provide protection to the Plan against loss by reason of acts of
fraud or dishonesty on the part of the members of the Committee (or their
designees), directly or through connivance with others.

         12.12   Indemnity.  The Signatory Companies shall indemnify and save
the members of the Committee and their designated Employees, and each of them,
harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses (including counsel
fees approved by the Committee) and liabilities (including any amounts paid in
settlement with the Committee's approval) or other effects and consequences
arising from any act, omission or conduct in their 





                                     -90-

<PAGE>   98

official capacity, except when the same is judicially determined to be due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such member.  Any amounts paid or
owing under this Section 12.12 shall be considered as an expense of the
Committee to be paid by the respective Signatory Companies as provided in
Section 12.10 hereof.  It is expressly provided, however, that any excise tax
assessed against any member or members of the Committee pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4975 of the Code shall not, for the purposes of this Plan
and Trust, be considered an expense of the Committee to be paid by the Signatory
Companies as hereinabove provided.

         12.13   Reporting and Disclosure.  The Committee shall file or cause
to be filed with the appropriate office of the Internal Revenue Service and the
Department of Labor all reports, returns, notices and other information
required under the Act or Code, including, but not limited to, the plan
description, summary plan description, annual reports and amendments thereto,
requests for determination letters, annual reports and registration statements
required by Section 6057(a) of the Code, returns and reports required by
Section 6047(c) of the Code, and shall provide the Participants and their
Beneficiaries with such information as may be required by the Act or Code.
Nothing contained in this Plan shall give any Participant or Beneficiary the
right to examine any data or records reflecting the compensation paid to any
other Participant or Beneficiary.

         12.14   Statement to Participants.  Within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the end of each Plan quarter (or other period designated), the
Committee shall transmit to each Participant or 





                                     -91-

<PAGE>   99

Beneficiary a written statement showing, as of the end of such Plan quarter:

                 (a)      The balance in his Account as of the last day of the
         preceding Plan quarter;

                 (b)      The amount of After-Tax Employee Contributions,
         Deferral Contributions, and Employer Matching Contributions (if any)
         and Employer Contributions (if any) allocated to his Account for such
         Plan quarter;

                 (c)      The adjustment of his Account to reflect his share of
         the income, valuation adjustments and expenses of the Trust for such
         Plan quarter;

                 (d)      The new balance in his Account; and

                 (e)      Such other information as may be required under the
         Code and regulations thereunder.

         12.15   Signatory Company to Supply Information.  To enable the
Committee to perform its functions, the Signatory Company shall supply full and
timely information to the Committee on all matters relating to the compensation
of all Participants, their Hours of Service, their Years of Service, their
retirement, death, disability, or termination of employment and such other
pertinent facts as the Committee may require; and the Committee shall advise
the Trustee of such of the foregoing facts as may be pertinent to the Trustee's
duties under the Plan.  The Committee may rely upon such information as is
supplied by the Signatory Company and shall have no duty or responsibility to
verify such information.

                                 ARTICLE XIII.

                                    Trustee

         13.1    Acceptance and Holding of Funds.  The Trustee shall retain,
manage, administer and hold the Trust Fund in accordance  with the terms of
this Plan and Trust.  The Trustee shall receive any securities or other
property that are tendered to the Trustee 





                                     -92-

<PAGE>   100

and that the Trustee deems acceptable.  The Trustee shall have no duty to compel
any contribution to the Trust Fund by a Signatory Company.

         13.2    Responsibility for Actions.  The Trustee shall not be
responsible for any acts or omissions of the Committee and may assume that the
Committee is discharging its duties under this Plan until and unless it is
notified to the contrary, in writing, by any person known to be a Participant
of the Plan or by a Signatory Company.  If the Trustee receives such notice,
the Trustee may exercise its own discretion and may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for guidance with respect to the disposition of the
Trust Fund or any other matter.  Any powers granted to the Trustee that are to
be exercised according to the direction of the Committee shall be exercised by
the Trustee exactly as directed by the Committee in a written instrument signed
by the person or persons authorized to sign for the Committee and delivered to
the Trustee.  The Trustee shall have absolutely no liability for any loss or
breach of trust of any kind which may result from any action or failure of
action due to its compliance with written direction from the Committee (whether
or not such action is to be taken solely at the direction of the Committee) or
for a failure on the part of the Committee to give a written direction properly
or within a required period of time.  The Trustee may accept as true all papers,
certificates, statements and representations of fact that are presented to it
without investigation or verification if the Trustee believes them to be
genuine, to have been signed by the Committee and to be the act of the
Committee, and may rely solely 





                                     -93-

<PAGE>   101

on the written advice of the Committee on any question of fact.  If at any time
the Committee shall fail to give directions or instructions to the Trustee or to
express its consent and approval to proposed action within a reasonable time
after consent and approval is requested by the Trustee, the Trustee, although
being under no obligation to do so, may act (and shall be protected in so
acting) without such directions, instructions, consent or approval and may
exercise its own discretion and judgment as seems appropriate and advisable
under the circumstances in order to effectuate the purposes of this Plan.

         13.3    Resolutions of Board of Directors.  The Trustee shall be fully
protected in relying upon a resolution of the Board of Directors, duly
certified by the Company's secretary or assistant secretary, as to the
membership of the Committee until a subsequent resolution is filed with the
Trustee by the Board of Directors.

         13.4    Judicial Protection.  The Trustee may seek judicial protection
for any action or proceeding it deems necessary to settle the accounts of the
Trustee; a judicial determination or a declaratory judgment as to a question of
construction of the Plan or Trust; or judicial instruction as to action under
this Plan or Trust.  The Trustee need join only the Committee and the Signatory
Company as parties defendant although the Trustee may join other parties.  The
district court of Harris County, Texas, shall have jurisdiction and venue in
all such matters.

         13.5    Dealings with Third Parties.  No person dealing with the
Trustee shall be required to verify the application by the Trustee for Trust
purposes of any money paid or other property delivered to 





                                     -94-

<PAGE>   102

the Trustee.  All persons dealing with the Trustee shall be entitled to rely
upon the representations of the Trustee as to its authority and are released
from any duty of inquiry with respect thereto.  Any action of the Trustee
hereunder shall be conclusively evidenced for all purposes of this Plan and
Trust by a certificate duly signed by the Trustee, and such certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of the facts recited therein and shall fully protect all
persons relying upon the truth thereof.  Any person dealing with the Trustee in
good faith shall not be required to inquire whether the Committee has instructed
the Trustee or whether the Trustee is otherwise authorized to take or omit any
action.  Any such person shall be fully protected in acting upon any notice,
resolution, instruction, direction, order, certificate, opinion, letter,
telegram or other document believed by such person to be genuine, to have been
signed by the Trustee and to be the act of the Trustee.

         13.6    Annual Accounting by Trustee.  At the times mutually agreed
upon with the Committee, the Trustee shall render to the Committee and to each
Signatory Company a written accounting of its administration of the Trust Fund
showing all receipts and disbursements during the preceding Plan Year and the
market value of the assets of the Trust Fund as of the end of such Plan Year.
The written approval of any accounting by the Committee as to all matters and
transactions stated or shown therein relating to the Trust shall be final and
binding upon the Committee, each Signatory Company and upon all persons who
shall then be or shall thereafter become interested in such Trust and the
Trustee shall be released 





                                     -95-

<PAGE>   103

and discharged as to all items, matters and things set forth in such accounting
as if such accounting had been settled by decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.  The failure of the Committee to notify the Trustee of its
disapproval of such accounting within ninety (90) days after receipt of any such
accounting shall be equivalent to written approval.  The Trustee shall have,
nevertheless, the right to have its accounts settled by judicial proceeding. 
The records of the Trustee as to the Trust Fund may be inspected by the
Committee or Signatory Company during normal business hours of the Trustee.

         13.7    Preparation of Statement to Participants.  The Trustee shall
provide any assistance and information requested by the Committee in
conjunction with the preparation of the statements to Participants in
accordance with Section 12.14.

         13.8    Resignation of Trustee.  The Trustee may resign at any time by
giving five (5) days' written notice to the Company.  Such notice may be waived
by written consent of the Company.  Upon such resignation, the Trustee shall
within a reasonable time render to the Committee and to each Signatory Company
in a manner consistent with Section 13.6 of this Article a written account of
its administration of the Trust for the period following that which was covered
by the last annual accounting, through the effective date of resignation.

         13.9    Removal of Trustee.  The Company may remove any Trustee at any
time by giving five (5) days' written notice.  Such notice may be waived by
written consent of the Trustee being removed.  In 





                                     -96-

<PAGE>   104

the event of removal, the Trustee shall be under the same duty to settle its
accounts as provided in Section 13.6 of this Article.

         13.10   Appointment of Successor Trustee.  The resignation or removal
of a Trustee shall not terminate the Trust.  In the event of a vacancy in the
position of Trustee at any time, the Company shall designate and appoint a
successor Trustee.  Any successor Trustee, upon executing an acknowledged
acceptance of the trusteeship and upon settlement of the accounts and discharge
of the retiring Trustee, shall be vested, without further act on the part of
anyone, with all the estates, titles, rights, powers, duties and discretions
granted to the retiring Trustee.  The retiring Trustee shall execute and deliver
such assignments or other instruments as may be deemed advisable by the
successor Trustee.

         13.11   Trustee's Compensation and Expenses.  The Trustee may receive
such reasonable compensation as may be agreed upon from time to time; provided,
however, that no person serving as Trustee who receives full-time compensation
from a Signatory Company or group of Signatory Companies shall receive
compensation from the Trust Fund except for reimbursement of expenses properly
and actually paid.  All brokerage costs, transfer taxes and expenses incurred
in connection with the investment and reinvestment of the Trust Fund, all
income taxes or other taxes of any kind whatsoever which may be levied or
assessed under existing or future laws upon or with respect to the Trust Fund,
and any interest which may be payable on money borrowed by the Trustee for the
purposes of the Trust, shall be paid from the Trust Fund, and, until paid,
shall 





                                     -97-

<PAGE>   105

constitute a charge upon the Trust Fund.  All other administrative expenses
incurred by the Trustee in the performance of its duties, including reasonable
fees for legal, appraisal and accounting services rendered to the Trustee, such
compensation to the Trustee as may be agreed upon in writing from time to time
between the Company and the Trustee, all premiums for bonds required under
Section 13.12 hereof and all other proper charges and disbursements of the
Trustee, shall be paid from the Trust unless paid by the Signatory Companies;
provided, however, that premiums for required bonds under Section 13.12 hereof
may not be paid from the Trust.  It is expressly provided, however, that any
excise tax assessed against any Trustee pursuant to the provisions of Section
4975 of the Code shall not, for the purposes of this Plan and Trust, be
considered an expense of the Trust to be paid by the Signatory Companies as
hereinabove provided.

         13.12   Bonds.  Unless specifically exempted by federal statute or
regulations promulgated thereunder, each and every Trustee shall be required to
give bond for the faithful performance of its duties, the amount of which shall
be fixed at the beginning of each Plan Year.  The amount of each bond shall be
determined annually by the Board of Directors of the Company but shall not be
less than ten percent (10%) of the amount of funds handled.  Unless otherwise
required by the Secretary of Labor, however, no bond shall be less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000).  For purposes of fixing the amount of the bond, the amount of funds
handled by the Trustee shall be determined by the funds handled by the Trustee
during the preceding 





                                     -98-

<PAGE>   106

Plan Year, or, if the Plan had no preceding Plan Year, the amount of funds to be
handled during the current Plan Year by the Trustee.  The bond shall provide
protection to the Plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on
the part of the Trustee, directly or through connivance with others.  However,
this Section 13.12 shall not apply as to any Trustee who is also a member of the
Committee and has given bond as required by Article XI, Section 12.11 hereof.

         13.13   Indemnity.  The Signatory Companies shall indemnify and save
the Trustee harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses
(including counsel fees approved by the Company) and liabilities (including any
amounts paid in settlement with the Company's approval) or other effects and
consequences arising from any act, omission or conduct in its official
capacity, except when the same is judicially determined to be due to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee.  Any amounts paid or owing
under this Section 13.13 shall be considered as an expense of the Trustee to be
paid as provided in Section 13.11 hereof.  It is expressly provided, however,
that any excise tax assessed against the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of
Section 4975 of the Code shall not, for the purposes of this Plan and Trust, be
considered an expense of the Trustee to be paid by the Signatory Companies as
hereinabove provided.

         13.14   Voting and Exchange Offerings with Respect to Employer Stock.

         (a)     Each Participant shall have the right, and shall be afforded
the opportunity, to direct the manner as to which the 





                                     -99-

<PAGE>   107

Employer Stock allocated to the Participant's Account shall be voted at all
stockholders' meetings or in connection with all solicitations of written
consents in lieu of meetings.  Each Participant shall be provided with timely
written notice of such meetings or consent solicitations.  A Participant's
instruction on the voting of Employer Stock shall be transmitted in writing to
the Trustee who shall vote such stock in accordance with such written
instruction, provided such instruction is received by the Trustee within a
reasonable time prior to the time such Employer Stock must be voted.  A
Participant shall be permitted to revoke or change any such instruction,
provided such revocation or change is received in writing by the Trustee within
a reasonable time prior to the time such Employer Stock must be voted.  A
Participant's instructions to the Trustee on the voting of Employer Stock shall
remain in the strict confidence of the Trustee.  In the absence of a written
instruction from a Participant, the Trustee shall not vote the shares of
Employer Stock allocated to such Participant's account.  The Trustee shall vote
all unallocated shares in the same proportion as allocated shares are voted by
Participants.

         (b)(i)  Each Participant, with respect to Employer Stock allocated or
attributable to his Account, shall have the right and shall be afforded the
opportunity to direct the Trustee as to the manner in which to respond to any
tender or exchange offer, or any matter relating to such an offer, in regard to
shares of Employer Stock (an "Offer").

             (ii)         The Trustee shall as soon as practicable distribute
         or cause to be distributed to each Participant such information
         relating to any Offer the Trustee receives as a stockholder of record
         of the Company.

            (iii)         All directions by a Participant shall be given to the
         Trustee in writing and in such form and manner as the Committee shall
         prescribe.  A Participant shall be permitted to revoke or change any
         directions given, provided such revocation or change is received in
         such form and manner as prescribed herein for giving direction
         regarding an Offer.  Any such directions shall remain in the strict
         confidence of the Trustee.

             (iv)         Direction may be given to the Trustee to take such
         actions as may be necessary to:  i) to accept the Offer with respect
         to the Employer Stock as to which a Participant has the right to give
         such direction, or (ii) to reject the Offer with respect to the
         Employer Stock as to which a Participant has the right to give such
         direction.

              (v)         To the extent the Trustee has duly received direction
         from a Participant, the Trustee shall comply therewith.

             (vi)         To the extent direction has not been duly received
         from a Participant, it shall be deemed that each such Participant has
         duly directed the Trustee to reject the Offer (with respect to the
         Employer Stock as to which such Participant has the right to give such
         direction).  The Trustee shall respond to the Offer with respect to
         any unallocated Employer Stock in the same proportion as participants
         accept or reject the Offer with respect to allocated Employer Stock.

            (vii)         The Trustee shall accept or reject such Offer with
         respect to Employer Stock in accordance with the foregoing on the last
         day permitted pursuant to such Offer for such action to be taken
         without the loss of any benefit under the Offer.  To be considered
         duly received by the Trustee, all directions must be received by the
         Trustee within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the
         Trustee, prior to such last day so that the Trustee may act in
         accordance with such written directions.

                 (e)      To invest and reinvest the Trust assets, or any part

                 (h)      To institute, join in, maintain, defend, compromise,
         submit to arbitration or settle any litigation, claim, obligation or

         the Trustee and without the joinder of any Participant; and

                 (i)      From time to time transfer to a common or pooled

         the terms and provisions of the common or pooled trust fund which
         contemplate the commingling for investment purposes of such trust
         assets with trust assets of other employees' profit sharing and pension

         or pooled trust fund all or such part of the Trust Fund as the Trustee
         may deem advisable; and

                 (j)      To partition any property or interest held as part of
         the Trust Fund and to pay or receive such money or property necessary
         or advisable to equalize differences; to make any distribution from

         Fund, which valuation at all times shall be binding upon the Signatory
         Company and all Participants; and

                 (k)      To loan or borrow money in any manner (including
         joint and several obligations) with or without security, upon such
         terms as the Trustee may deem advisable regardless of the duration of

         making of purchase money mortgages), pledge or in any other manner
         encumber all or any part of the Trust Fund as the 





                                     -104-

<PAGE>   112

         Trustee may deem advisable.  However, this subparagraph shall not
         apply to purchases of Qualifying Employer Securities or Employer
         Stock; and

                 (l)      Subject to periodic review and approval by the
         Committee, to select, employ and reasonably compensate such lawyers,
         brokers, banks, investment counsel or other agents or employees and to
         delegate to them such of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee
         (including the power to vote shares of stock) as the Trustee deems
         advisable in administering the Trust Fund; and

                 (m)      To appoint any person or corporation in any state of
         the United States to act as ancillary Trustee with respect to any
         portion of the Trust Fund.  Any ancillary Trustee shall have such
         rights, powers, duties and discretions as are delegated to it by the
         Trustee but shall exercise the same, subject to such limitations or
         further directions of the Trustee as shall be specified in the
         instrument evidencing its appointment.  Any ancillary Trustee shall be
         accountable solely to the Trustee and shall be entitled to reasonable 
         compensation; and

                 (n)      To exercise all the rights, powers, options and
         privileges now or hereafter granted to trustees under the Texas Trust
         Code, except such as conflict with the terms of this instrument.  So
         far as possible, no subsequent legislation or regulation shall limit
         the rights, powers or privileges granted in this Plan or in the Texas
         Trust Code, as it now exists.  The Trustee shall have, hold, manage,
         control, use, invest and reinvest, disburse and dispose of the Trust
         Fund as if the Trustee were the owner thereof in fee simple instead of
         in trust, subject only to such limitations as are contained herein or
         such of the laws of the State of Texas as cannot be waived.  The
         instrument shall always be construed in favor of the validity of any
         act or omission of the Trustee; and

                 (o)      To deposit the assets of the Trust with itself or its
         successors as a bank and/or its bank holding affiliate.
         Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Trustee may cause
         all or any part of the monies or other assets of the Trust, without
         limitation as to amounts, to be commingled with the monies and assets
         of similar trusts created by others by causing such monies and assets
         to be invested as a part of any one or more of the trust funds created
         by the Trustee, and monies or other assets of this Trust so added to
         any of such trust funds at any time shall be subject to all of the
         provisions of the governing instruments of any said trust funds; and

                 (p)      To purchase life insurance contracts on the lives of
         Participants, subject to the following restrictions:

                          (1)     In the event ordinary life insurance
                 contracts are purchased on the lives of Participants, the
                 aggregate premiums for such life insurance for each
                 Participant shall be less than one-half (1/2) of the Signatory
                 Company's Employer Contributions allocated to the credit of
                 the Participant at any particular time.  Upon retirement of a
                 Participant, the Trustee shall either distribute the life
                 insurance contracts to that Participant or convert the entire
                 value of the life insurance on the Participant on or before
                 retirement so as to provide periodic income for the Retired
                 Participant;

                          (2)     In the event term life insurance contracts
                 are purchased on the lives of Participants, the Trustee shall
                 expend for premiums for each Participant no more than
                 twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate of the Signatory
                 Company's Employer Contributions allocated to the credit of
                 that Participant at any particular time; and

                          (3)     All insurance policies shall be held by the
                 Trustee, and all right, title and interest therein shall be
                 vested in the Trustee until disposed of by the Trustee as
                 herein provided.  At any time and from time to time, each
                 insured Participant shall have the unrestricted right to
                 designate the Beneficiary to receive the death proceeds of the
                 policy or policies on his life, and the Trustee as directed by
                 the Committee shall cause such Beneficiary designation to be
                 made effective.  If the Participant is married, the
                 Participant's spouse shall be the Beneficiary unless pursuant
                 to Article VI, Section 6.2 of the Plan the spouse consents to
                 the designation of another Beneficiary.

         14.4    Prohibited Transactions.  Except as elsewhere permitted in the
Act:

                 (a)      The Trustee shall not cause the Plan to engage in a
         transaction if it knows, or should know, that such transaction
         constitutes a direct or indirect:

                          (1)     Sale, exchange or leasing of any property 
                 between the Plan and a party in interest;





                                     -106-

<PAGE>   114

                          (2)     Lending of money or other extension of credit
                 between the Plan and a party in interest, except for exempt
                 and authorized transactions;

                          (3)     Furnishing of goods, services or facilities

                 a party in interest of any assets of the Plan; or

                          (5)     Acquisition on behalf of the Plan of any
                 Employer Stock or Employer Real Property in violation of
                 Section 407(a) of said Act.

                 (b)      The Trustee who has authority or discretion to
         control or manage the assets of a Plan shall not permit the Plan to
         acquire or hold any Employer Stock or Employer Real Property if it
         knows, or should know, that holding such security or real property
         violates Section 407(a) of said Act.

                 (c)      The Trustee shall not:

                          (1)     Deal with the assets of the Plan in its own 
                 interest or for its own account;

                          (2)     In his individual capacity or any other
                 capacity act in any transaction involving the Plan on behalf
                 of a party (or represent a party) whose interests are adverse
                 to the interests of the Plan or the interests of its
                 Participants or Beneficiaries; or

                          (3)     Receive any consideration for its own
                 personal account from any party dealing with the Plan in
                 connection with a transaction involving the assets of the
                 Plan.

                 (d)      A transfer of real or personal property by a party in
         interest to the Plan shall be treated as a sale or exchange if the
         property is subject to a mortgage or similar lien which the Plan
         assumes or if it is subject to a mortgage or similar lien which a
         party in interest placed on the property within the ten-year period
         ending on the date of the transfer.

                 (e)      Except as otherwise permitted in the Act:

                          (1)     The Plan shall not acquire or hold:

                                  (A)      Any Employer Stock which is not a 
                          Qualifying Employer Security, or

                                  (B)      Any Employer Real Property which is
                          not Qualifying Employer Real Property.

                 (f)      For purposes of determining the time at which a Plan
         acquires Employer Real Property for purposes of this section, such
         property shall be deemed to be acquired by the Plan on the date
         on which the Plan acquires the property or on the date on which the
         lease to the Signatory Company (or Affiliated Company) is entered into,
         whichever is later.

                 (g)      The Trustee shall not acquire any collectibles.  For
         purposes for this subsection, "collectibles" means any work of art,
         any rug or antique, any metal or gem, any stamp or coin, any alcoholic
         beverage, or any other tangible personal property specified by the
         Secretary of Labor or Secretary of the Treasury.

         14.5    Investment of Contributions.  Each Participant shall have the
right to elect, in writing on a form provided by the Committee, to have the
After-Tax Employee Contributions, Deferral Contributions, Employer Matching
Contributions and Employer Contributions which are allocated to his Account
invested in such classes of investments as are selected by the Committee and
offered for Participants' investment on a uniform, nondiscriminatory basis.
Such classes of investments shall be selected from time to time by the
Committee.  The Participant may elect any combination of investments in these
Funds in minimum increments prescribed by the Committee.  In the absence of an
election by a Participant, such Participant's Account shall be invested in the
fixed income fund  or its equivalent, which is offered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 14.5.

         A Participant may change the investment of his present Account and the
investment of future contributions to be made on his behalf by giving written
notice to the Committee (on the prescribed form).  Only one change may be made
each Plan quarter except to the extent 





                                     -108-

<PAGE>   116

otherwise determined by the Committee.  Investment election changes must be in
the minimum increments prescribed by the Committee and shall be effective on the
Entry Date coincident with or next following thirty (30) days after the election
change is received by the Committee.

         The investment of Trust Funds in Qualifying Employer Securities shall
not exceed either (a) on an aggregate basis, for the Plan and Trust as a whole,
the Trust Funds attributable to the Participant Accounts relating to Employer
Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions, or (b) on an individual
Participant Account basis (the Qualifying Employer Securities attributable to
each Participant's Account) shall not exceed the amounts allocated to each such
Participant's Account attributable to Employer Contributions and Employer
Matching Contributions.  The preceding sentence shall be applied in a manner
that is intended to comply with the applicable rulings and releases of the
Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the exemption from
registration for Qualifying Employer Securities held by the Plan and Trust.

         16.1    Amendment - General.  The Company shall have the sole right to
amend this Plan.  In the event of any such amendment, each other Signatory

                                     -109-

<PAGE>   117

amendment unless it notifies the Company, in writing, that it refuses to ratify
the amendment.  In the event that a Signatory Company refuses to ratify to any
such amendment, such refusal to ratify shall constitute a withdrawal from this
Plan by such Signatory Company.  Upon the delivery by the Company to the Trustee
of a certified copy of the resolution authorizing an amendment to this Plan,
this Plan shall be deemed to have been so amended and all Participants and other
persons claiming any interest hereunder shall be bound thereby; provided, that
no amendment:

                 (a)      Shall have the effect of vesting in any Signatory
         Company any interest in any property held subject to the terms of the
         Trust; or

                 (b)      Shall (except as permitted by law) cause or permit
         any property held subject to the terms of the Trust to be diverted to
         purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the present or future
         Participants and Beneficiaries; or

                 (c)      Shall substantially increase the duties or
         liabilities of the Trustee without its written consent; or

                 (d)      Shall (except as permitted by law) reduce benefits of
         a Participant.

For purposes of this paragraph, a plan amendment which has the effect of (1)
eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type
subsidy, or (2) eliminating an optional form of benefit, with respect to
benefits attributable to service before the amendment, shall be treated as
reducing benefits.  In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding
sentence shall apply only with respect to a Participant who satisfies (either
before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy.  In
general, a retirement-type subsidy is a subsidy that continues after
retirement, but does not include a qualified disability 





                                     -110-

<PAGE>   118

benefit, a medical benefit, a social security supplement, a death benefit
(including life insurance), or a plant shutdown benefit (that does not continue
after retirement age).  Furthermore, no amendment to the plan shall have the
effect of decreasing a Participant's vested Account balance determined without
regard to such amendment as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted
or becomes effective.

         16.2    Amendments Necessary to Comply with Intentions of Signatory
Companies.  It is the intention of each Signatory Company that its Employer
Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions to this Plan be deductible
under the applicable provisions of the Code, that such Employer Matching
Contributions and Employer Contributions not be subject to withholding under
the Code or the Federal Insurance Contributions Act; and that such Employer
Matching Contributions and Employer Contributions not be subject to the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, as part of the "regular rate".  The
Company shall make such amendments to this Plan as may be necessary to carry out
these intentions.  All amendments to this Plan which may be required for the
purpose of realizing the intentions above stated may be made retroactively.

         16.3    Termination with Respect to Signatory Company Without
Establishment of a Successor Plan.  A termination of this Plan by any Signatory
Company, as provided below in this Section 16.3, without establishment of a
successor plan, shall constitute a termination only with respect to such
Signatory Company and such termination shall not constitute a termination of
this Plan with respect to any other Signatory Company.  This Plan shall
terminate 





                                     -111-

<PAGE>   119

as to a Signatory Company upon the happening of any of the following events:

                 (a)      The approval of the Committee of a written request by
         such Signatory Company to terminate the Plan, effective as of the last
         day of the Plan Year in which such consent is issued; or

                 (b)      Twenty-one (21) years following the death of the last
         surviving original Participant living at the time this Plan was
         adopted by the Signatory Company; provided, however, that this Section
         16.3(c) shall be effective only in the event that the Rule Against
         Perpetuities is applicable to the Trust established under this Plan.

Upon termination of this Plan by any Signatory Company without establishment of
a successor plan, the Committee and the Trust will continue until the Plan
benefit of each Participant has been distributed.  Plan benefits shall be
computed and, if necessary, the Trust Fund shall be partially or totally
converted to a liquid posture to permit an efficient and equitable distribution.
The Signatory Company will give written notice to the District Director of the
Internal Revenue Service of the fact that the Signatory Company has terminated
or partially terminated the Plan.

         Distributions made on account of Plan termination shall be in
accordance with the provisions of Article IX of the Plan and in compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Code or other statutory or regulatory
agency.

         16.4    Continuation of Plan and Trust by Successor.  This Trust shall
not be considered terminated upon the dissolution or liquidation of a Signatory
Company in the event that a successor to the Signatory Company, by operation of
law or by the acquisition of its business interests, shall elect to continue
this Plan and Trust as provided in Article XVII.

                                 ARTICLE XVII.

                        Continuance of Plan by Successor

         17.1    Adoption of Plan by Successor.  In the event of the
consolidation or merger of any Signatory Company or the sale by any Signatory
Company of its assets, the resulting successor person or persons corporation
may continue the Plan by direction from such person, (if not a corporation); or
(if a corporation) by adopting the same by resolution of its board of directors
and by executing a proper supplemental trust agreement with the Trustee.  If,
within ninety (90) days from the effective date of such consolidation, merger
or sale of assets, such successor neither adopts this Plan as provided herein
nor adopts a successor plan for the benefit of the employees of the Signatory
Company, then the Plan automatically shall be terminated and the Trust Fund
shall be distributed exclusively to the Participants or their Beneficiaries in
the manner provided in Article XVI, Section 16.3.

                                 ARTICLE XVIII.

                   Merger of Plan or Transfer of Plan Assets

         18.1    Transfer, Consolidation or Merger with Another Plan.  In the
event of (1) a merger or consolidation of the Plan with any other plan or (2) a
transfer of assets and liabilities of the Plan to any other plan, each
Participant of the Plan will (if the Plan then terminated) be entitled to
receive a benefit immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer
which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to
receive immediately before such merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan
had then been terminated).

                                  ARTICLE XIX.

                    Adoption of Plan by a Signatory Company

         19.1    Method of Adoption.  Any Affiliated Company may with the
approval of the Company, adopt this Plan for its Employees.  Such adoption
shall be effectuated by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Affiliated
Company, with a copy of the approved executed resolutions to the Company and
the Committee.

         19.2    Withdrawal from the Plan.  Subject to the consent of the
Company, any Signatory Company may at any time withdraw from or discontinue its
participation in this Plan either by failure to consent to an amendment as
provided in Article XVI, Section 16.1 or by giving written notice of such
withdrawal to the Trustee and may cause to be segregated from the Trust Fund
that part of the assets held in the Trust Fund for the Accounts of the
Participants employed by such Signatory Company at the date of such
discontinuance.  A withdrawal, whether or not voluntary, from this Plan by a
Signatory Company shall not of itself constitute a termination of the Plan with
respect to such Signatory Company.  A Signatory Company which withdraws,
voluntarily or involuntarily, from this Plan may, as soon as may be practicable,
adopt a comparable employee benefit plan and trust which shall qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code.  The withdrawing Signatory Company shall then file
with the Trustee a written instrument evidencing its discontinuance in this Plan
and shall likewise file with the Trustee a certification by the Committee
authorizing the segregation from the Trust Fund of the assets attributable to
the Participants employed by such Signatory Company.  In the event of





                                     -114-

<PAGE>   122

segregation as hereinabove provided, the Trustee shall deliver to the successor
Trustee such part of the Trust Fund as may be determined by the Committee to
constitute the appropriate share of the Trust Fund then held with respect to the
Participants employed by such Signatory Company.  Such former Signatory Company
will thereafter exercise with respect to such Plan and Trust all of the rights
and powers which may be reserved to such Signatory Company under the terms of
the written instruments providing for such segregation as aforesaid. Such
segregating Signatory Company shall likewise file with the successor Trustee
such other written instruments as may be necessary in order to make effective
the continuance as a separate trust (as though such Signatory Company were the
sole creator thereof) of the assets so segregated in accordance with the
provisions of this Plan or in accordance with such other plan as may be mutually
agreed upon between such Signatory Company and a successor Trustee.

                                  ARTICLE XX.

                       Recovery of Employer Contributions

         20.1    Initial Approval By Internal Revenue Service.  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan and Trust, it is specifically understood that
this Plan and Trust is adopted and executed by the Signatory Company upon the
condition precedent that the Plan and Trust shall be approved and qualified by
the Internal Revenue Service as meeting the requirements of the Code and the
regulations and rulings issued thereunder so that the Signatory Company will be
permitted to deduct for federal income tax purposes the amount of the Deferral
Contributions, Employer Contributions 





                                     -115-

<PAGE>   123

(if any) and its Employer Matching Contributions (if any) to the Trust under the
Plan, that such Deferral Contributions, Employer Contributions (if any) and
Employer Matching Contributions (if any) will not be taxable to the Participants
as income when made and that the Trust will be exempt from federal income tax. 
In the event the Internal Revenue Service shall rule that the Plan and Trust are
not so approved and qualified, all Contributions made to the Trust under the
Plan by a Signatory Company prior to the initial determination by the Internal
Revenue  Service as to the qualification of the Plan and Trust shall revert and
be repaid by the Trustee to the Signatory Company.  No Participant, Eligible
Employee, Employee or other person shall have any right to the Employer Matching
Contributions (if any) or Employer Contributions (if any).  However, After-Tax
Employee Contributions and Deferral Contributions allocated to each
Participant's Account shall be paid to such Participant.  If the Company shall
determine, however, in consultation with the Commissioner's representatives,
that such failure of qualification may be cured by steps that the Company deems
will be in the interest of it and its Employees, the Company may elect to amend
the Plan and Trust in order to achieve such qualification rather than cause the
reversion of the Contributions as herein provided.

         20.2    Conditioned on Deductibility.  All employer contributions of
any kind under this Plan are hereby expressly made conditional on being allowed
as a deduction to the Signatory Company for federal income tax purposes.

                                  ARTICLE XXI.

                                 Miscellaneous

         21.1    Plan is a Voluntary Undertaking by the Signatory Company.  The
adoption and maintenance of this Plan and Trust are strictly voluntary
undertakings on the part of the Signatory  Company and shall not be deemed to
be a contract between the Signatory Company and any Employee.  Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to give any Employee the right to be retained
in the employment of the Signatory Company, to interfere with the rights of the
Signatory Company to discharge any Employee at any time or to interfere with an
Employee's right to terminate his employment at any time.

         21.2    Benefit Provided Solely by the Trust Fund.  All benefits
payable under this Plan shall be paid or provided for solely from the Trust and
the Signatory Company assumes no liability or responsibility therefor.

         21.3    Nonalienation.  No benefit payable or to become payable under
the Plan will, except as otherwise specifically provided by law, be subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance or charge, and any attempt so to anticipate, alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same by a Participant or
Beneficiary prior to distribution as herein provided shall be absolutely and
wholly void, whether such conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge or
encumbrance be intended to take place or become effective before or after the
expiration of the period herein fixed for the continuance of the said Trust
estate; nor will any benefit be in any manner liable for or subject to the
debts, contracts, 





                                     -117-

<PAGE>   125

liabilities, engagements or torts of the person entitled thereto.  The Trustee
shall never under any circumstances be required to recognize any conveyance,
transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge by a Participant or Beneficiary
hereunder of any part of the Trust estate or any interest therein and shall
never be required to pay any money or thing of value thereon or therefor, to any
creditor of a Participant or Beneficiary or upon any debt created by a
Participant or Beneficiary for any cause whatsoever.  This provision shall not
apply to a "qualified domestic relations order" defined in Section 414(p) of the
Code, and those other domestic relations orders permitted to be so treated by
the Committee under the provisions of the Retirement Equity Act of 1984. The
Committee shall establish a written procedure to determine the qualified status
of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such
qualified orders.  Further, to the extent provided under a "qualified domestic
relations order," a former spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the 
spouse of a surviving spouse for all purposes under the Plan.

         21.4    Applicable Law.  The provisions of this Plan shall be
construed, administered and enforced according to the Code, as amended, the
Act, and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the State of Texas.  All
contributions to and distributions from the Trust shall be deemed to take place
in the State of Texas.  The Trustee or Signatory Company may at any time
initiate any legal action or proceeding for the settlement of the accounts of
the Trustee, for the determination of any questions (including questions of
construction which may arise) or for instruction, and the 





                                     -118-

<PAGE>   126

only necessary parties to such action or proceeding shall be the Trustee and the
Signatory Company, except that any other person or persons may be included as
parties defendant at the elections of the Trustee and the Signatory Company.

         21.5    Construction.  Unless the context clearly indicates to the
contrary, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter, and the
singular shall include the plural.  The words "hereof," "herein," hereunder"
and other similar compounds of the word "here" shall mean and refer to the
entire Plan and not to any particular provision or section.

         21.6    Reference to Code or Act Sections.  Reference to the
provisions of any particular Section of the Code or Act shall be deemed
reference to any Section of the Code or Act which may hereafter contain the
same or similar provisions.

         21.7    Binding Agreement.  This Plan shall be binding upon the
adopting Signatory Companies, the Trustee and their respective successors and
assigns, and upon the Participants, their Beneficiaries and their respective
heirs and legal representatives.

         21.8    No Joint Venture Implied.  The adoption of this Plan by any
Signatory Company shall not create a joint venture or partnership relationship
between it and any other party hereto, nor shall such action ever be construed
as having that effect.  Any rights, duties, liabilities or obligations assumed
hereunder by each participating Signatory Company or imposed upon it as a
result of the terms and provisions of this Plan, shall relate to and affect
such Signatory Company alone.

<PAGE>   127

         21.9    Copies of Plan Available.  Copies of this Plan and any and all
amendments thereto shall be made available for inspection at all reasonable
times at the principal office of the Signatory Company to all Employees, and
any Employee may obtain a copy of them upon request and the payment of a
reasonable reproduction fee.

         21.10   Titles and Headings.  The titles to and headings of paragraphs
in this Plan are for convenience and reference only and, in the event of any
conflict, the text of this Plan and Trust, rather than such titles or headings,
shall control.

         21.11   Counterparts.  This Plan and all amendments thereto may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, and said counterparts shall constitute but one and the same instrument
which may be sufficiently evidenced by any one counterpart.

         21.12   Severability.  If any provision of this Plan and Trust shall
be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall
not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but each provision shall be fully
severable and the Plan and Trust shall be construed and enforced as if said
illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.

         21.13   Agent for Service of Legal Process.  The Secretary of the
Company is hereby designated as agent of the Plan for the service of legal
process.  Such designated agent may be changed from time to time by action of
the Board of Directors of the Company in writing, and such changes shall become
effective upon notification of the U.S. Secretary of Labor.

         21.14   Withholding; Reports.  The Plan Administrator shall withhold
Federal income tax from all distributions from the Trust Fund to any Payee (or,
alternatively direct the Trustee to do so by providing the Trustee with such
information as may be required under Treasury Regulations), unless such Payee
properly elects a direct rollover of the distribution in accordance with
Section 9.8.  For purposes of this Section 21.14, Payee means the Participant
or other individual or entity entitled to a distribution under this Plan.  The
manner and amount of withholding will be determined pursuant to Section 3405 of
the Code and the regulations thereunder.  The Payee shall be timely provided
with the following:  notice of the Payee's right to elect a direct rollover to
any distribution; notice of the method of making such election; and a statement
to advise the Payee that penalties may be incurred under the estimated tax
payment rules if the payments of the estimated tax are not adequate or if
sufficient tax is not withheld from the distribution.  Procedures with respect
to such notice requirements and the Payee's election shall be determined
pursuant to Section 3405 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.  The Plan
Administrator shall maintain records, and make returns and reports with respect
to distributions and withholding thereof, if any, as required under Section
6047(e) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.  In addition the Plan
Administrator shall make any reports required under Sections 402(f) and 6652(j)
pertaining to explanations to recipients of lump sum distributions from the
Plan.

         21.15   Single Plan.  The Plan shall be administered, accounted for
and otherwise treated as a single plan with respect to all the Signatory
Companies that adopt this Plan.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Twentieth Amendment
and Restatement to be executed on the date set forth below, effective as set
forth above.

effective date of the Twentieth Amendment and Restatement (the "Plan and
Trust") being July 1, 1989.  Article XVI, Section 16.1 of the Plan and Trust
permits the Company to amend the Plan and Trust.  Effective as if the
amendments made below were originally included in the Twentieth Amendment and
Restatement, the Plan and Trust is hereby amended as follows:

                 1.       Section 1.3 is amended by adding at the end thereof
         the following new paragraph:

                          For the purpose of determining the Actual
                 Contribution Percentage of a Highly Compensated Eligible
                 Employee who is either a 5% owner or one of the ten (10)
                 Highly Compensated Eligible Employees paid the greatest amount
                 of compensation (as defined under Code Section 415) during the
                 Plan Year, and is thereby subject to the family aggregation
                 rules of Code Section
<PAGE>   2
                 414(q)(6), the Actual  Contribution Percentage for the
                 family group (which is treated as one Highly Compensated
                 Eligible Employee) is the Actual Contribution Percentage
                 determined by combining the contributions and compensation of
                 all eligible Family Members.  Except to the extent taken into
                 account in the preceding sentence, the contributions and
                 compensation of all Family Members are disregarded in
                 determining the Actual Contribution Percentages for the groups
                 of Highly Compensated Eligible Employees and Non-Highly
                 Eligible Compensated Employees.


                 2.       Section 1.15 is amended by deleting the second to
         last sentence therein and adding the following paragraph at the end
         thereof:

                          In addition to other applicable limitations set forth
                 in the Plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the
                 Plan to the contrary, for Plan Years beginning on or after
                 January 1, 1994, the annual compensation of each employee
                 taken into account under the Plan shall not exceed the OBRA
                 '93 annual compensation limit.  The OBRA '93 annual
                 compensation limit is $150,000, as adjusted by the
                 Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance
                 with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
                 cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year
                 applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which
                 compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in
                 such calendar year.  If a determination period consists of
                 fewer than 12 months, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit
                 will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
                 the number of months in the determination period, and the
                 denominator of which is 12.

                          For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1994,
                 any reference in this Plan to the limitations under Section
                 401(a)(17) of the Code shall mean the OBRA '93 annual
                 compensation limit set forth in this provision.

                          If compensation for any prior determination period is
                 taken into account in determining an employee's benefits
                 accruing in the current Plan Year, the compensation for that
                 prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual
                 compensation limit in effect for that prior determination
                 period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning
                 before the first day of the first Plan Year beginning on or
                 after January 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit
                 is $150,000.

                 3.       Section 1.47 is amended by inserting after the term "
         'Trustee' means" the following:

                          Merrill Lynch Trust Company of Texas.

                 4.       Section 3.5 is amended by inserting at the end
         thereof the following paragraph:

                          The amount of Excess Contribution to be
                 recharacterized under Section 3.5(2) above or distributed
                 under 3.5(1) above with respect to a Highly Compensated
                 Eligible Employee for a Plan Year, shall be reduced by any
                 Excess Deferral Contribution previously distributed to such
                 Employee under Section 3.7 below for the taxable year ending
                 with or within the Plan Year.

                 5.       Section 3.6 is amended -

                 a)       by adding after the end of the first sentence therein
                 the following new paragraph, with the second sentence therein
                 to thereafter begin as a new paragraph:

                                  For this purpose, an eligible employee is any
                          employee who is directly or indirectly eligible to
                          receive an allocation of matching contributions or to
                          make employee contributions and includes:  an
                          employee who would be a plan participant but for the
                          failure to make required contributions; an employee
                          whose right to make employee con-tributions or to
                          receive matching contributions has been suspended
                          because of an election (other than certain one-time
                          elections) not to participate; and an employee who
                          cannot make an employee contribution or receive a
                          matching contribution because section 415(c)(1) or
                          section 415(e) prevents the employee from receiving
                          additional annual additions.  In the case of an
                          eligible employee who makes no employee contributions
                          and who receives no matching contributions, the
                          contribution ratio that is to be included in
                          determining the Actual Contribution Percentage is
                          zero.  For a plan year, contributions will be taken
                          into account as follows:  An employee contribution is
                          to be taken into account if it is paid to the trust
                          during the plan year or paid to an agent of the plan
                          and transmitted to the trust within a reasonable
                          period after the end of the plan year.  An excess
                          contribution to a cash or deferred arrangement that
                          is recharacterized (but only if such
                          recharacterization is properly provided for under
                          Section 3.3(2) above) is to be taken into account in
                          the plan year in which the contribution would have
                          been received in cash by the employee had the

                          employee not elected to defer the amounts.  A
                          matching contribution taken into account for a plan
                          year only if it is (1) made on account of the
                          employee's elective or employee contributions for the
                          plan year, (2) allocated to the employee's account as
                          of a date within that year, and (3) paid to the trust
                          by the end of the 12th month following the close of
                          that year.  Qualified matching contributions which
                          are used to meet the requirements of Code Section
                          401(k)(3)(A) are not to be taken into account for
                          purposes of the ACP test of Code Section 401(m).  For
                          purposes of determining whether a plan satisfies the
                          actual contribution percentage test of Code Section
                          401(m), all employee and matching contributions that
                          are made under two or more plans that are aggregated
                          for purposes of Code Section 401(a)(4) and 410(b)
                          (other than section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)) are to be
                          treated as made under a single plan and that if two
                          or more plans are permissively aggregated for
                          purposes of Code Section 401(m), the aggregated plans
                          must also satisfy Code Section 401(a)(4) and 410(b)
                          as though they were a single plan.

                 b)       by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph:

                                  The distribution (or forfeiture, if
                          applicable) of excess aggregate contributions will
                          include the income allocable thereto.  The income
                          allocable to the excess aggregate contributions
                          includes income for the plan year for which the
                          excess aggregate contributions were made and may
                          include income for the period between the end of the
                          plan year and the date of distribution (or
                          forfeiture).  The manner in which income allocable to
                          excess aggregate contributions is to be calculated
                          shall be made in accordance with Treas.  Reg. Section
                          1.401(m)-1(e)(3)(ii).

                 and,

                 c)       by deleting the last paragraph therein and
                 substituting therefor the following paragraph:

                                  Restriction on Multiple Use of Alternative
                          Limit.  In addition to the limits prescribed by this
                          Section 3.3 and Section 3.8 of this Article III, in
                          the event the limits in those sections have been both
                          satisfied under the 1.25 or (a) portion limit or
                          otherwise in a manner that would violate Section
                          401(m)(9)(A) of the Code, the provisions of Section
                          1.401(m)-2 of the Treasury Regulations shall be
                          applied and complied with in order to satisfy this
                          requirement.  This may result in corrective
                          distributions to certain Highly Compensated Eligible
                          Employees.  Any corrections or other adjustments made
                          to satisfy this requirement shall be determined by
                          the Committee in accordance with the Treasury
                          Regulations.  The corrective distribution shall be
                          first made by reducing the Actual Deferral





                                      -4-
<PAGE>   5
                          Percentage and with respect to all Highly Compensated
                          Eligible Employees.

                 6.       Section 7.10 shall be amended by adding at the end
         thereof the following paragraph:

                          Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of Section
                 7.10(b), in the event of the complete termination of the Plan,
                 amounts of Accounts and benefits under this Plan due to be
                 distributed to missing Participants or Beneficiaries shall be
                 preserved and protected outside the Plan by purchase of an
                 annuity or other acceptable method including the establishment
                 of an individual retirement account or other bank or financial
                 institution interest bearing or fixed income account in the
                 name of or for the benefit of such missing Participant or
                 Beneficiary.

                 7.       Section 9.8 is amended by adding at the end thereof
         the following paragraph:

                          If a distribution is one to which Sections 401(a)(11)
                 and 417 of the Code do not apply, such distribution may
                 commence less than 30 days after the notice required under
                 Section 1.411(a)-11(c) of Treasury Regulations is given,
                 provided that:

                                  (1)      the Committee clearly informs the
                          Participant that the Participant has a right to a
                          period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice
                          to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a
                          distribution (and, if applicable, a particular
                          distribution option), and

                                  (2)      the Participant, after receiving the
                          notice, affirmatively elects a distribution.

                 8.       The Plan and Trust as amended hereby shall be
         continued.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Twenty-First Amendment
to be executed in its name and on its behalf by the proper officers thereunto
duly authorized this 9th day of August 1994.

                                  Definitions


         As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated.

         1.01 Actuarial Equivalent and Actuarially Equivalent shall mean
equality in value of the aggregate amounts of benefits to be paid a Participant
or a Beneficiary hereunder.  In computing the benefits payable to a Participant
or a Beneficiary, the mortality rate assumptions used shall be based on the

shall be 7.0% which rate shall be reviewed periodically and may be changed by
the Board of Directors.

         1.02     Basic Retirement Benefit shall mean a life annuity payable at
age 65, equal to 2% of Final Average Earnings multiplied by Credited Service.

         1.03     Beneficiary shall mean the person who, upon the death of a
Participant or a Retired Participant, is entitled to receive either of a
Participant's (i) Termination Benefit; or, (ii) Basic Retirement Benefit and
Deferred Compensation Account, if a Participant has elected to have the Basic
Retirement Benefit and Deferred Compensation Account paid either as a lump sum
or in three equal annual payments, as provided for in Article III, and dies
before all payments have been made.  A Participant may designate a Beneficiary
in a written notice delivered to the Company.  In the event no written

years, and any fractions thereof, of continuous employment with the Company of
a Participant from the most recent hire date.  Credited Service shall include

years.  The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may make an irrevocable
grant to any Officer of additional years of service which shall be used in
calculation of Credited
<PAGE>   2
Service.  The number of years which shall be utilized in calculation of
Credited Service shall never exceed thirty.

         1.10     Deferred Compensation Account shall mean the account credited

Compensation Account shall be credited:  (i) from the dates that amounts are
posted to such account through the date the Deferred Compensation Account is
distributed to a Participant or Beneficiary; and, (ii) at a gross rate equal to

         6.01     The Board of Directors shall administer the Plan but may
delegate its responsibilities, other than its rights to designate any other key
management employee as a Participant and to discontinue or amend the Plan, to a
Committee appointed by it.  The Board of Directors may overrule any decision of
the Committee.  The Committee, or in the absence of a Committee the Board of
Directors, shall be the Plan Administrator.  The Company agrees to indemnify
and to hold harmless each person serving as Plan Administrator from all
liabilities and claims arising from the performance of his duties in accordance
with the terms of the Plan, unless such liability or expense results from gross
negligence or willful act or omission, or an act or omission performed in bad
faith.  The Committee shall keep a permanent record of its meetings and
actions.

         6.02     All members of the Committee shall be appointed by and serve
at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  No compensation shall be paid to
members of the Committee.

         6.03     Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may
promulgate and adopt such rules, regulations and procedures for the transaction
of its business which it deems necessary for the proper administration of the
Plan.  The Committee shall rely upon the records of the Company, as certified
to it, with respect to factual matters relating to a Participant.  In the event
of a factual dispute, the Committee shall resolve such dispute by giving due
weight to the evidence available to it.  The Committee shall interpret the Plan
in the administration and application thereof.  All such determinations shall
be final, conclusive and binding, except to the extent that they are appealed
under the following procedure.  In the event that the claim of any person shall
be denied as to all or any part of any payment or benefit under this Plan, the
Committee shall provide to the claimant (i) the reason or reasons for the
denial; (ii) reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(iii) a description of additional material or information necessary for the
person to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary; and, (iv) an explanation of the Plan's claims
procedure.

         The claimant shall have 60 days after receipt of the above material to
appeal the claim denial by the Committee to the Board of Directors for review.
The claimant may (i) request a review upon written notice to the Board of
Directors; (ii) review pertinent documents; and, (iii) submit issues and
comments in writing.

         The Board of Directors shall render its decision not later than 60
days after receipt of a request for review by the claimant, unless special
circumstances require an extension of time, in which event a decision shall be
rendered as soon as possible, but in no event later than 120 days after such
receipt.  The Board of Directors' decision shall be written and shall include
the reasons for its decision with reference to the Plan provisions on which the
decision is based.

         6.04     A Participant who is a member of the Board of Directors shall
disqualify himself from voting on any issue which pertains to his eligibility
for any benefit under the Plan or the amount of payment or any benefit for
which he is eligible.  Every decision and action of the Board of Directors
shall be binding.

         6.05     The Committee may employ such counsel, accountants, actuaries
and agents as it shall deem advisable.  The Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the compensation and other expenses of such counsel, accountants,

Plan.

                                    Funding


         7.01     The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be an 
unsecured promise to pay.

         7.02     The Plan shall not be construed so as to provide a
Participant, Retired Participant or surviving spouse or Beneficiary any greater
rights than those of an unsecured creditor of the Company.  At no time shall a
Participant, Retired Participant or surviving spouse or Beneficiary be deemed
to have any right, title, or interest in or to any specified asset or assets of
the Company.

         7.03     To fund the benefits payable pursuant to the Plan, the
Company shall establish an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the
Participants but which shall be subject to the general claims of the Company's
creditors.  The Company shall:  (i) make contributions to the Trust during each
Plan Year to fund the Basic Retirement Benefit on an actuarially sound basis;
(ii) fund the Trust with the Employer Credits on the date the Bonus
Compensation is paid or, if deferred, is first available to be paid to the
Participants; and, (iii) fund the Trust with the Elective Deferral Credits on
the date the Bonus Compensation is first available to be paid to the
Participants.  Immediately prior to a Change in Control of the Company, the
Company shall contribute to the Trust an amount which, with the existing
amounts in the Trust, shall be sufficient to pay each Participant, Retired
Participant or surviving spouse or Beneficiary, all benefits, calculated as of
the day prior to the Change in Control of the Company, which are due to each
such person under the terms and provisions of the Plan.  If the assets of the
Trust are insufficient to make any payments required under the Plan, the
Company shall make up such deficit from its assets.  Upon termination of the
Trust, if all benefits required to be paid pursuant to the Plan have been paid,
any assets which remain shall be paid to the Company.

         7.04     Pursuant to Section 1.10 above, a Participant may request a
preferred investment of funds in his Deferred Compensation Account; provided,
however, that the Company shall have no obligation to make investments or to
segregate assets according to a Participant's request.



                                  ARTICLE VIII

                      Reservation of Rights by the Company
                   and Limitations on Rights of Participants


         8.01     Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed to provide a
Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to
interfere with the right of the Company to discharge a Participant, or any
other employee, at any time.

         8.02     The benefits provided by the Plan are granted by the Company
as a fringe benefit to the Participants and are not part of any salary
increase.  No Participant in the Plan has any option to take any current
payment or bonus in lieu of the benefits provided by the Plan.

         8.03     None of the benefits under the Plan shall be subject to the
claims of creditors of Participants, Retired Participants or surviving spouses
or Beneficiaries, and shall not be subject to attachment, garnishment, or any
other legal process.  Neither a Participant, Retired Participant or surviving
spouse or Beneficiary may assign, sell, or otherwise encumber any beneficial
interest in the Plan, nor shall any such benefits be in any manner liable for
or subject to the deeds, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any
Participant, Retired Participant or surviving spouse or Beneficiary.

         8.04     The Company shall withhold from any benefit payments due
under the Plan all federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld
therefrom as determined by the Company in its sole, good faith judgment.



                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   Amendments


         The Board of Directors reserves the right to modify or amend, in whole
or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan, including the right to
make any such modifications or amendments effective retroactively, at any time
and from time-to-time, without the consent of Participants, Retired
Participants or surviving spouses, or Beneficiaries or any person or persons
claiming through them; provided, however, that no modification or amendment
shall be made which would have the effect, in any way, of diminishing,
limiting, modifying or restricting any right or benefit, which had accrued
through the effective date of such modification or amendment, to a Participant,
Retired Participant or surviving spouse or Beneficiary.



                                   ARTICLE X

                                Discontinuation


         The Board of Directors reserves the right to discontinue the Plan at
any time, without the consent of Participants, Retired Participants or
surviving spouses, or Beneficiaries or any person or persons claiming through
them; provided, however, that discontinuation of the Plan shall not have the
effect, in any way, of diminishing, limiting, modifying or restricting any
right or benefit, which had accrued through the effective date of such
discontinuation, to a Participant, Retired Participant or surviving spouse or
Beneficiary.



                                   ARTICLE XI

                                 Miscellaneous


         11.01    Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed so as to
alter, abridge, or in any manner affect the rights and privileges of
Participants to participate in and be covered by any defined benefit, defined
contribution, savings, profit sharing, Section 401(k) of the Code, group





                                      -8-

insurance, group disability, health or medical, bonus, or similar employee
plans which the Company may now or hereafter have.

         11.02    The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the
benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns.  The term successors as
used herein shall include any corporate or business entity which shall, whether
by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company and successors of any such
corporation or other business entity.

         11.03    Any headings or subheadings in the Plan are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction of any
provisions hereof.

         11.04    This Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of Texas.

         11.05    In case any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced
as if such illegal and invalid provisions had never been inserted herein.

         11.06    Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the
Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or
sent by registered or certified mail, to the Secretary of the Company at 100

                           OFFICERS' RETIREMENT PLAN



         This agreement made this 30th day of June, 1994, by and between
National Convenience Stores Incorporated ("Company") and Bank One, Texas, N.A.
("Trustee") ("Trust Agreement").

         WHEREAS, Company has adopted the National Convenience Stores
Incorporated Officers' Retirement Plan ("Plan") which is attached hereto as
Appendix A; and,

         WHEREAS, Company has incurred or expects to incur liability under the
terms of the Plan with respect to the individuals participating therein; and,

         WHEREAS, Company wishes to establish a trust ("Trust") and to
contribute to the Trust assets that shall be held therein, subject to the
claims of Company's creditors in the event of Company's Insolvency, as herein
defined, until paid to Plan participants and their beneficiaries in such manner
and at such times as specified in the Plan; and,

         WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall
constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the Plan
as an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974;
and,

         WHEREAS, it is the intention of Company to make contributions to the
Trust to provide itself with a source of funds to assist it in meeting its
liabilities under the Plan,

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do hereby establish the Trust and agree
that the Trust shall be comprised, held and disposed of as follows:



                                   SECTION 1
                             ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST


(a)      Company hereby deposits with Trustee in trust $100.00 which shall
         become the principal of the Trust to be held, administered and
         disposed of by Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement.

(b)      The Trust hereby established shall be irrevocable.

(c)      The Trust is intended to be a grantor trust, of which Company is the
         grantor, within the meaning of subpart E, part I, subchapter J,
         chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
         amended, and shall be construed accordingly.

(d)      The principal of the Trust, and any earnings thereon shall be held
         separate and apart from other funds of Company and shall be used
         exclusively for the uses and purposes of Plan participants and general
         creditors as herein set forth.  Plan participants and their
<PAGE>   2
         beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial
         ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust.  Any rights created
         under the Plan and this Trust Agreement shall be mere unsecured
         contractual rights of Plan participants and their beneficiaries
         against Company.  Any assets held by the Trust will be subject to the
         claims of Company's general creditors under federal and state law in
         the event of Insolvency, as defined in Section 3(a) herein.

(e)      Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time, or from time to
         time, make additional deposits of cash or other property in trust with
         Trustee to augment the principal to be held, administered and disposed
         of by Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement.  Neither Trustee
         nor any Plan participant or beneficiary shall have any right to compel
         such additional deposits.



                                   SECTION 2
             PAYMENTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES


(a)      Company shall deliver to Trustee a schedule ("Payment Schedule") that
         indicates the amounts payable in respect of each Plan participant (and
         his or her beneficiaries), that provides a formula or other
         instructions acceptable to Trustee for determining the amounts so
         payable, the form in which such amount is to be paid (as provided for
         or available under the Plan), and the time of commencement for payment
         of such amounts.  Except as otherwise provided herein, Trustee shall
         make payments to the Plan participants and their beneficiaries in
         accordance with such Payment Schedule.  The Trustee shall make
         provision for the reporting and withholding of any federal, state or
         local taxes that may be required to be withheld with respect to the
         payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan and shall pay
         amounts withheld to the appropriate taxing authorities or determine
         that such amounts have been reported, withheld and paid by Company.

(b)      The entitlement of a Plan participant or his beneficiaries to benefits
         under the Plan shall be determined by Company or such party as it
         shall designate under the Plan, and any claim for such benefits shall
         be considered and reviewed under the procedures set out in the Plan.

(c)      Company may make payment of benefits directly to Plan participants or
         their beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of the Plan.
         Company shall notify Trustee of its decision to make payment of
         benefits directly prior to the time amounts are payable to
         participants or their beneficiaries.  In addition, if the principal of
         the Trust, and any earnings thereon, are not sufficient to make
         payments of benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan, Company
         shall make the balance of each such payment as it falls due.  Trustee
         shall notify Company where principal and earnings are not sufficient.

                                  SECTION 3
        TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PAYMENTS TO TRUST BENEFICIARY
                          WHEN COMPANY IS INSOLVENT


(a)      Trustee shall cease payment of benefits to Plan participants and their
         beneficiaries if the Company is Insolvent.  Company shall be
         considered "Insolvent" for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i)
         Company is unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) Company
         is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States
         Bankruptcy Code.

(b)      At all times during the continuance of this Trust, as provided in
         Section 1(d) hereof, the principal and income of the Trust shall be
         subject to claims of general creditors of Company under federal and
         state law as set forth below:

         (1)     The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of
                 Company shall have the duty to inform Trustee in writing of
                 Company's Insolvency.  If a person claiming to be a creditor
                 of Company alleges in writing to Trustee that Company has
                 become Insolvent, Trustee shall determine whether Company is
                 Insolvent and, pending such determination, Trustee shall
                 discontinue payment of benefits to Plan participants or their
                 beneficiaries.

         (2)     Unless Trustee has actual knowledge of Company's Insolvency,
                 or has received notice from Company or a person claiming to be
                 a creditor alleging that Company is Insolvent, Trustee shall
                 have no duty to inquire whether Company is Insolvent.  Trustee
                 may in all events rely on such evidence concerning Company's
                 solvency as may be furnished to Trustee and that provides
                 Trustee with a reasonable basis for making a determination
                 concerning Company's solvency.

         (3)     If at any time Trustee has determined that Company is
                 Insolvent, Trustee shall discontinue payments to Plan
                 participants or their beneficiaries and shall hold the assets
                 of the Trust for the benefit of Company's general creditors.
                 Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish any
                 rights of Plan participants or their beneficiaries to pursue
                 their rights as general creditors of Company with respect to
                 benefits due under the Plan or otherwise.

         (4)     Trustee shall resume the payment of benefits to Plan
                 participants or their beneficiaries in accordance with Section
                 2 of this Trust Agreement only after Trustee has determined
                 that Company is not Insolvent (or is no longer Insolvent).

(c)      Provided that there are sufficient assets, if Trustee discontinues the
         payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof and
         subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such
         discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due
         to Plan participants or their beneficiaries under the terms of the
         Plan for the period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate amount
         of any payments made to Plan participants or their beneficiaries by
         Company in lieu of the payments provided for hereunder during any such
         period of discontinuance.

Except as provided in Section 3 hereof, after Trust has become irrevocable,

to divert to others any of the Trust assets before all payments of benefits
have been made to Plan participants and their beneficiaries pursuant to the

(a)      In no event may Trustee invest in securities (including stock or
         rights to acquire stock) or obligations issued by Company, other than
         a de minimis amount held in common investment vehicles in which
         Trustee invests.  All rights associated with assets of the Trust shall
         be exercised by Trustee or the person designated by Trustee, and shall
         in no event be exercisable by or rest with Plan participants.

(b)      The Trustee shall have the power to invest and reinvest the Trust in
         accordance with the "Investment Guidelines" attached hereto as
         Appendix B, as directed by the Board of Directors of the Company or by

disbursements, and all other transactions required to be made, including such
specific records as shall be agreed upon in writing between Company and
Trustee.  Within sixty (60) days following the close of each calendar year and
within sixty (60) days after the removal or resignation of Trustee, Trustee
shall deliver to Company a written account of its administration of the Trust
during such year or during the period from the close of the last preceding year
to the date of such removal or resignation, setting forth all investments,
receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by it, including a
description of all securities and investments purchased and sold with the cost
or net proceeds of such purchases or sales (accrued interest paid or receivable
being shown

(a)      Trustee shall act with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under
         the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in like
         capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an
         enterprise of a like character and with like aims, provided, however,
         that Trustee shall incur no liability to any person for any action
         taken pursuant to a direction, request or approval given by Company
         which is contemplated by, and in conformity with, the terms of the
         Plan or this Trust and is given in writing by Company.  In the event
         of a dispute between Company and a party, Trustee may apply to a court
         of competent jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.

(b)      If Trustee undertakes or defends any litigation arising in connection
         with this Trust, Company agrees to indemnify Trustee against Trustee's
         costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation,
         attorneys' fees and expenses) relating thereto and to be primarily
         liable for such payments.  If Company does not pay such costs,
         expenses and liabilities in a reasonably timely manner, Trustee may
         obtain payment from the Trust.

         Company generally) with respect to any of its duties or obligations
         hereunder.

         trustees by applicable law, unless expressly provided otherwise
         herein, provided, however, that if an insurance policy is held as an
         asset of the Trust, Trustee shall have no power to name a beneficiary
         of the policy other than the Trust, to assign the policy (as distinct
         from conversion of the policy to a different form) other than to a
         successor Trustee, or to loan to any person the proceeds of any
         borrowing against such policy.

(f)      However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8(e) above, Trustee
         may loan to Company the proceeds of any borrowing against an insurance
         policy held as an asset of the Trust.

(g)      Notwithstanding any powers granted to Trustee pursuant to this Trust
         Agreement or to applicable law, Trustee shall not have any power that
         could give this Trust the objective of carrying on a business and
         dividing the gains therefrom, within the meaning of section 301.7701-2
         of the Procedure and Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant
         to the Internal Revenue Code.

                                 The Committee


         5.01    The Board of Directors shall administer the Plan but may
delegate its responsibilities, other than its right to discontinue or amend the
Plan, to a Committee appointed by it.  The Board of Directors may overrule any
decision of the Committee.  The Committee, or in the absence of a Committee the
Board of Directors, shall be the Plan Administrator.  The Company agrees to
indemnify and to hold harmless each person serving as Plan Administrator from
all liabilities and claims arising from the performance of his duties in
accordance with the terms of the Plan, unless such liability or expense results
from gross negligence or willful act or omission, or an act or omission
performed in bad faith.  The Committee shall keep a permanent record of its
meetings and actions.

         5.02    All members of the Committee shall be appointed by and serve
at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  No compensation shall be paid to
members of the Committee.

         5.03    Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may
promulgate and adopt such rules, regulations and procedures for the transaction
of its business which it deems necessary for the proper administration of the
Plan.  The Committee shall rely upon the records of the Company, as certified
to it, with respect to factual matters relating to a Participant.  In the event
of a factual dispute, the Committee shall resolve such dispute by giving due
weight to the evidence available to it.  The Committee shall interpret the Plan
in the administration and application thereof.  All such determinations shall
be final, conclusive and binding, except to the extent that they are appealed
under the following procedure.  In the event that the claim of any person shall
be denied as to all or any part of any payment or benefit under this Plan, the
Committee shall provide to the claimant (i) the reason or reasons for the
denial; (ii) reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(iii) a description of additional material or information necessary for the
person to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary; and, (iv) an explanation of the Plan's claims
procedure.

         The claimant shall have 60 days after receipt of the above material to
appeal the claim denial by the Committee to the Board of Directors for review.
The claimant may (i) request a





                                      -3-
<PAGE>   4
review upon written notice to the Board of Directors; (ii) review pertinent
documents; and, (iii) submit issues and comments in writing.

         The Board of Directors shall render its decision not later than 60
days after receipt of a request for review by the claimant, unless special
circumstances require an extension of time, in which event a decision shall be
rendered as soon as possible, but in no event later than 120 days after such
receipt.  The Board of Directors' decision shall be written and shall include
the reasons for its decision with reference to the Plan provisions on which the
decision is based.

         5.04    A Participant shall disqualify himself from voting on any
issue which pertains to his eligibility for any benefit under the Plan or the
amount of payment or any benefit for which he is eligible.  Every decision and
action of the Board of Directors shall be binding.

         5.05    The Committee may employ such counsel, accountants, actuaries
and agents as it shall deem advisable.  The Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the compensation and other expenses of such counsel, accountants,
actuaries and agents incurred by the Committee in the administration of the
Plan.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    Funding


         6.01    The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be an unsecured
promise to pay.

         6.02    The Plan shall not be construed so as to provide a Participant
or surviving spouse any greater rights than those of an unsecured creditor of
the Company.  At no time shall a Participant or surviving spouse be deemed to
have any right, title, or interest in or to any specified asset or assets of
the Company.

         6.03    To fund the benefits payable pursuant to the Plan, the Company
shall establish an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the Participants but
which shall be subject to the general claims of the Company's creditors.  The
Company shall make contributions to the Trust during each Plan Year to fund the
Retirement Benefit on an actuarially sound basis.  Immediately prior to a
Change in Control of the Company, the Company shall contribute to the Trust an
amount which, with the existing amounts in the Trust, shall be sufficient to
pay each Participant or surviving spouse all benefits, calculated as of the day
prior to the Change in Control of the Company, which are due to each such
person under the terms and provisions of the Plan.  If the assets of the Trust
are insufficient to make any payments required under the Plan, the Company
shall make up such deficit from its assets.  Upon termination of the Trust, if
all benefits required to be paid pursuant to the Plan have been paid, any
assets which remain shall be paid to the Company.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                      Reservation of Rights by the Company
                   and Limitations on Rights of Participants


         7.01    Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed to provide a
Participant the right to be retained as a Director or to interfere with the
right of the stockholders of the Company, pursuant to the By-laws, to remove a
Director.

         7.02    The benefits provided by the Plan are granted by the Company
as a fringe benefit to the Participants.  No Participant in the Plan has any
option to take any current payment in lieu of the benefits provided by the
Plan.

         7.03    None of the benefits under the Plan shall be subject to the
claims of creditors of Participants or surviving spouses, and shall not be
subject to attachment, garnishment, or any other legal process.  Neither a
Participant nor surviving spouse may assign, sell, or otherwise encumber any
beneficial interest in the Plan, nor shall any such benefits be in any manner
liable for or subject to the deeds, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of any Participant or surviving spouse.

         7.04    The Company shall withhold from any benefit payments due under
the Plan all federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld therefrom as
determined by the Company in its sole, good faith judgment.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   Amendments


         The Board of Directors reserves the right to modify or amend, in whole
or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan, including the right to
make any such modifications or amendments effective retroactively, at any time
and from time-to-time, without the consent of Participants or surviving spouses
or any person or persons claiming through them; provided, however, that no
modification or amendment shall be made which would have the effect, in any
way, of diminishing, limiting, modifying or restricting any right or benefit,
which had accrued through the effective date of such modification or amendment,
to a Participant or surviving spouse.

                                Discontinuation


         The Board of Directors reserves the right to discontinue the Plan at
any time, without the consent of Participants or surviving spouses or any
person or persons claiming through them; provided, however, that
discontinuation of the Plan shall not have the effect, in any way, of
diminishing, limiting, modifying or restricting any right or benefit, which had
accrued through the effective date of such discontinuation, to a Participant or
surviving spouse.


                                   ARTICLE X

                                 Miscellaneous


         10.01   The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit
of the Company and its successors and assigns.  The term successors as used

merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all
of the business or assets of the Company and successors of any such corporation
or other business entity.

         10.02   Any headings or subheadings in the Plan are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction of any
provisions hereof.

         10.03   This Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Texas.

         10.04   In case any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced
as if such illegal and invalid provisions had never been inserted herein.

         10.05   Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the
Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or
sent by registered or certified mail, to the Secretary of the Company at 100

                                  TRUST UNDER
                    NATIONAL CONVENIENCE STORES INCORPORATED
                           DIRECTORS' RETIREMENT PLAN



         This agreement made this 30th day of June, 1994, by and between
National Convenience Stores Incorporated ("Company") and Bank One, Texas, N.A.
("Trustee") ("Trust Agreement").

         WHEREAS, Company has adopted the National Convenience Stores
Incorporated Directors' Retirement Plan ("Plan") which is attached hereto as
Appendix A; and,

         WHEREAS, Company has incurred or expects to incur liability under the
terms of the Plan with respect to the individuals participating therein; and,

         WHEREAS, Company wishes to establish a trust ("Trust") and to
contribute to the Trust assets that shall be held therein, subject to the
claims of Company's creditors in the event of Company's Insolvency, as herein
defined, until paid to Plan participants and their beneficiaries in such manner
and at such times as specified in the Plan; and,

         WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall
constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the Plan
as an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974;
and,

         WHEREAS, it is the intention of Company to make contributions to the
Trust to provide itself with a source of funds to assist it in meeting its
liabilities under the Plan,

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do hereby establish the Trust and agree
that the Trust shall be comprised, held and disposed of as follows:


                                   SECTION 1
                             ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST


(a)      Company hereby deposits with Trustee in trust $100.00 which shall
         become the principal of the Trust to be held, administered and
         disposed of by Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement.

(b)      The Trust hereby established shall be irrevocable.

(c)      The Trust is intended to be a grantor trust, of which Company is the
         grantor, within the meaning of subpart E, Part I, Subchapter J,
         Chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
         amended, and shall be construed accordingly.

(d)      The principal of the Trust, and any earnings thereon shall be held
         separate and apart from other funds of Company and shall be used
         exclusively for the uses and purposes of Plan participants and general
         creditors as herein set forth.  Plan participants and their
<PAGE>   2
         beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial
         ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust.  Any rights created
         under the Plan and this Trust Agreement shall be mere unsecured
         contractual rights of Plan participants and their beneficiaries
         against Company.  Any assets held by the Trust will be subject to the
         claims of Company's general creditors under federal and state law in
         the event of Insolvency, as defined in Section 3(a) herein.

(e)      Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time, or from time to
         time, make additional deposits of cash or other property in trust with
         Trustee to augment the principal to be held, administered and disposed
         of by Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement.  Neither Trustee
         nor any Plan participant or beneficiary shall have any right to compel
         such additional deposits.



                                   SECTION 2
             PAYMENTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES


(a)      Company shall deliver to Trustee a schedule ("Payment Schedule") that
         indicates the amounts payable in respect of each Plan participant (and
         his or her beneficiaries), that provides a formula or other
         instructions acceptable to Trustee for determining the amounts so
         payable, the form in which such amount is to be paid (as provided for
         or available under the Plan), and the time of commencement for payment
         of such amounts.  Except as otherwise provided herein, Trustee shall
         make payments to the Plan participants and their beneficiaries in
         accordance with such Payment Schedule.  The Trustee shall make
         provision for the reporting and withholding of any federal, state or
         local taxes that may be required to be withheld with respect to the
         payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan and shall pay
         amounts withheld to the appropriate taxing authorities or determine
         that such amounts have been reported, withheld and paid by Company.

(b)      The entitlement of a Plan participant or his beneficiaries to benefits
         under the Plan shall be determined by Company or such party as it
         shall designate under the Plan, and any claim for such benefits shall
         be considered and reviewed under the procedures set out in the Plan.

(c)      Company may make payment of benefits directly to Plan participants or
         their beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of the Plan.

                                   SECTION 3
         TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PAYMENTS TO TRUST BENEFICIARY
                           WHEN COMPANY IS INSOLVENT


(a)      Trustee shall cease payment of benefits to Plan participants and their
         beneficiaries if the Company is insolvent.  Company shall be
         considered "Insolvent" for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i)
         Company is unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) Company
         is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States
         Bankruptcy Code.

(b)      At all times during the continuance of this Trust, as provided in
         Section 1(d) hereof, the principal and income of the Trust shall be
         subject to claims of general creditors of Company under federal and
         state law as set forth below:

         (1)     The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of
                 Company shall have the duty to inform Trustee in writing of
                 Company's Insolvency.  If a person claiming to be a creditor
                 of Company alleges in writing to Trustee that Company has
                 become Insolvent, Trustee shall determine whether Company is
                 Insolvent and, pending such determination, Trustee shall
                 discontinue payment of benefits to Plan participants or their
                 beneficiaries.

         (2)     Unless Trustee has actual knowledge of Company's Insolvency,
                 or has received notice from Company or a person claiming to be
                 a creditor alleging that Company is Insolvent, Trustee shall
                 have no duty to inquire whether Company is Insolvent.  Trustee
                 may in all events rely on such evidence concerning Company's
                 solvency as may be furnished to Trustee and that provides
                 Trustee with a reasonable basis for making a determination
                 concerning Company's solvency.

         (3)     If at any time Trustee has determined that Company is
                 Insolvent, Trustee shall discontinue payments to Plan
                 participants or their beneficiaries and shall hold the assets
                 of the Trust for the benefit of Company's general creditors.
                 Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish any
                 rights of Plan participants or their beneficiaries to pursue
                 their rights as general creditors of Company with respect to
                 benefits due under the Plan or otherwise.

         (4)     Trustee shall resume the payment of benefits to Plan
                 participants or their beneficiaries in accordance with Section
                 2 of this Trust Agreement only after Trustee has determined
                 that Company is not Insolvent (or is no longer Insolvent).

(c)      Provided that there are sufficient assets, if Trustee discontinues the
         payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof and
         subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such
         discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due
         to Plan participants or their beneficiaries under the terms of the
         Plan for the period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate amount
         of any payments made to Plan participants or their beneficiaries by
         Company in lieu of the payments provided for hereunder during any such
         period of discontinuance.

to divert to others any of the Trust assets before all payments of benefits
have been made to Plan participants and their beneficiaries pursuant to the

(a)      In no event may Trustee invest in securities (including stock or
         rights to acquire stock) or obligations issued by Company, other than
         a de minimis amount held in common investment vehicles in which
         Trustee invests.  All rights associated with assets of the Trust shall
         be exercised by Trustee or the person designated by Trustee, and shall
         in no event be exercisable by or rest with Plan participants.

(b)      The Trustee shall have the power to invest and reinvest the Trust in

expenses and taxes, shall be accumulated and reinvested.

Trustee shall keep accurate and detailed records of all investments, receipts,
disbursements, and all other transactions required to be made, including such
specific records as shall be agreed upon in writing between Company and
Trustee.  Within sixty (60) days following the close of each calendar year and
within sixty (60) days after the removal or resignation of Trustee, Trustee
shall deliver to Company a written account of its administration of the Trust
during such year or during the period from the close of the last preceding year
to the date of such removal or resignation, setting forth all investments,
receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by it, including a
description of all securities and investments purchased and sold with the cost
or net proceeds of such purchases or sales (accrued interest paid or receivable
being shown

                           RESPONSIBILITY OF TRUSTEE


(a)      Trustee shall act with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under
         the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in like
         capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an
         enterprise of a like character and with like aims, provided, however,
         that Trustee shall incur no liability to any person for any action
         taken pursuant to a direction, request or approval given by Company
         which is contemplated by, and in conformity with, the terms of the
         Plan or this Trust and is given in writing by Company.  In the event
         of a dispute between Company and a party, Trustee may apply to a court
         of competent jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.

(b)      If Trustee undertakes or defends any litigation arising in connection
         with this Trust, Company agrees to indemnify Trustee against Trustee's
         costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation,
         attorneys' fees and expenses) relating thereto and to be primarily
         liable for such payments.  If Company does not pay such costs,
         expenses and liabilities in a reasonably timely manner, Trustee may
         obtain payment from the Trust.

(c)      Trustee may consult with legal counsel (who may also be counsel for
         Company generally) with respect to any of its duties or obligations
         hereunder.

         financial consultants or other professionals to assist it in

(e)      Trustee shall have, without exclusion, all powers conferred on
         trustees by applicable law, unless expressly provided otherwise
         herein, provided, however, that if an insurance policy is held as an
         asset of the Trust, Trustee shall have no power to name a beneficiary
         of the policy other than the Trust, to assign the policy (as distinct
         from conversion of the policy to a different form) other than to a
         successor Trustee, or to loan to any person the proceeds of any
         borrowing against such policy.

(f)      However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8(e) above, Trustee
         may loan to Company the proceeds of any borrowing against an insurance
         policy held as an asset of the Trust.

(g)      Notwithstanding any powers granted to Trustee pursuant to this Trust
         Agreement or to applicable law, Trustee shall not have any power that
         could give this Trust the objective of carrying on a business and
         dividing the gains therefrom, within the meaning of section 301.7701-2
         of the Procedure and Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant
         to the Internal Revenue Code.

energies to the business of the Company consistent with past practice, and
shall not, during the term of this Agreement, be engaged in any business
activity which would interfere or prevent Van Horn from carrying out his duties
under this Agreement; but this shall not be construed as preventing Van Horn

services on the part of Van Horn in the operation of the affairs of any company
in which such investments are made.

         (4)     Term.  The term of employment shall begin on July 1, 1994 and

                 not less than Four Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars
                 ($420,000.00) per year.  Any earnings over this minimum in one
                 year will not be applied to the minimum due in any subsequent
                 year.  Such salary shall be paid in periodic installments as
                 the Company and Van Horn shall agree.

         (b)     Bonus.  The Company shall provide Van Horn each year a bonus
                 opportunity which shall be based on the performance of the
                 Company.  The bonus opportunity for Van Horn shall never be

                 sharing plans, stock option agreements, or any other fringe
                 benefits offered to other employees and officers of the
                 Company.

in promotion of the business of the Company, including expenses for
entertainment, travel and other items.  The Company will reimburse Van Horn for
all such valid expenses upon the presentation by Van Horn, from time to time,
of an itemized account of said expenditures.

         (8)     Termination.

         (a)     If, during the time of this Agreement, Van Horn breaches his
                 duties as set forth in Paragraph 3 by gross or willful neglect
                 of such duties and responsibilities, the Company may, after
                 thirty (30) days' notice in writing to Van Horn, terminate
                 this Agreement for cause, and thereupon the Company shall be
                 obligated to pay Van Horn only his compensation or pro rata
                 part thereof which has accrued up to the date of termination.

         (b)     If, prior to the termination of this Agreement by its own
                 terms, Van Horn should be removed as President and Chief

                 without cause as provided in subparagraph 8(a) above, then at
                 the election of Van Horn, this Agreement shall be deemed
                 terminated as of the date thereof, and Van Horn shall

         (c)     In the event of termination under subparagraph 8(b) above, Van
                 Horn shall continue to receive compensation until the
                 expiration of the term of this Agreement, as follows:

                 (i)      The salary provided under subparagraph 5(a); and,

                 (ii)     Van Horn shall receive a bonus each year during the
                          remaining term of the Agreement each of which shall
                          be equal to the average amount of the bonuses paid to
                          Van Horn during the Company's fiscal year 1993 and
                          fiscal year 1994.

doctor for a period of not less than 180 days.

functions and duties of Executive on a full-time basis in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, which inability will continue in the opinion of such
doctor for a period of not less than 180 days.

functions and duties of Executive on a full-time basis in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, which inability will continue in the opinion of such
doctor for a period of not less than 180 days.

not, during the Term of this Agreement, be engaged in any business activity

without Cause (as defined below) and, if not specified, shall be deemed to be

(1) Represents earnings per share calculations of the reorganized company since
March 1, 1993.  Earnings per share calculations for the predecessor company are
not presented because they are not meaningful as a result of the confirmation
of the Plan of Reorganization and adoption of fresh-start reporting effective
March 1, 1993 (See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
incorporated by reference in Item 8 herein).

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15, "Earnings Per Share",
earnings per share have been calculated using a combination of the "if
converted" method and the "Treasury Stock" method due to requirements under the
Company's debt instruments that limit the purchase of treasury stock and
require remaining proceeds from the sale of stock to be applied toward the
retirement of the debt.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

        Fresh-Start Reporting - The Company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization in March 1993 as a result of the confirmation of the Company's
Revised Fourth Amended and Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan of
Reorganization"). Reference is made to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a complete description of the terms of the Plan of
Reorganization. In connection with the confirmation of the Plan of
Reorganization, effective March 1, 1993, the Company adopted "fresh-start
reporting" in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants' Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code". Accordingly, since March 1, 1993, the
Company's financial statements have been prepared as if it is a new reporting
entity.

        As a result of adopting fresh-start reporting, the financial information
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 and the four months ended June 30, 1993
is not prepared on a comparable basis to the information for the eight months
ended February 28, 1993 or the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992. However, except
as described below, the Company believes that the impact of the fresh-start
reporting adjustments, while material, is identifiable, and that combining the
four months ended June 30, 1993 with the eight months ended February 28, 1993
provides a useful basis for comparison to the current period, as well as fiscal
1992. Therefore, the following discussion assumes the periods in fiscal 1993 are
combined.

        Summary of Results of Operations - The Company reported net earnings
(loss) of $6.8 million, or $1.07 per share, $72.7 million and $(185.4) million
for the fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

        The fiscal 1994 net earnings include, (i) a $3.0 million ($1.8 million,
or $0.28 per share, on an after-tax basis) gain on sale of assets recorded in
conjunction with the April 1994 Circle K transaction and (ii) $2.0 million ($1.2
million, or $0.19 per share, on an after-tax basis) in consulting fees and other
expenses related to the program to enhance and redefine the Company's focus on
customer service and effectiveness through the installation of integrated
state-of-the-art sales and inventory management systems. The fiscal 1993 net
earnings include a $61.5 million extraordinary gain related to the forgiveness
of debt and a $6.6 million special charge for additional environmental
remediation costs (see Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). The fiscal 1992 net loss included a $168.1 million charge for
Restructuring and Other Special Charges (see Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Merchandise sales increased $5.7 million, or 1%, in fiscal 1994, as compared 
with fiscal 1993. On a same-store basis, merchandise sales increased 3% in 
fiscal 1994 as compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased Texas
Lottery commission revenues and money order sales, as well as the positive
impact on sales of value pricing promotions on such items as fountain drinks,
select premium beers and refrigerated juices.

        Merchandise gross profits decreased $5.5 million, or 3%, in fiscal 1994
as compared with fiscal 1993 while gross profit margins decreased 1.5 percentage
points. The decrease in gross profits and gross profit margins is primarily due
to the effects of certain value pricing promotions coupled with a $2.7 million
reduction, in fiscal 1994, in supplier discounts and rebates. These decreases
were partially offset by $3.1 million and $1.0 million increases in Texas
Lottery commission revenues and money order sales, respectively, combined with
the increased gross profits and gross profit margins of cigarettes in fiscal
1994 as compared to fiscal 1993.

        Merchandise sales decreased $64.0 million, or 11%, in fiscal 1993, as
compared with fiscal 1992, primarily due to a 20% decline in the average number
of operating stores caused by the completion of the strategic review of store
operations. On a same-store basis, merchandise sales increased 5% in fiscal 1993
as compared with fiscal 1992, primarily due to the introduction of the Company's
private label of cigarettes, modifications of the Company's value pricing
strategy on cigarettes and Texas Lottery commission revenues. In addition, the
fiscal 1992 merchandise sales were negatively impacted by inventory stockouts
the Company experienced during the first thirty days after its Chapter 11
filing.

        Merchandise gross profits decreased $8.4 million, or 4%, in fiscal 1993
as compared to fiscal 1992. Decreased sales from the closing of unprofitable
stores contributed $22.8 million to the decline in gross profits, but was
partially offset by higher merchandise margins which contributed $14.4 million.
Merchandise gross profit margins increased 2.6 percentage points from 33.1% in
fiscal 1992 to 35.7% in fiscal 1993. The increase in the gross profit margins
was primarily attributable to the fiscal 1992 profit margins being negatively
affected by a significant reduction in vendor rebates due to the Chapter 11
filing. Further contributing to the improvement in the gross profit margins were
increased Texas Lottery commis-

sion revenues of $5.5 million for fiscal 1993, as compared to fiscal 1992, 
and the aforementioned modifications of the Company's value pricing strategy 
on cigarettes.

        Gasoline sales decreased $4.1 million, or 1%, in fiscal 1994 as compared
with the prior year period primarily due to a 7% decrease in the average retail
selling price of gasoline during fiscal year 1994. This decrease was offset by a
6% increase in gasoline sales volumes. Volumes on a same-store sales basis
increased 9% from the same period last year as a result of the continued
emphasis and strategy to grow gasoline volume sales.
     
        Gasoline gross profits of $46.6 million were consistent with the prior
year level of $46.5 million. Gasoline gross profit margins decreased to 12.5
cents per gallon for fiscal 1994 from 13.2 cents per gallon in fiscal 1993. The
Company attributes the decrease primarily to the California market realizing
lower margins in the current fiscal year as a result of the prior year's
temporary cost advantage derived from the state's implementation of regulations
increasing the oxygen content of gasoline, combined with the competitive
pressures in the Texas markets in the current year. This decrease in margins was
partially offset by lower gasoline costs favorably affecting gasoline margins in
the first five months of fiscal 1994. 

        Gasoline sales decreased $15.6 million, or 4%, for fiscal 1993 as
compared with the same period in fiscal 1992 due primarily to a 5% decrease in
gasoline sales volumes, partially offset by a 1% increase in the average retail
selling price of gasoline. The gasoline sales volumes decrease resulted
primarily from the reduction in the average number of stores in operation.
Volumes on a same-store sales basis increased 5% from the same period in fiscal
1992 as a result of the Company's adoption of a volume growth strategy in March
1992. Also contributing to the same-store gasoline sales volumes increase were
the negative effects the inventory stockouts had on fiscal 1992 sales volumes
as a result of the Chapter 11 filing. 

        Higher gasoline gross profit margins contributed $7.2 million to the
$5.3 million increase in gasoline gross profits for fiscal 1993 as compared to
fiscal 1992, and were offset by a $1.9 million decrease from gasoline sales.
The improvement in gasoline gross profit margins was caused by several sudden
declines in the cost of gasoline in the wholesale market that were not fully
matched at the retail pricing level. Gasoline gross profit margins on a volume
basis averaged 13.2 cents per gallon for fiscal 1993 (the highest annual
average in the Company's history) as compared with 11.2 cents per gallon for
fiscal 1992.

volumes follows (amounts in millions):

        Operating Expenses - Operating expenses increased $7.4 million, or 5%,
in fiscal 1994, as compared to fiscal 1993, primarily due to an increase in
repairs and maintenance, insurance, labor and utilities expenses. Repairs and
maintenance increased $2.7 million primarily due to the resumption of normal
repairs and maintenance activities which in certain cases included repairs for
projects determined to be non-critical and therefore, postponed while the
Company was in Chapter 11 reorganization. Insurance expense increased $2.1
million as a result of changes in the terms and provisions of existing insurance
policies. Labor costs increased $1.6 million due to a more tenured work force
and additional staffing at the store level. Utilities increased $1.0 million
primarily due to rate increases for electricity, garbage and telephone services
in the Company's key Texas market areas. These increases were partially offset
by lower than anticipated property tax rates. Operating expenses as a percentage
of total sales increased to 19.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 from
18.5% for the same period of fiscal 1993 for the above-mentioned reasons. To
improve customer service, the Company added 600 full-time employees during the
first quarter of fiscal 1995, thereby increasing total employees to
approximately 5,300. Accordingly, the Company anticipates an increase in labor
costs by $1.0 million to $1.2 million for the quarter ending September 30, 1994.

        Operating expenses decreased $43.0 million, or 21%, in fiscal 1993, as
compared to fiscal 1992, primarily due to a decrease in labor, rent and other
store operating costs attributable to the completion of the store closure and
lease rejection programs that began in December 1991 with the Chapter 11 filing.
Rent expense was also reduced in fiscal 1993 due to the partial implementation
of lower renegotiated store and equipment rents. In addition, insurance expense
decreased in fiscal year 1993 as a result of the decreased store base and the
full implementation of the Company's private job related injuries program in
Texas in lieu of the state managed workers' compensation program. Depreciation
expense also decreased due to the reduced store base and the write-down of
certain assets in December 1991. Further contributing to the decline in
operating expenses were certain cost cutting measures implemented by the Company
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992 with respect to the reorganization of
the Company's Corporate Kitchen operations, which included the elimination of
the truck distribution fleet and the closing of distribution centers located in
Dallas and San Antonio, Texas. Operating expenses as a percentage of total sales
decreased from 21.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 to 18.5% for the
same period of fiscal 1993 for the above-mentioned reasons.

        General and Administrative Expenses - General and Administrative
expenses for the year ended June 30, 1994 increased $2.4 million, or 8%, from
the comparable period in fiscal 1993. This increase is primarily due to (i) the
reinstatement of employee benefits effective July 1, 1993, (ii) consulting fees
and other expenses of $2.0 million, incurred in the current year period,
associated with the program to enhance and redefine the Company's focus on
customer service and employee effectiveness and (iii) increased amortization
expenses. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $2.3 million
in certain reorganization liabilities. The Company expects to incur
approximately $1.9 million of consulting expenses in the first six months of
fiscal 1995 associated with the aforementioned program to enhance and redefine
the Company's focus.
     
        General and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 1993
decreased $6.4 million, or 17%, from the comparable period in fiscal 1992,
primarily due to a decrease in administrative labor expense attributable to
field management and corporate staff reductions and the Company's suspension of
stock allocations to employees in its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP")
effective with the Chapter 11 filing. In addition, rent expense decreased in
fiscal 1993 as the Company negotiated a new lease agreement on its corporate
office building on terms substantially more favorable to the Company.

        Restructuring and Other Special Charges - As further discussed in Note
10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded
$168.1 million of Restructuring and Other Special Charges at December 31, 1991,
related to store closings, other assets affected by the Chapter 11 filing,
insurance and environmental matters. An additional $6.6 million special charge
was recorded in February 1993 related to an increase in environmental
remediation liabilities.

        Interest Expense - Interest expense increased $5.8 million in fiscal
1994 as compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the
resumption of interest accruals and payments on all indebtedness upon emergence
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Prior to March 9, 1993 (the
"Effective Date"), the Company recorded interest





                                      18
<PAGE>   7

expense only for those pre-petition debt instruments which were fully secured,
and for all debtor-in-possession financing.

        Interest expense decreased $6.7 million in fiscal 1993, as compared to
fiscal 1992, primarily due to the suspension of interest accruals on unsecured
and undersecured pre-petition indebtedness concurrent with the December 9, 1991
Chapter 11 filing (the "Petition Date"). Subsequent to December 9, 1991, the
Company recorded interest expense only for those pre-petition debt instruments
which were fully secured, and for all debtor-in-possession financing. As of the
Effective Date the Company resumed recording interest expense as incurred. Such
interest expense was less than that recorded prior to the Chapter 11 filing due
to lower outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates resulting from the
adoption of the Plan of Reorganization.

        Interest Income - Interest income for the year ended June 30, 1994
increased $0.8 million from the prior year period. This increase was primarily
due to the increase in cash available for investment purposes in fiscal 1994 as
compared to 1993. In addition, the Company's short-term investments yielded a
higher rate of return in fiscal 1994.

        Gain on Sale of Assets - During 1994, the Company completed a
transaction whereby the Company, (i) exchanged its 53 operating convenience
stores in Southern California, together with related inventories and equipment,
for 88 operating convenience stores of The Circle K Corporation in the
Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston, Texas areas, together with related inventories
and equipment and, (ii) sold its 27 operating convenience stores in Atlanta,
Georgia, together with related inventories and equipment, for cash consideration
of $9,150,000. The Company recorded a pretax gain of $3.0 million in conjunction
with this transaction.

        Reorganization Expenses, net - Reorganization expenses include those
costs and income items which were incurred by the Company solely as a result of
operating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. During the years ended June
30, 1993 and 1992, the Company incurred $8.1 million and $3.4 million,
respectively, of such costs which were primarily for professional fees the
Company was required to pay to attorneys, accountants and investment bankers
involved in the Chapter 11 proceeding. 

     Fresh-Start Adjustments - As a result of adopting fresh-start 
reporting, the Company made adjustments to record assets and 
liabilities at their fair market values as of March 1, 1993 and to record the 
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 - "Accounting 
for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). The adjustments to record assets and
liabilities at their fair market values primarily include an increase in the
reserve for litigation costs in connection with the conclusion of the Chapter 11
reorganization offset by the elimination of a reserve as a result of the
proposed termination of the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (see Note 10
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

        Income Taxes - The effective income tax rate of the reorganized company
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 and the period from Inception (March 1,
1993) to June 30, 1993 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily because
of state income taxes and the inability to deduct for tax purposes the
amortization of Reorganization Value in Excess of Amounts Allocable to
Identifiable Assets, offset in fiscal 1994 by targeted jobs tax credits and the
cumulative increase in the net deferred tax asset resulting from an increase in
the statutory federal tax rate. The effective income tax rate of the predecessor
company for the eight months ended February 28, 1993 differs from the federal
statutory rate primarily because the previous method of accounting required the
use of prior year loss carryforwards to reduce the effective federal income tax
rate for financial reporting purposes. The effective income tax rate of the
predecessor company for fiscal 1992 differs from the federal statutory rate
primarily because the federal income tax benefit was recorded only to the extent
such benefit could be offset against deferred income taxes payable.

        Extraordinary Gain - On the Effective Date or thereafter as provided in
the Plan of Reorganization, the Company distributed cash, debt instruments,
Common Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock in settlement of its
liabilities subject to compromise. The fair market value of the cash and
securities that were distributed was approximately $61.5 million less than the
pre-petition liabilities and was recorded as an extraordinary gain on the
forgiveness of debt (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).

        Inflation - The Company believes inflation has not had a material effect
on its results of operations in recent years. However, the Company has
experienced short-term fluctuations in its gasoline gross profit margins, both
positive and negative, as a result of changing market conditions for the supply
and demand of gasoline.

        Pro Forma Results of Operations for Fiscal 1993 - Management of the
Company has made pro forma calculations of





                                      19
<PAGE>   8
year-to-date operating results based on the assumption that the Plan of
Reorganization had become effective on July 1, 1992. Such calculations resulted
in pro forma unaudited net earnings of $8.8 million, or $1.35 per share, for the
twelve months ended June 30, 1993 (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

(a) Includes $7.4 million and $6.3 million that has been reserved at the
    Company's option related to the remittance of tax and lottery collections at
    June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. June 30, 1994 also includes $6.2
    million which is currently held in escrow pending the resolution of mortgage
    related matters associated with the Circle K transaction completed April 
    29, 1994.

        Liquidity - Working capital totalled $9.3 million at June 30, 1994 and
$11.7 million at June 30, 1993. Cash and equivalents were $41.1 million and
$46.0 million at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

        Cash from operating activities totalled $25.3 million, $56.1 million and
$28.5 million for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
The decrease in fiscal year 1994 cash from operating activities versus fiscal
year 1993 is due primarily to the effect on cash flow from operating activities
of the Company being in reorganization prior to March 1, 1993, along with the
resumption of credit terms with the Company's trade vendors during fiscal year
1993. Operating earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization, reorganization items and other non-recurring items ("EBITDA")
amounted to $35,218,000, $49,374,000 and $9,202,000 during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. EBITDA is presented to provide
additional information about the Company's ability to meet its future debt
service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and should not be
construed as a substitute for earnings from operations or a better indicator of
liquidity than cash flow from operating activities.

        During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 the Company began the
implementation of a program to enhance and redefine the Company's focus on
customer service and employee effectiveness. This program is the result of an
extensive review by management and outside consultants. An integral component of
the program involves the upgrading of equipment and technology through the
installation of integrated state-of-the-art sales and inventory management
systems. These systems will significantly automate store operations by capturing
data on point-of-sale and scanning equipment. The Company will initiate the
program in its Dallas/Fort Worth stores and estimates that it will incur capital
expenditures of approximately $10.0 million in such market by mid fiscal 1995.
Additionally, the Company estimates that it will incur approximately $3.2
million in consulting expenses in conjunction with the program, $1.3 million of
which were incurred in fiscal 1994. These costs will be funded by cash generated
from operations, as well as cash on hand. As noted below, the Company's
long-term bank credit agreements were amended to allow an increase in the fiscal
year 1994 capital expenditures budget from $17.3 million to $25.0 million.

        On April 29, 1994, the Company completed the transaction whereby the
Company, (i) exchanged its 53 operating convenience stores in Southern
California, together with related inventories and equipment, for 88 operating
convenience stores of The Circle K Corporation in the Dallas/Fort Worth and
Houston, Texas areas, together with related inventories and equipment and, (ii)
sold its 27 operating convenience stores in Atlanta, Georgia, together with
related inventories and equipment, for cash consideration of $9,150,000. The
cash proceeds were used to fund transaction costs, capital expenditures and to
reduce long-term bank debt.

        As discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company established, in December 1991, restructuring liabilities
of $19.2 million for anticipated market divestitures and lease settlement
claims. The restructuring liabilities totalled $7.1 million at June 30, 1993.
The $12.1 million reduction in the restructuring liabilities

                                      20
<PAGE>   9

was due to, (i) the reclassification to Liabilities Subject to Compromise of the
$10.2 million liability for lease settlement claims and (ii) the effects of the
sale of the Company's stores in the San Francisco Bay area. Liabilities Subject
to Compromise were satisfied with cash and/or company stock in conjunction with
the Chapter 11 reorganization. In conjunction with the April 1994 Circle K
transaction involving the Georgia and remaining California operations, such
remaining liability balance was reduced to zero.

        In December 1991, the Company also recorded a special charge of $46.6
million related to an increase in insurance liabilities. The insurance
liabilities at June 30, 1992, 1993 and 1994 totalled $3.9 million, $9.8 million
and $17.5 million, respectively. During fiscal year 1993 the insurance liability
was increased for accruals of $14.4 million and decreased for cash payments of
$8.5 million. During fiscal 1994 the insurance liability was increased for
accruals of $17.1 million and decreased for cash payments of $9.4 million.

        See "Capital Resources" section below, as well as Notes 10 and 11 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
the environmental liabilities.

        The Company has historically maintained a portfolio of surplus and
excess real estate properties in anticipation of expansion. During the period of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, the Company eliminated its new store
development program and sold 9 parcels of surplus real estate for $1.5 million,
net of closing costs, and sold surplus store equipment for an additional $4.7
million. In addition, in July 1992 the Company sold its 21 operating convenience
stores, together with related inventories and equipment, located in and around
the San Francisco Bay area for $3.1 million. Net proceeds from these sales were
used to partially fund the Company's cash requirements upon emerging from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization, the Company has sold 27 additional parcels of surplus real
estate for $3.7 million, net of closing costs. Net proceeds from such sales, and
any sales in the future, are generally required to be applied against mortgage
or bank long-term debt. As of June 30, 1994, 47 parcels of surplus real estate
were held by the Company.

        Because substantially all of the Company's sales are for cash and total
inventories are converted to cash approximately once a month, the Company
considers its cash flows adequate to satisfy its daily working capital
requirements. However, in order to further enhance its liquidity, the Company
has a Revolving Credit Agreement which provides for the borrowing and/or
issuance of letters of credit in the aggregate of up to $8.0 million, increasing
to $11.0 million during the period from November 1 through May 1 of each year.
The Revolving Credit Agreement requires that, during each fiscal year, the
Company pay off all outstanding cash borrowings thereunder for a period of 30
consecutive days. The Company had no borrowings under this facility during
fiscal 1994. Letter of credit issuances cannot exceed $8.0 million and cash
borrowings are limited to the commitment limit less letters of credit
outstanding. The facility terminates on September 30, 1995. At June 30, 1994, no
letters of credit were outstanding under this facility.

        Capital Resources - The Company's debt instruments provide for repayment
generally over a 7 to 10 year period, except for the aforementioned Revolving
Credit Agreement which becomes due and payable September 30, 1995. Principal is
required to be paid quarterly and bears interest at a fixed percentage ranging
from 7.4% to 9.5%, a percentage above the prime rate of the lender or various
margins above the United States Treasury Securities rate or Eurodollar rates.
Management of the Company believes that a significant portion of the operating
cash flow will be dedicated to these payments during the next nine years.
     
        The Company's long-term bank debt agreements contain limits on the
amount of capital expenditures and environmental remediation expenses the
Company can incur. During the third quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company's
long-term bank debt agreements were amended to allow an increase in the fiscal
year 1994 capital expenditure budget from $17.3 million to $25.0 million. The
Company incurred capital expenditures of $21.9 million during fiscal 1994
compared to $11.7 million in fiscal 1993 and $3.6 million in fiscal 1992. During
1994, such expenditures were comprised primarily of $9.9 million of gasoline
dispensing equipment and installation of underground piping required to comply
with environmental laws (the "Stage II Vapor Recovery Equipment"). In addition,
the Company incurred $3.9 million on store remodels and eateries, $3.1 million
in store equipment replacement, $2.6 million upgrading security systems in the
stores, and $2.4 million on miscellaneous projects. The Company's long-term bank
debt agree-





                                      21
<PAGE>   10
ment limits fiscal 1995 capital expenditures/remediation to excess cash
flow, as defined, not to exceed $20.3 million. For fiscal 1995 the Company
anticipates it will incur capital expenditures/remediation as required by
environmental regulations, along with upgrading store security systems,
installation of state-of-the-art sales and inventory management systems, store
remodels, new store construction and equipment replacement which could total up
to $30.0 million. The Company is currently in negotiations to amend the
long-term bank debt agreements in order to facilitate such capital
expenditures/remediation noted above. The outcome of such negotiations cannot
be determined at this time. For fiscal 1996 the long-term bank debt agreements
limit capital/environmental remediation expenditures to excess cash flow, as
defined, not to exceed $24.0 million.

        Under the terms of certain of the Company's long-term bank debt
agreements, the Company cannot pay cash dividends on its Common Stock or
purchase any treasury stock.

        Below is a table illustrating primary financial ratios and coverage
tests ("Covenants") as of June 30, 1994 associated with the Company's long-term
bank debt instruments. (all amounts, excluding ratios are in thousands).

</TABLE>

        Covenants noted above are computed as defined per the Company's
long-term bank debt instrument agreements. At June 30, 1994, the Company was in
compliance with such Covenants.

        The Company's environmental remediation exposure is related primarily to
the clean up of contaminated soil caused by leaking underground gasoline storage
tanks and underground piping systems. The Company spent $1.3 million in fiscal
1994 on environmental remediation activities, compared to $1.3 million in fiscal
1993 and $1.7 million in fiscal 1992. The Company estimates that it will spend
$10.6 million on such expenditures through 1999. During the second quarter of
fiscal year 1992 the Company completed a comprehensive plan covering its
underground storage tanks in light of the expected funding shortfalls in the
various state reimbursement programs. As a result, the Company recorded an
increase to the environmental remediation liability of $16.8 million in the
second quarter of fiscal year 1992. Not included in this liability is
approximately $4.0 million of reimbursements from established state trust funds
which the Company believes to be probable of recovery. In connection with an
updated environmental remediation cost analysis, upon emerging from Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization the Company increased its liability for future
environmental remediation and tank removal costs by an additional $6.6 million
in February 1993. As of June 30, 1993, the remediation liability totalled $18.2
million, net of the aforementioned estimated $4.0 million of reimbursable costs.
At June 30, 1994, the remediation liability totalled $21.8 million; however,
this amount does not include the aforementioned estimated reimbursements. The
actual cost of remediating contaminated sites and removing tanks may be
substantially lower or higher than that reserved due to the difficulty in
estimating such costs and due to potential changes in the status of regulation
and state reimbursement programs. The Company does not believe that any such
amount below or in excess of that accrued is reasonably estimable.
     
        On March 15, 1994, the Company filed its federal income tax return for
the year ended June 30, 1993, which reflected net operating loss carryforwards
of $55.8 million plus tax credits of $7.1 million. The net operating losses
expire in varying amounts in fiscal years 2003 to 2007 and the tax credits
expire in fiscal years 2000 to 2009. These figures reflect the adjustments
required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code after an ownership change
in the Company's stock. Section 382 will also require the Company to reduce the
tax basis of its assets by approximately $40.0 million. An ownership change is
defined as occurring when, during any three year period, the Company's 5%
shareholders (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) increase their ownership
in the Company's stock by more than 50 percentage points. The Plan of
Reorganization resulted in an ownership change since substantially all of the
new stock was issued to the creditors of the Company.

        As of June 30, 1994, the net operating loss carryforward is estimated to
have been reduced to $29.5 million as a result of the application of the losses
to reduce taxable income for fiscal 1994. The Company expects the remaining net
operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes to be available to offset
future income taxes, subject to applicable limits. However, should a second
ownership change occur within two years of the first ownership change, all the
remaining pre-confirmation net operating losses, tax credits and other tax
attributes would be eliminated. The Plan of Reorganization provided for the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation dated March 9, 1993 to contain
restrictions through June 30, 1996 on the transfer of stock to the reorganized
company's 5% stockholders (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) or those
that would become 5% stockholders as a result of the purported transfer.

        Risk and Uncertainties - During the year ended June 30, 1994, the sale
of gasoline products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages comprised 42%,
14% and 13%, respectively, of total Company sales. Under the Clinton
Administration numerous proposals have recently been made that would result in
increased excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Several of
these proposals have sought substantial increases on state and federal excise
taxes, as well as additional state taxes on tobacco products in particular.
While the Company cannot predict whether the remaining tax proposals will become
law, similar previous tax increases on such products have generally had a
negative impact on the sales and results of operations of the Company.
Additionally, numerous governmental entities are considering various regulations
related to the sale of tobacco products which, if implemented, could adversely
affect the sales and results of operations of the Company.
     
        The Company's environmental remediation exposure is related primarily to
the clean up of contaminated soil caused by leaking underground gasoline storage
tanks and underground piping systems. The Company is subject to additional
regulatory matters including environmental capital commitments and environmental
remediation, as further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The actual cost of remediating contaminated sites and
removing tanks may be substantially lower or higher than the related accrued
liabilities.

        World gasoline markets have historically been subject to periods of
sudden and extreme volatility as a result of changing supply and demand
conditions for crude oil and gasoline. The Company's liquidity and gross profits
could be adversely affected in the future should such conditions occur, and such
adverse effects could be significant.

        The Clinton Administration and many members of the Congress have
proposed various legislative measures to change existing health care programs.
Due to the labor intensive nature of the convenience store business, any
legislation or regulation which increases the Company's labor costs could have a
significant adverse effect on the results of operations of the Company. As a
result of the significant amount of uncertainty surrounding any potential
changes in health care programs, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of
any of these proposals.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
National Convenience Stores Incorporated and Subsidiaries
Houston, Texas

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National
Convenience Stores Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30,
1994 and 1993 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 1994
and for the period from inception (March 1, 1993) to June 30, 1993 (Reorganized
Company) and the eight months ended February 28, 1993 and the year ended June
30, 1992 (Predecessor Company). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     
        As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, on
February 25, 1993, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of
reorganization which became effective after the close of business on March 8,
1993. Accordingly, the accompanying Reorganized Company financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting for Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," as a new entity with assets,
liabilities and a capital structure having carrying values not comparable with
prior periods.

        In our opinion, the Reorganized Company consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 1994 and for the period from
inception (March 1, 1993) to June 30, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Further, in our opinion, the Predecessor Company
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
eight months ended February 28, 1993 and the year ended June 30, 1992 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(all tabular amounts expressed in thousands, except per share data)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of National Convenience Stores Incorporated and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company") with all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior
years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

        Basis of Presentation - As more fully described in Note 9 below, on
February 25, 1993, a court order was entered confirming the Company's Revised
Fourth Amended and Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan of
Reorganization") by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
of Texas, Houston Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"). As a result, the Company
adopted the recommended "fresh-start reporting" treatment for entities emerging
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, as set forth in the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 90-7,
"Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code"
("SOP 90-7"). For accounting purposes, the inception date for the reorganized
company is deemed to be March 1, 1993. Therefore, since March 1, 1993, the
Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if it is a new
reporting entity (the reorganized company); the term "predecessor company"
relates to the Company for all periods prior to March 1, 1993. Consequently, a
vertical black line has been placed to separate post-emergence operations from
those prior to March 1, 1993. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of
Operations, Cash Flows and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) for the periods from
Inception (March 1, 1993) to June 30, 1993 and the year ended June 30, 1994 of
the reorganized company are not comparable with those for the year ended June
30, 1992 and the eight months ended February 28, 1993 of the predecessor
company.

        In connection with the adoption of SOP 90-7, the Company was also
required to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") as of March 1, 1993 (see
Note 5).

        Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Supplemental Disclosures - For
purposes of this statement, short-term investments which have an initial
maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. "Net cash
provided by operating activities" includes the following cash payments and
receipts:

</TABLE>

        Reference is made to the analysis of the reorganized company's opening
balance sheet at March 1, 1993 (see Note 9) for a complete description of the
non-cash financing activities recorded upon emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization and the resultant adoption of fresh-start reporting.

        For the year ended June 30, 1992, non-cash investing and financing
activities were composed of the exercise by certain officers and directors of
the Company of their right to exchange $5.4 million of floating interest rate
subordinated debentures for the related promissory notes held by the predecessor
company. For financial reporting purposes, the promissory notes and debentures
were considered to offset and, therefore, the exchange had no effect on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, $2,000 of the
predecessor company's 9% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were converted into
100 shares of the predecessor company's common stock and draw downs of
outstanding pre-petition irrevocable letters of credit amounting to $9.2 million
were made primarily by the Company's insurance carriers for the payment of
pre-petition insurance claims.

        Cash and Equivalents - The cash balance is comprised of cash and cash
items in stores, in transit or in banks. The reserved cash balances at June 30,
1994 and 1993 of $13.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, are composed of
cash accumulated in trust accounts at the Company's option for the payment of
payroll, sales and gasoline taxes and state lottery sales proceeds. Also
included in the reserved cash bal-





                                      29
<PAGE>   18
ance at June 30, 1994 is cash from the Circle K transaction that has been held 
in escrow pending substitution of collateral related matters, which is 
expected to be released by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 1995.

     Inventories - Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of
first-in, first-out cost or market, determined by the retail inventory method;
gasoline inventories are stated at average cost.

     Property and Equipment - In accordance with SOP 90-7, property and
equipment were restated at March 1, 1993 to approximate fair market value as of
the Effective Date (see Note 9). Subsequent additions have been recorded at
cost. Provision for depreciation and amortization is made on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms, if
shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, whereas
renewals and betterments are capitalized.

     Reorganization Value in Excess of Amounts Allocable to Identifiable
Assets-Reorganization Value in Excess of Amounts Allocable to Identifiable
Assets ("Excess Reorganization Value") is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 20 years. Amortization in amounts of $1.5 million and $0.5 million
were recorded for the year ended June 30, 1994 and the period from March 1, 1993
to June 30, 1993, respectively. In accordance with purchase accounting, any
downward revaluations of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance (see Note 5)
will result in a reassignment of a portion of Excess Reorganization Value to
Deferred Tax Assets, net.

     Income Taxes - In connection with the adoption of fresh-start reporting,
the Company adopted SFAS 109, as of March 1, 1993 (see Note 5). Under SFAS 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement
carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by using enacted tax
rates that are applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or
liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect
of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in
net earnings in the period in which the tax rate change was enacted. Income tax
expense of the predecessor company was recorded pursuant to the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" ("SFAS 96").

     Earnings Per Share - Earnings per share have been computed by dividing
the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the
period, increased by the effect of common stock equivalents from stock options
and warrants, when dilutive, into net earnings. Fully-diluted earnings per share
are not shown as the difference is either immaterial or antidilutive in all
periods presented.

     Earnings per share for the predecessor company are not presented since
such disclosure is not meaningful as a result of the confirmation of the Plan of
Reorganization.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107, "Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments",
requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Cash,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected in
the financial statements at fair value consistent with the short-term maturity
of these instruments.

     When considering the current interest rates and the terms of the
Company's long-term debt instruments, management believes the fair value of its
long-term debt to be approximately $9.0 million less than the carrying value due
primarily to the favorable interest rates related to its long-term debt.

     The annual provision for depreciation has been computed principally in
accordance with the following rates and ranges of rates applied on the
straight-line method: Buildings, 4%; Leasehold improvements, 7%-10%; Equipment
and fixtures, 11%-17%.

     On April 29, 1994, the Company completed the transaction whereby the
Company, (i) exchanged its 53 operating convenience stores in Southern
California, together with related inventories and equipment, for 88 operating
convenience stores of The Circle K Corporation in the Dallas/Fort Worth



                                      30

and Houston, Texas areas, together with related inventories and equipment and,
(ii) sold its 27 operating convenience stores in Atlanta, Georgia, together with
related inventories and equipment, for cash consideration of $9,150,000. The
Company recorded a pretax gain of $3.0 million in conjunction with this
transaction.

     On July 10, 1992, the Company consummated the sale of 21 operating
convenience stores together with related inventories and equipment located in
and around the San Francisco Bay area to The Customer Company and its affiliated
California general partnership for $3.1 million. The Bankruptcy Court approved
the sale of such properties on July 1, 1992. Pursuant to the Company's then
existing debtor-in-possession financing agreement, the proceeds were held in
escrow pending completion of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Upon
confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization, the proceeds were used to pay down
the Company's bank debt. The resultant loss was previously provided for in the
restructuring charge recorded in December 1991.

</TABLE>

     Term Loan - On March 9, 1993, the Company entered into a term loan
agreement (the "Term Loan") with NationsBank of Texas, N. A., as agent (the
"Lender") whereby all of the outstanding balances of the Company's pre-petition
credit facilities, including the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the revolving
credit facility, as well as drawn and undrawn letters of credit, were combined
into the Term Loan for a total of $70.9 million. At June 30, 1994, 85% of the
Term Loan, excluding the portion attributable to undrawn letters of credit,
bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.39%, with the remainder bearing interest, at
the Company's option, of 1% above the prime rate of the Lender, various margins
above the United States Treasury Securities rate or Eurodollar rates. The
Company is required to make scheduled quarterly principal payments in ascending
amounts with a final payment of $1.3 million on March 31, 2000. Principal
payments attributable to undrawn letters of credit will be held in an
interest-bearing cash collateral account until such time as the letters of
credit are drawn; should the letters of credit expire before being drawn, any
excess cash held in the cash collateral account will be refunded to the Company.

     The Term Loan, along with the Revolving Credit Agreement and Letter of
Credit Agreement discussed below, are secured by substantially all assets of the
Company, its subsidiaries and the subsidiaries' stock. The Term Loan contains
limitations customarily found in such agreements on the incurrence of additional
debt, the execution of sale and leaseback transactions, investments, any
consolidation or merger of the Company, treasury stock purchases and the payment
of cash dividends. The Term Loan limits capital expenditures and environmental
remediation expenses to specified amounts over de-





                                      31

fined periods during the period of the Term Loan. The Term Loan establishes
requirements as to the maintenance of certain financial ratios and coverage
tests relating to working capital, indebtedness, net worth and cash flow, which
must be satisfied quarterly. The Company is required to reduce its aggregate
borrowing capacity under the Term Loan with the net cash proceeds from the sale
of assets.

     Below is a table illustrating primary financial ratios and coverage
tests ("Covenants") as of June 30, 1994 associated with the Company's long-term
bank debt instruments.

     Revolving Credit Agreement - On March 9, 1993 the Company entered into a
revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") with the Lender, as
agent, to provide financing for general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit
Agreement replaced the Company's previous $8.0 million "debtor-in-possession"
facility. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the borrowing and/or
issuance of letters of credit in the aggregate of up to $8.0 million, increasing
to $11.0 million during the period from November 1 through May 1 of each year.
The Revolving Credit Agreement requires that, during each fiscal year, the
Company pay off all outstanding cash borrowings thereunder for a period of 30
consecutive days. The Company had no borrowings under this facility during
fiscal 1994. Letter of credit issuances cannot exceed $8.0 million and cash
borrowings are limited to the commitment limit less letters of credit
outstanding. Cash borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest
at 1% above the prime rate of the Lender. Any remaining outstanding principal
balance becomes due and payable on September 30, 1995. The Revolving Credit
Agreement contains provisions similar to the Term Loan with respect to
collateralization, reduction of outstanding loan balances with asset sales
proceeds, limitations of Company actions and the maintenance of certain
financial ratios and coverage tests.

     Letter of Credit Agreement - On March 9, 1993 the Company entered into a
Letter of Credit Agreement (the "Letter of Credit Agreement") with Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Association ("Bank of America") which
provided for the repayment of $4.2 million of pre-petition letters of credit
which were undrawn as of the Effective Date. During the fiscal year 1994, a
bankruptcy proof of claim was settled thereby reducing the then outstanding
letter of credit balance to zero. At June 30, 1994, no amounts were outstanding
under the Letter of Credit Agreement.

     Mortgage Notes on Real Estate - Mortgage notes payable bear interest at
9.5%, increasing to 11% in 2001 and 12% in 2002. The Company is required to make
quarterly principal payments on the notes payable with the unpaid balances
maturing on September 30, 2003.

     Aggregate maturities on long-term debt for the next five fiscal years
are as follows:

                    June 30,
                     1995 ......................  $12,103
                     1996 ......................   11,691
                     1997 ......................   11,667
                     1998 ......................   12,651
                     1999 ......................   13,192
                          
     Interest - Effective with the Petition Date, the Company recorded
interest expense only for those pre-petition debt instruments which were fully
secured and for all debtor-in-possession financing. As of the Effective Date,
the Company has been recording interest expense as incurred.

        In connection with the adoption of fresh-start reporting, the Company
adopted SFAS 109, as of March 1, 1993 (see Note 1). The effective income tax
rate of the reorganized company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 and the
period from Inception (March 1, 1993) to June 30, 1993 differs from the federal
statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes and the inability to
deduct for tax purposes the amortization of Excess Reorganization Value, offset
in fiscal 1994 by targeted jobs tax credits and the cumulative increase in the
net deferred tax asset resulting from an increase in the statutory federal tax
rate. Income tax expense for the predecessor company was recorded pursuant to
the provisions of SFAS 96. SFAS 96 uses an asset and liability approach similar
to SFAS 109. However, under SFAS 96, consideration of future events, other than
the reversal of temporary differences, is not permitted. For the eight months
ended February 28, 1993, the predecessor company incurred a federal net
operating loss and therefore, income tax expense was comprised solely of state
income taxes. In fiscal 1992 the tax benefit of the net operating losses was
recorded only to the extent the benefit could be offset against existing
deferred income taxes payable.

        Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax asset as of
June 30, 1994 and 1993, were as follows:

        The deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $3.5 million
during fiscal 1994 and by $5.6 million during the period from Inception (March
1, 1993) to June 30, 1993. The decrease in the valuation allowance was recorded
as a reduction of the Excess Reorganization Value. The remaining valuation
allowance is deemed appropriate by management in view of the expiration date of
the net operating losses and credits and the amount of future taxable income
necessary to utilize such losses and credits. If the full value of the deferred
tax assets were to be realized in future years, Excess Reorganization Value
would be further reduced by $11.5 million.

        On March 15, 1994, the Company filed its federal income tax return for
the year ended June 30, 1993, which reflected net operating loss carryforwards
of $55.8 million plus tax credits of $7.1 million. The net operating losses
expire in varying amounts in fiscal years 2003 to 2007 and the tax credits
expire in fiscal years 2000 to 2009. These figures reflect the adjustments
required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code after an ownership change
in the Company's stock. Section 382 will also require the Company to reduce the
tax basis of its assets by approximately $40.0 million. An ownership change is
defined as occurring when, during any three year period, the Company's 5%
shareholders (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) increase their ownership
in the Company's stock by more than 50 percentage points. The Plan of
Reorganization resulted in an ownership change since substantially all of the
new stock was issued to the creditors of the Company.

        As of June 30, 1994, the net operating loss carryforward is estimated to
have been reduced to $29.5 million as a result of the application of the losses
to reduce taxable income for fiscal 1994. The Company expects the remaining net
operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes to be available to offset
future income taxes, subject to applicable limits. However, should a second
ownership change occur within two years of the first ownership change, all the
remaining pre-confirmation net operating losses, tax credits and other tax
attributes would be eliminated. The Plan of Reorganization provided for the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation dated March 9, 1993 to contain
restrictions through June 30, 1996 on the transfer of stock to the reorganized
company's 5% stockholders (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) or those
that would become 5% stockholders as a result of the purported transfer.

        In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for
income taxes and any adjustments which have been or may be necessary will not
material affect the4 Company's financial position.

6. CAPITAL STOCK

        Capital Stock - The Plan of Reorganization provided for the filing by
the Company of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation which authorized the
issuance of 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value ("the Common
Stock"), and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
Plan of Reorganization, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of its new Common
Stock. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. The Common Stock is traded
on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "NCSI". The Restated Certificate
of Incorporation provides restrictions with respect to the trading of Common
Stock to or from persons or entities (i) who directly or indirectly own 5% or
more of the value of Common Stock or (ii) who would directly or indirectly own
5% or more of the value of Common Stock after giving effect to the proposed
transfer. The restriction expires on June 30, 1996, and serves as a means of
preserving the benefits of the pre-confirmation tax attributes of the Company
(see Note 5). As of June 30, 1994, the Company had 6,050,069 shares of Common
Stock outstanding.

        Warrants to Purchase Common Stock - The Plan of Reorganization provided
for the issuance of 1,350,000 Warrants to Purchase Common Stock (the "Warrants")
pursuant to the terms of a Warrant Agreement dated March 9, 1993. Each Warrant
provides the holder thereof with the right to purchase an equal number of shares
of Common Stock at an exercise price of $17.75 per share. The Warrant Agreement
has a term of five years and Warrants not exercised prior to March 9, 1998 shall
automatically become void and no longer outstanding. The Warrants are publicly
traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "NCSIW". During fiscal
year 1994, 69 warrants were exercised at a price of $17.75, resulting in
1,349,931 Warrants outstanding at June 30, 1994.

        1993 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan - The Plan of Reorganization
provided for the adoption on March 9, 1993 of the 1993 Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan (the "Option Plan"). Under the Option Plan, 900,000 shares of Common
Stock are reserved for awards to be granted to certain key management employees
and directors in order to encourage participants to acquire proprietary
interests in the Company. The Option Plan provides for the original issuance of
Reorganization Options, as defined, with a stated exercise price of $10.50 per
share; any cancelled Reorganization Options may be subsequently reissued as
Additional Options, as defined, at a stated exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. All options expire ten
years from the date of the grant and are exercisable commencing one year from
the date of grant on a cumulative basis at the rate of 33 1/3% per year. The
following summarizes the stock option transactions:

7. LEASE ARRANGEMENTS

        The Company leases a majority of its convenience stores and support
facilities, its corporate headquarters and certain equipment under operating
lease agreements. Generally, these leases have initial terms of ten to twenty
years, with one to three renewal options for additional five-year periods. It is
expected that these leases will be renewed or replaced with similar leases. Some
of the leases provide for additional rentals based upon a percentage of sales,
and many provide for the payment of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance
expenses. Some of these leases also have escalation clauses. The Company has no
significant capital leases.

        Future non-cancelable minimum rental commitments for operating leases
with an initial or remaining term of more than one year as of June 30, 1994,
are:

               Year Ending June 30,
               1995 ................................   $ 19,432

        The above commitments have not been reduced by $2.4 million of future
rental income under non-cancelable subleases.

8. BENEFIT PLANS

        The Company has a profit sharing plan available to substantially all
employees. The plan allows participants to contribute to the plan on a
before-tax basis pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Since
fiscal 1987, the Company matched 25% of such contributions up to 6% of the
employees' compensation. The Company suspended the matching contributions
effective as of October 1, 1991. Effective on July 1, 1993, the Company resumed
matching contributions at a level equal to 100% of the employees' before-tax
contributions, up to 3% of compensation. In addition to the matching
contributions, in fiscal 1994 the Company made a special $1.5 million
contribution to the plan, to be allocated to all eligible employees using a
formula based on tenure and compensation. Contributions to the plan were
$2,540,000 in fiscal 1994, $0 in fiscal 1993 and $32,000 in fiscal 1992.

        Prior to the Petition Date, the Company's matching contributions were
invested primarily in the predecessor company's common stock. Effective in July
of 1993, employees were given the option of investing company contributions in a
number of different investment funds, including a company stock fund. As of the
Effective Date of the Plan of Reorganization, the Profit Sharing Plan owned
approximately 568,000 shares of the predecessor company's common stock. Pursuant
to the Plan of Reorganization, these shares were exchanged for 2,127 shares of
newly issued Common Stock, and 3,545 Warrants. As of June 30, 1994 the Profit
Sharing Plan owned 9,127 shares of Company Common Stock and 3,545 Warrants.

        On March 31, 1994, the Company adopted two non-qualified retirement
plans for (i) certain officers and other key employees, and (ii) directors. The
plan covering key employees provides benefit payments based on years of service
and the employees' average earnings over the last five years. The plan covering
directors provides benefit payments based on years of service and the annual
retainer fees paid to the director. The Company has established two irrevocable
trusts to hold and invest assets to be used for the payment of benefits under
the plans. Such assets, totalling $175,000 at June 30, 1994, are considered
general assets of the Company. Charges to expense and funding amounts are based
upon amounts computed by independent actuaries. The Company made contributions
and recorded corresponding expenses totalling $175,000 in fiscal 1994. Also, an
additional liability of $2,067,000 and an intangible asset of equal amount were
recorded on the balance sheet at June 30, 1994.

        Net pension cost in fiscal 1994 for the two plans included the following
components:

9. CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION

     Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing - On December 9, 1991 (the "Petition
Date"), the Company and substantially all of its wholly-owned active
subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Subsequent to the
Petition Date, the Company operated its business as a debtor-in-possession under
the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. As of the Petition Date, actions to
collect pre-petition indebtedness were stayed and other contractual obligations
could not be enforced against the Company. In addition, under the Bankruptcy
Code, the Company could reject leases and executory contracts. Parties affected
by these rejections could file claims with the Bankruptcy Court in accordance
with the reorganization process. Substantially all liabilities as of the
Petition Date were subject to settlement under a plan of reorganization to be
voted upon by the creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

     Plan of Reorganization - As a result of extensive negotiations held in
December 1992, the Company reached a compromise agreement with representatives
of all of its major creditor constituencies, as well as two of the predecessor
company's largest common stockholders. This compromise agreement was then
incorporated into and became the Plan of Reorganization. Subsequently, on
January 6, 1993, a supplemental disclosure statement, along with a ballot, was
sent to all members of each class of creditors and equity interest holders
entitled to vote for acceptance or rejection of the Plan of Reorganization. As
of February 16, 1993, all such classes of creditors and equity interest holders
entitled to vote had accepted the Plan of Reorganization by the requisite
number. Consequently, on February 24, 1993, the Bankruptcy Court commenced a
hearing that resulted in the entering of a court order confirming the Plan of
Reorganization on February 25, 1993. The Plan of Reorganization subsequently
became effective March 9, 1993 (the "Effective Date").

     The Plan of Reorganization was designed to repay all priority creditors
in full on the Effective Date or thereafter as provided in the Plan of
Reorganization and to repay secured creditors in full over time with interest.
Allowed unsecured claims totalling approximately $137.5 million were cancelled
in exchange for $9.3 million of cash, $1.0 million of new indebtedness and 5.91
million shares of newly issued Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
reorganized company. All existing Series E Preferred Stock and existing common
stock of the predecessor company were exchanged for an aggregate distribution of
90,000 shares of the newly issued Common Stock of the reorganized company.
Consequently, a total of 6.0 million shares of newly issued Common Stock of the
reorganized company were issued under the Plan of Reorganization. In addition,
warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate 1.35 million shares of newly
issued Common Stock at $17.75 per share were distributed to the holders of the
predecessor company's two publicly-held subordinated debenture series, the
Series E Preferred Stock and the old common stock. All alleged seniority rights
arising under the indentures relating to the publicly-held subordinated
debentures were deemed satisfied and cancelled as of the Effective Date. In
addition, the Plan of Reorganization authorized the issuance of stock options to
purchase up to 900,000 shares of Common Stock of the reorganized company to
certain key employees and directors at $10.50 per share (see Note 6).

     Fresh-start Reporting - In accounting for the effects of the
reorganization, the Company has adopted the fresh-start reporting provisions of
SOP 90-7 and reflected the effects of such adoption in the financial statements
beginning March 1, 1993. SOP 90-7 is applicable because the pre-reorganization
shareholders received less than 50% of the reorganized company's newly issued
Common Stock and the enterprise value of the assets of the reorganized company
is less than the total of all pre-petition allowed claims and post-petition
liabilities.

     In adopting fresh-start reporting, the Company, with the assistance of
its financial advisors, was required to determine its enterprise value, which
represents the fair market value of the entity before considering liabilities
and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the
entity immediately after the reorganization. The term enterprise value is
synonymous with the term reorganization value as defined by SOP 90-7. After
extensive negotiations between the Company and its various creditor
constituencies, the Company's enterprise value was determined to be within a
group of ranges that centered around a point estimate of $210.0 million. The
enterprise value of the Company was determined by consideration of several
factors and reliance





                                      37
<PAGE>   26

on various valuation methods, including discounted future cash flows, market
comparables and price/earnings ratios. All of the valuations depended in large
part upon the Company's projected future operating results and cash flows; such
projections included assumptions as to anticipated sales and margins, marketing
plans, operating expense levels and capital expenditure programs. Additional
assumptions and methods utilized in the determination of the enterprise value
included, (i) discount rates of 11% to 14%, (ii) statutory tax rates, (iii) five
year cash flows projections and (iv) terminal value based upon industry
comparable multiples applied to the discounted value of its post-estimated 1998
earnings and cash flows.

        The adjustments to reflect the adoption of fresh-start reporting,
including the adjustments to record assets and liabilities at their fair market
values and to reflect the adoption of SFAS 109, have been reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as of February 28, 1993, as
Fresh-Start Adjustments. In addition, the reorganized company's opening balance
sheet was further adjusted to eliminate existing equity and to reflect the
aforementioned $210.0 million enterprise value, which includes the establishment
of Excess Reorganization Value. Accordingly, a vertical black line is shown in
the consolidated financial statements to separate post-emergence operations from
those prior to March 1, 1993, since they have not been prepared on a comparable
basis.

        Extraordinary Gain - The Plan of Reorganization resulted in the
discharge of an estimated $309.4 million of pre-petition claims against the
Company through the distribution of $36.5 million in cash, $145.6 million of
debt and the issuance of 6.0 million shares of new Common Stock and 1.35
million warrants to purchase Common Stock. The value of the cash, debt
instruments and securities distributed was $61.5 million less than the claims
and the resultant gain was recorded as an extraordinary gain.

10. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES

        During the second quarter of fiscal year 1992, management of the
Company performed a comprehensive strategic review of company and store
operations which resulted in the recording of Restructuring and Other Special
Charges of $168.1 million in December 1991. The charges are summarized as
follows:

                                                                        ========
</TABLE>

        Restructuring Charges - A strategic review of company and store
operations performed by management resulted in the Company filing motions with
the Bankruptcy Court to reject 188 leases covering stores already closed as of
the Petition Date. In addition, after the Petition Date, the Company closed or
sold 267 stores (244 of which were leased). The Company's store closure and
associated lease rejection programs were based on evaluations of individual
stores, taking into consideration factors such as historical and projected cash
flow, lease or ownership terms, age and condition of the property, the nature
and amount of insurance claims, competition and the potential for future
changes to any of the foregoing. In connection with the review, the Company
wrote off the $16.2 million net book value of buildings and leasehold
improvements for such rejected leases and closed stores and wrote down the
related store equipment by $9.0 million to estimated salvage value. A liability
of $10.2 million was also recorded to cover anticipated future lease settlement
claims. In addition, the strategic review identified two geographical markets
for probable divestiture and the Company recorded a liability of $9.0 million
for the expected resultant loss. The Company subsequently sold the two
identified geographical markets, San Francisco Bay area and Atlanta, Georgia on
July 10, 1992 and April 29, 1994, respectively, at which time the liability was
depleted.

        In order to reduce cash expenditures, the Company's new store
development program was eliminated concurrent with the Chapter 11 filing.
Consequently, the Company elected to write down its nonoperating properties
(primarily undeveloped real estate) to current fair market value. 

        Due to the significant losses recorded by the Company prior to the
Petition Date, as well as the Chapter 11 filing itself, management of the
Company concluded that the goodwill previously recorded had been permanently
impaired and, therefore, it was written off.

        As a result of the decline in the Company's financial condition and the
Chapter 11 filing, all debt previously classified as long-term became
immediately due and payable under the terms of the related debt instruments.
Consequently, the Company wrote off the debt issue costs of $4.9 million which
were previously scheduled to be amortized over the remaining life of the
associated loans. Similarly, management of the Company reviewed various other
intangible assets and deferred charges and concluded that their value became
permanently impaired as a result of the Chapter 11 filing.

        Other charges consist primarily of an allowance for doubtful accounts
receivable of $3.9 million and a reserve of $5.0 million for expenses
associated with the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"). As a
result of the proposed termination of the ESOP, the Company eliminated the ESOP
reserve as a Fresh-Start Adjustment (see Note 9). The Company has requested a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax consequences of the
aformentioned






                                      41
<PAGE>   30
proposed termination of the ESOP, but to date has not received such ruling.

     Other Special Charges - As a result of significant increases in adverse
claims experience, as well as an increase in the frequency of the violence and
severity of claims, management of the Company implemented a detailed study of
the Company's insurance reserves which gave consideration to the nature and
frequency of claims, as well as historical settlements. The loss development
factors are actuarially-determined ratios devised to factor in the Company's
prior history with similar claims, taking into account the age, nature, severity
and frequency of such claims. Based upon this analysis, which was completed
during the second quarter of fiscal 1992, the Company recorded a $46.6 million
charge to increase its insurance liabilities.

     During the second quarter of fiscal 1992, the Company completed a
comprehensive plan covering its underground storage tanks in light of the
expected funding shortfalls in the various state reimbursement programs. As a
result, the Company recorded an increase to liabilities for environmental
remediation costs in the amount of $12.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal
1992. In connection with an updated environmental remediation cost analysis, the
Company increased its liabilities for future environmental remediation and
related tank removal costs by an additional $6.6 million in February 1993.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The operation and ownership of underground gasoline storage tanks ("USTs")
are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations.

     The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has issued regulations,
including most recently the 1988 amendment to the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, that establish requirements for (i) maintaining leak detection
methods and equipment, (ii) upgrading USTs, (iii) taking corrective action in
response to leaks, (iv) closing USTs to prevent future leaks, (v) keeping
appropriate records and (vi) maintaining evidence of financial responsibility
for taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury
and property damage resulting from releases. These regulations also empower
states to develop, administer and enforce their own regulatory programs,
incorporating requirements which are at least as stringent as the federal
standards. In order to ensure compliance with the federal and state
environmental laws, the Company has developed a comprehensive gasoline storage
and dispensing plan. During fiscal 1993, the Company refined the plan such that
presently its primary focus is on upgrading gasoline dispensing equipment in
accordance with upcoming deadlines imposed by regulatory authorities and on
providing for the clean-up of existing and future contaminated sites. The
gasoline plan generally covers all properties owned by the Company and leases
assumed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization.

     Environmental Capital Commitments - To meet the minimum federal leak
detection requirements, all product lines had to have line leak detectors
installed as of December 22, 1990, and as of December 22, 1993, the Company had
adopted approved tank system leak detection methods on all owned or operated
USTs. The Company chose, in most cases, to meet this requirement by utilizing
annual tank testing with daily inventory reconciliation. The Company installed
pressurized distribution piping with automatic line leak detectors as of
December 22, 1990, in accordance with the regulations. Beginning in fiscal year
1995, the Company will adopt the Statistical Inventory Reconciliation Method
("SIR") for the detection of leaking tanks. This method involves statistical
analysis of gasoline inventory changes to detect leaking USTs.

     The federal regulations require the Company to have installed
spill/overfill and corrosion protection equipment by December 22, 1998. However,
the State of Texas requires all USTs to be upgraded with the spill/overfill
prevention equipment by December 22, 1994. The Company estimates that, as of
June 30, 1994, 82% of its tanks have spill/overfill prevention equipment
installed. The Company's 1995 capital budget contains the necessary funds to
upgrade the remaining tanks with spill/overfill prevention equipment and,
consequently, the Company anticipates it will be in compliance with the December
22, 1994 deadline imposed by the State of Texas. The Company further estimates
that 70% of its USTs are protected from corrosion either by installing
fiberglass or steel fiberglass tanks or by upgrading existing steel tanks with
cathodic protection. Management of the Company believes that the Company's
long-range capital budget contains sufficient funds necessary to upgrade the
remaining tanks prior to the December 22, 1998 deadline.

     In addition to the foregoing, the EPA has ranked the air quality in major
cities in the United States based on the level of ozone measured. Two areas in
which the Company currently conducts operations are considered to be ozone
non-






                                      42
<PAGE>   31
attainment areas: Houston and the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The Houston market is
classified in the severe ozone non-attainment category while the Dallas/Fort
Worth area is classified in the moderate ozone non-attainment category. Under
rules promulgated by the EPA and the State of Texas, gasoline dispensing
facilities in the two areas are required to have Stage II Vapor Recovery
Equipment, by November 15, 1994, on all units except those that have not
dispensed more than 10,000 gallons in any one month since January 1991.

        During fiscal 1994 and 1993, the Company spent $6.6 million and $4.4
million, respectively, on environmental capital equipment, including $6.1
million and $3.1 million, respectively, on Stage II Vapor Recovery Equipment.
In order to ultimately comply with the aforementioned regulations by the
deadlines described, the Company estimates it will have to spend approximately
$11.8 million on additional equipment and installation through fiscal 1999,
including $6.0 million for Stage II Vapor Recovery Equipment.

        Environmental Remediation Contingency - The majority of the Company's
environmental remediation expenditures relate to the clean-up of contaminated
soil caused by leaking underground gasoline storage tanks and underground
piping systems. During the second quarter of fiscal year 1992 the Company
completed a comprehensive plan covering its underground storage tanks in light
of the expected funding shortfalls in the various state reimbursement programs.
As a result, the Company recorded an increase to the environmental remediation
liability of $16.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 1992. Not
included in this liability is approximately $4.0 million of reimbursements from
established state funds which the Company believes to be probable of recovery.
In connection with an updated environmental remediation cost analysis the
Company increased its liability for future environmental remediation and tank
removal costs by an additional $6.6 million in February 1993. As of June 30,
1993, the remediation liability totalled $18.2 million, net of the
aforementioned estimated $4.0 million of reimbursable costs. At June 30, 1994,
the remediation reserve totalled $21.8 million which included a $4.0 million
reclassification, recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 1994,
related to anticipated reimbursements for future expenditures from established
state trust funds which the Company believes to be probable of recovery.
Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year 1994, this $4.0 million amount
is also included as an other asset in the Company's balance sheet. The states
in which the Company operates, or has previously operated, have established
trust funds for the reimbursement of costs related to remediation activities.
The actual cost of remediating contaminated sites and removing tanks may be
substantially lower or higher than that reserved due to the difficulty in
estimating such costs and due to potential changes in the status of regulation
and state reimbursement programs. The Company does not believe that any such
amount below or in excess of that accrued is reasonably estimable.

        Since 1988, the Company has spent approximately $11.4 million for
remediation activities at sites the Company is operating or has previously
operated. Approximately 43% of such costs qualify for reimbursement from the
various trust funds and the Company has been reimbursed $3.7 million for such
costs through June 30, 1994. According to published reports, the Texas
Petroleum Storage Tank Reimbursement Fund was depleted during 1993 which has
necessitated delaying payment on reimbursement applications. As of June 30,
1994, the Company had filed claims with the State of Texas for the
reimbursement of $1.2 million for past expenditures. Such reimbursement is
included in other assets. While the Company believes the reimbursements are
collectible, the Company estimates it could be several years before
reimbursement occurs.

        The Company is required by state regulations to maintain evidence of
financial responsibility for taking corrective action on remediation
activities. In order to be in compliance with these requirements, the Company
has successfully established that it is self-insured, with verification by the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

        Litigation - The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Management does not
expect that any of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position.
