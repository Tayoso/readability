            General Development of Business

            Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc. was incorporated  under the laws of
            Louisiana  in 1965 and is the successor to various  predecessor
            corporations   and  partnerships  which  operated  "Piccadilly"
            cafeterias beginning  with the acquisition of the first unit in
            1944.  Except where the  context otherwise indicates, the terms
            "Company", "Piccadilly", and  "Registrant" as used herein refer
            to  Piccadilly  Cafeterias,  Inc.,  its  predecessors  and  its
            subsidiaries.
            
            At June 30, 1994, the Company  operated  130  cafeterias  in 16
            states.    Of  these,  63  were  in  suburban malls, 22 were in
            suburban  strip  centers,  and  45 were free-standing  suburban
            locations.  Approximately 10 new  cafeterias are expected to be
            opened  during the year ending June  30,  1995.  The  following
            table sets  forth  certain information regarding development of
            the Company's cafeteria  chain during the five years ended June
            30, 1994:

            During  1988,  the  Company  acquired  substantially all of the
            assets  of  the  Ralph  &  Kacoo's  seafood  restaurant  chain,
            headquartered   in   Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana,  including   six
            restaurants, a warehouse  and  seafood distribution facility, a
            catering  facility,  and a seafood  processing  facility.   The
            Company  holds  a  federally  registered  tradename,  "Ralph  &
            Kacoo's," and a federally  registered  trademark on its Ralph &
            Kacoo's catfish logo.
            
            At June 30, 1994 the Company operated seven "Ralph and Kacoo's"
            seafood restaurants in Louisiana, Mississippi  and  Texas.  One
            Ralph & Kacoo's seafood restaurant is expected to be  opened in
            the year ending June 30, 1995.  The following table sets  forth
            certain  information  regarding  development  of  the Company's
            restaurant chain during the five years ended June 30, 1994:

Although the  Company's  operations are in the southern, southwestern, and
western regions of the United States, the Company does not consider its 
growth to be limited to such areas.  During the year ended June 30, 1994, 
the Company opened its first cafeterias in Kansas City, Kansas and St. Louis, 
Missouri. During  the year ending June 30, 1995, the Company expects to open  
its first cafeterias in Louisville, Kentucky and Chicago, Illinois. 
Piccadilly evaluates numerous potential expansion locations each year, 
focusing on demographic  data  such  as  population densities, population 
profiles, income levels, traffic counts, as well as the extent of competition. 
The number of new cafeterias and restaurants that the  Company can open depends
upon its ability to secure appropriate locations, generate necessary financial
Resources, and develop personnel for expansion.

Financial Information about Industry Segments
_______________________________________________

Under the provisions of Statement 14 of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, the Company has determined that, during all periods included herein,
its business constituted a single reportable industry segment --  "cafeteria
and restaurant operations."

Cafeteria and Restaurant Operations
____________________________________

The Company's cafeterias seat from 250 to 450 customers each.  Each unit
offers a wide variety of food, at reasonable prices,  and with the convenience
of cafeteria service, to a diverse luncheon and dinner  clientele.   Cafeteria
personnel  cook  and prepare from scratch substantially all food served.   All
items  are prepared  from  standardized  recipes.  Menus  are  varied  at  the
discretion  of  unit  management  in  response  to  local  and  seasonal  food
preferences.

Like  most industry participants, the Company purchases foodstuffs (other than
some basic staples) through local or regional suppliers in small quantities in
order to  better  ensure freshness.  As a result, inventory is kept relatively
low; average per-cafeteria-inventory  at  June  30, 1994 was $15,000.  Food is
typically purchased on 30-day credit terms and sold  for  cash within such 30-
day period, thereby favorably affecting cash flow.
            
Ralph  &  Kacoo's  restaurants  seat  from  250 to 600 customers  each.  These
restaurants are full-service menu facilities.   All  of  the  food  served  is
cooked  and  prepared  by  the  restaurant  staff  from  standardized recipes.
Substantially all of the food, supplies, and other materials  required for the
preparation of meals are supplied by the Company-owned commissary.

The  commissary,  located  in  Baton  Rouge, Louisiana, contains approximately
26,500 square feet of restaurant food and  supplies storage.  Seafood accounts
for approximately 50% of inventory at the commissary.   In  order  to  provide
consistent  quality,  selection, and price throughout the year, the commissary
purchases in-season seafood in quantities sufficient to supply the restaurants
during  periods  when such  products  would  otherwise  not  be  available  at
reasonable prices in the marketplace.  On the average, seafood inventory turns
approximately once  every four months.  Inventory maintained at the commissary
at June 30, 1994, was  approximately  $2,692,000  while the average restaurant
inventory level at year-end was approximately $44,000.   The commissary is not
dependent upon a single supplier nor a small group of suppliers.

Each cafeteria and restaurant is operated as a separate unit under the control
of a manager and associate manager who have responsibility  for  virtually all
aspects  of  the  unit's business including purchasing, food preparation,  and
employee matters.   Twelve  district  managers, under the supervision of three
region managers, the president, and the  chief  executive officer, oversee and
regularly  inspect cafeteria operations. Three district  managers,  under  the
supervision  of  a  region  manager  and  the chief executive officer, oversee
restaurant operations.  The Company employed  approximately  7,300  persons at
June  30,  1994,  of  whom  all  but  77  general  office  employees worked at
Piccadilly's 137 cafeteria and restaurant locations and its commissary.

The food service industry is highly competitive.  Competitive  factors include
food  quality and variety, price, customer service, location, the  number  and
proximity of competitors, decor, and public reputation.  The Company considers
its principal  competitors to be other cafeterias, casual dining concepts, and
fast-food operations.   Like  other  food service operations, the Company must
remain attuned to changes in both consumer  preferences for food and habits in
patronizing eating establishments.
            
Customer  volume at established cafeterias and  sales  volume  at  established
restaurants  are  generally  higher in the Company's second fiscal quarter and
lower  in the third quarter.  These  patterns  reflect  the  general  seasonal
fluctuations of the retail industry.
            
Cost of  sales  is  affected  by  statutory minimum wage rates.  The Company's
operations are subject to federal,  state,  and  local  laws  and  regulations
relating to environmental protection, including regulation of discharges  into
the  air  and  water,  and relating to safety and labor, including the Federal
Occupational Safety and  Health Act and wage and hour laws.  Additionally, the
Company's operations are regulated  pursuant to state and local sanitation and
public health laws.  Operating units  utilize  electricity  and  natural  gas,
which  are  subject  to  various  federal and state regulations concerning the
allocation  of energy.  The Company's  operating  costs  have  been  and  will
continue to be affected by increases in the cost of energy.

Item 2.  Properties

All but 18 of  the  cafeterias and restaurants operated by the Company at June
30, 1994, were held under  long-term  leases  with  differing  provisions  and
expiration  dates.  The 18 cafeterias and restaurants not held under long-term
leases are owned.   Leases  provide for monthly rentals, typically computed on
the basis of a fixed amount plus  a  percentage of sales.  Most leases contain
provisions permitting the Company to renew  for  one  or more specified terms.
These  leases  are  scheduled to expire, exclusive of renewal  provisions, as
follows:

new cafeterias and restaurants  in terms of seating, food display, preparation
areas, and other factors and attempts  to  build  out  floor space to maximize
efficient use of available space.

The  Company  continues  to  pursue  strategies to increase the  capacity  and
utilization of its cafeterias.  Although  most of the Company's cafeterias are
single-line,  33 of the Company's cafeterias  are  double-line  which  provide
increased capacity  at  peak hours.   The Company does not currently intend to
convert any of its single-line cafeterias to double-line.

Piccadilly's general offices  occupy  approximately  two-thirds  of a Company-
owned  45,000 square foot office building completed in 1974 and located  on  a
Company-owned  tract  comprising  approximately  five  acres  in  Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.  The remainder of the building is leased to commercial tenants.

  Opening cash balances of $14,094,000 combined with cash generated from
operations  of $23,426,000 were primarily used to fund $35,645,000  of fiscal
year  1994  capital expenditures and debt  maturities.   Working capital
decreased $28,106,000 during fiscal year 1994 primarily due to the capital
expenditures made in fiscal year 1994 and the increase  in  current maturities
of long-term debt.  The Company has maintained a $10,000,000 unsecured, short-
term line of credit. This facility was not utilized during fiscal  year  1994.
As of August 8, 1994,  $5,150,000 of this facility was available.

  For fiscal year 1995, total capital expenditures are expected to approximate
$40,000,000 to $45,000,000 and will include purchases of land, construction of
eight to ten new units, and major remodels to 25 to 30 existing cafeterias and
restaurants. Also  during  fiscal year 1995, $5,250,000 of the note payable to
bank and $6,000,000 of the 10.15%  senior  notes  will become due.  Management
has begun negotiations and anticipates obtaining bank  financing  to fund both
capital  expenditures  and  maturing  debt  in  excess of the resources to  be
generated from operations.
            
  During fiscal year 1994, the Company accelerated its new unit expansion and
completed  the first year of a five-year plan to remodel all of  its  existing
cafeterias. The following table presents a summary of capital expenditures for
the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992:

 Historically, the Company has leased land for the majority of its freestanding
cafeteria units.  Beginning in fiscal year 1993, the Company began to purchase
land for the  majority  of its new units.  The total investment required for a
freestanding unit is higher  than for strip-center or shopping mall locations.
All of the units opened in  fiscal years 1994 and 1993 are freestanding units.
Of the four units opened in fiscal year 1992, one is freestanding, one is in a
shopping mall, and two are located  in  strip-centers.   The  Company  expects
that, prospectively, most of its new unit openings will be freestanding.

  Major unit remodels generally include a substantial redesign of the unit.
Capital expenditures for these units include  replacement  of  decor,  carpet,
furniture  and  fixtures,  and  exterior  signage.   Minor  unit  remodels are
generally limited to replacement of carpeting, minor decor upgrades, additions
of take-out stands, and/or in some cases, replacement of exterior  signage.

                               ______________________________________


  Cafeteria sales for fiscal year 1994 increased $5,307,000, or 2.1%, from
fiscal year 1993.   Price increases effective  November 1993 and May 1994 were
sufficient to offset the  overall customer decline of 4.9%.  The overall check
average increased 5.2% from $5.00 for fiscal year  1993  to  $5.26  for fiscal
year 1994.
            
  Ralph & Kacoo's restaurant sales decreased $544,000, or 2.3%.  No Ralph  &
Kacoo's restaurants were opened or closed during fiscal year 1994.
  
  During fiscal year 1994, operating profits (net sales less cost of sales and
other operating expenses) improved from  8.8%  of  net  sales  to 10.3% of net
sales. Food costs and labor costs as a percentage of sales decreased  1.5% and
0.7%,   respectively.   These  improvements  were  somewhat  offset  by  other
operating expense which increased from 32.7% of net sales for fiscal year 1993
to 33.4% of net sales for fiscal year 1994.
            
  Four units closed in fiscal year 1994. All of these units had substantially 
reached the end of their  respective  lease  terms.   Other  operating expense
includes  a  provision  of  $100,000  relating to losses associated  with  the
closing of these units.
            
  Other expense for 1994 increased $876,000 compared to fiscal year 1993. This
increase is largely attributable to non-cash  write-offs  related to remodeled
units amounting to $996,000.

  The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 was enacted into law on August  10,
1993.  This Act,  combined  with  an increase in the Company's effective state
income tax rate,  resulted in an increase  of  the Company's current effective
income tax rate from 37% to 39% for fiscal year 1994.

  Cafeteria sales for fiscal year 1993 decreased $19,192,000, or 7.2%, from
fiscal year 1992. The decrease in sales is attributable to the change in same-
store customer traffic and the operations  of cafeterias reserved for closing.
Sales  from these units, for the first three  quarters  of  fiscal  year  1992
($10,109,000),  are  included  in  fiscal  year  1992 reported amounts.  Price
changes  had  little  effect on the comparison of year-to-year  sales  as  the
customer check average for fiscal year 1993 increased 0.7% to $5.00 from $4.96
for fiscal year 1992.
            
  Ralph & Kacoo's restaurant sales decreased $4,466,000, or 15.7%. Most of the
decline is attributable to the operations of restaurants reserved for closing.
Sales from these units, for the first  three  quarters  of  fiscal  year  1992
($3,220,000),  are  included  in  fiscal year 1992 reported amounts. Sales for
restaurants open the entire 12 months  of  fiscal year 1993 and 1992 decreased
3.8%.
            
  During fiscal year 1993, operating profits (net sales less cost of sales and
other operating expenses) declined from 9.6% of  net  sales  to  8.8%  of  net
sales.  Food  costs and labor costs as a percentage of sales increased .7% and

<PAGE> 20

1.2%, respectively.  These  costs  of  sales increase to the Company's
emphasis on food quality and customer service.
            
 Provisions for write-offs of certain assets in the third quarter significantly
impacted  operating  results  for  fiscal  year  1992.  The  Company  recorded
provisions  of  $45,760,000  ($30,904,000  after-tax,   or  $3.16  per  share)
consisting primarily of a provision for unit closings and the write-off of the
remaining book value of intangible assets associated with  the  acquisition of
the Ralph & Kacoo's  seafood  restaurant  chain  in  fiscal  year  1989.
Management's decision  to write off the remaining book value of the intangible
assets ($10,952,000 after-tax,  or  $1.12  per share) reflected the lower than
expected financial performance of the restaurant  chain. Amortization of these
intangibles, after-tax, was $815,000 for fiscal year  1992  ($.08  per share).
The  remaining  $31,152,000  ($19,952,000  after-tax,  or  $2.04  per  share),
reflected a provision for the closing of 15 units that had not performed  well
and  appeared  to  have  limited potential for improvement in the future. This
provision consisted primarily  of reserves for the write-off of assets and the
payment of future lease obligations.   All  of  the units reserved for closing
were closed or returned to operations as of June  30,  1993.  The  closure  of
these  units has had a positive effect on after-tax cash flow from operations.
Operating  results  prior  to March 31, 1992, for these 15 units, exclusive of
provisions for unit closings  and the write-off of intangibles, are summarized
as follows:

rent  obligations  not  offset  by  sublease  arrangements.  Several  of these
properties are under varying stages of sublease negotiation.  Management  will
continue  to  pursue disposition of those properties at terms favorable to the
Company either through lease buy-out arrangements or subleasing.

KNOWN TRENDS OR  UNCERTAINTIES.   Generally, the Company has experienced sales
growth primarily from selling price  increases and net increases in the number
of operating units. The Company believes  that same-store declines in customer
traffic result primarily from the increased number of eating establishments in
the  markets  where  the  Company operates.  The  Company  believes  that  its
programs  to enhance product  quality,  service,  and  dining  atmosphere  are
essential to  increase customer traffic and ensure long-term profitability and
growth.

 Most of the Company's operating costs are subject to inflationary pressures.
Historically, the Company has generally  been  able  to maintain its operating
margins through increases in selling prices.
 
 Congress is considering several proposals for national health care
legislation.  Management   cannot   predict   the  ultimate  passage of such
legislation nor its impact on the Company. The  Company  does  provide  health
insurance coverage to those employees who voluntarily participate in the plan.
Generally,  the Company absorbs approximately 50% of the costs under the plan.
The Company has  recorded  expenses  (net  of employee premiums) for the three
fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, amounting  to  $3,180,000,  $3,224,000,  and
$2,999,000, respectively. At June 30, 1994, approximately 25% of the Company's
employees were participating in the plan.
 
 The Company is not aware of other material trends that may be expected to
cause reported financial information not to be indicative of future operating
results or of future financial condition.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.

Note A - Significant Accounting Policies
       
PRINCIPLES   OF   CONSOLIDATION.   The   accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements  include  the  accounts  of Piccadilly  Cafeterias,  Inc.  and  its
subsidiaries  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Company).  All  significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

INDUSTRY. The Company's principal industry  is  the operation of Company-owned

CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash equivalents include those  temporary  investments  that
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, have original maturities  of
three  months  or less, and have insignificant risk of changes in value due to
changes in interest  rates. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet
for these instruments approximate their fair values.
            
INVENTORIES. Inventories consist primarily of food and supplies and are stated 
at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  is stated at
cost.  Depreciation  is  provided using the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes on the following estimated useful lives:
     Buildings and component equipment                 10-30 years
     Furniture and fixtures                               10 years
     Machinery and equipment                               4 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the original lease term,
including renewal periods  if  applicable.  The cost of leasehold improvements
has  been  reduced  by  the amount of construction  allowances  received  from
developers and landlords. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as
incurred. Renewals and betterments  which  increase  the  value  or extend the
lives  of  assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated  useful
lives. When  assets  are  retired,  or are otherwise disposed of, cost and the
related accumulated depreciation are  eliminated  from  the  accounts  and any
resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of income.
            
INCOME  TAXES.  During fiscal 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards  No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," which
prescribes the liability  method  for  computing  deferred  taxes, wherein tax
rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences arising  from  different
financial  and income tax accounting treatment of income and deductions  based
on when and  how  these  differences  are expected to affect future income tax
returns. Deferred income taxes are adjusted  for  tax rate changes. The effect
of the adoption of SFAS 109 was not material.
            
UNIT OPENING EXPENSES. Salaries and wages, training  costs  and other expenses
of opening new units are charged to expense during the first  month of the new
unit's operation.
            
EARNINGS  PER  SHARE.  Earnings  per  share of Common Stock are based  on  the
weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Note B - Provision for Unit Closings and Asset Write-Offs
In March 1992, the Company provided $45,760,000  ($30,904,000  after-tax)  for
the  write-off  of  intangible  assets  and  estimated disposition costs of 15
operating  units. The write-off of the remaining  book  value  of  $14,608,000
($10,952,000  after-tax)  of the intangible assets associated with the Ralph &
Kacoo's seafood chain reflected  the lower than expected financial performance
of this chain. The remaining $31,152,000  ($19,952,000  after-tax) reflected a
provision for the anticipated closing of 15 units that had  not performed well
and  appeared  to have limited potential for improvement in the  future.  This
provision consisted  primarily of reserves for the write-off of assets and the
payment of future lease  obligations.  As  of  June 30, 1993, all of the units
reserved for closing have been closed or returned  to  operations. Included in
property,  plant  and equipment, net of related accumulated  depreciation,  is
$2,671,000 and $3,622,000  at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, for closed
units.

The  Company's  tax  returns  are  currently under examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for the fiscal  years  ended June 30, 1987 through 1992.
The  IRS  has  proposed  adjustments to the Company's  tax  returns  primarily
related to the amortization  of  intangible  assets  and the timing of certain
other  deductions.  The  Company is vigorously contesting  these  matters  and
believes that the ultimate  resolution  of  these  examinations  will  not  be
material to the financial position of the Company.

Note D - Commitments
            
The  Company rents most of its cafeteria and restaurant facilities under long-
term leases  with  varying  provisions and with original lease terms generally
being 20 to 30 years. The Company  has  the  option  to  renew  the leases for
specified  periods  subsequent  to their original terms. Minimum future  lease
commitments, including $18,533,000  for those units closed (see Note B), as of
June 30, 1994, are as follows:

==============================================================================

The aggregate maturities  of  long-term  debt  for  each  of  the five years
following June 30, 1994, are as follows: 1995-$11,250,000, 1996-$6,000,000,
1997-$6,000,000, 1998-$6,000,000, 1999-$6,000,000.  The  fair  value  of  the
Company's  long-term  borrowings  are  estimated  using  discounted  cash flow
analyses,  based  on  the  Company's  current  incremental borrowing rates for
similar types of borrowing arrangements.

In January 1989, the Company issued unsecured senior  notes  in  the principal
amount  of $30,000,000 at an interest rate of 10.15%. These notes are  payable
at $6,000,000  per  year beginning January 31, 1995, and ending on January 31,
1999. The Company has  a prepayment option, subject to a premium, which can be
exercised at any time during the term of the senior notes.

The $5,250,000 note payable  to  bank is unsecured and bears interest based on
applicable rates and margins. The  interest  rate  in effect at June 30, 1994,
(5.734%) was based upon London InterBank Offered Rate  (LIBOR)  plus 50%. The

Company  has  a prepayment option, without penalty, who any time during the
term of the note.

Both long-term  facilities  contain covenants which include provisions for the
maintenance  of  net worth, limitations  on  the  level  of  liabilities,  and
requirements for minimum  coverage  of  fixed  charges.  At June 30, 1994, the
Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company has a line-of-credit arrangement with  a  bank  under  which up to
$10,000,000  can  be  borrowed.   At  June 30, 1994, $10,000,000 was available
under this agreement.

The Company capitalized interest cost of  $300,000  in  1994  with  respect to
qualifying construction. Total interest cost incurred was $3,389,000  in 1994,
$3,521,000 in 1993 and $4,044,000 in 1992.

Note F - Pension and Bonus Plan
            
The Company has a pension plan covering substantially all employees who meet
certain  age and length-of-service requirements. Retirement benefits are based
upon an employee's  years  of credited service and final average compensation.
Annual contributions are made  in  amounts  sufficient to fund normal costs as
accrued and to amortize prior service costs over a 40-year period. Assets of
the  plan  are  invested  principally  in  obligations  of the  United  States
Government and other marketable debt and equity securities  including  367,662
shares  of the Company's Common Stock held at June 30, 1994 and 277,562 shares
at June 30, 1993.

The following tables set forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized
in the Company's financial statements.

The  Company  also  provides  bonus  compensation  to cafeteria and restaurant
managers based on unit profitability. Charges to expense for such compensation
amounted  to $9,982,000, $9,305,000, and $10,951,000  during  1994,  1993  and
1992, respectively.

Note G - Common Stock

On August 3,  1987,  the Board of Directors adopted the Piccadilly Cafeterias,
Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Shareholders of record may
reinvest quarterly dividends  and/or up to $5,000 per quarter in the Company's
Common Stock. Stock obtained through  reinvested  dividends  is issued at a 5%
discount. The Company has reserved 500,000 shares for issuance under the plan.
Common Shares issued under the plan were 26,366 and 19,962 for the years ended
June  30,  1994 and 1993, respectively. At June 30, 1994, there  were  407,669
unissued Common Shares reserved under the plan.

On November  2,  1987,  the  Company's  stockholders  adopted the Piccadilly
Cafeterias,  Inc.  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan.  Under  the plan, eligible
employees  may  be  granted options to purchase up to 1,500 shares  of  Common
Stock annually. Options  are exercisable at 85% of the applicable market value
provided that this value is  greater  than book value per share. If 85% of the
applicable  market  value  is less than book  value  per  share,  options  are
exercisable at book value per share. Options are exercisable at the applicable
market value if the applicable market value is less than book value per share.
The applicable market value is the lower of the beginning of the plan year and
the end of the plan year market  price.  Book value per share is determined as
of  the  most  recent audited balance sheet date.  The  Company  has  reserved
1,000,000 shares  of  stock  for issuance under the plan. Common Shares issued

outstanding. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the holders of rights  are
entitled  to purchase additional shares of the Company's Common Stock from the
Company at  an  exercise  price of $60 per share. Additionally, the holders of
rights  may be entitled to purchase  either  the  Company's  Common  Stock  or
securities of an acquiring entity at half of market value.

On November  1,  1993,  the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the Piccadilly
Cafeterias, Inc. 1993 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 1993 Plan).  Under  the

qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock  awards,  restricted
stock,  performance shares and cash awards may be granted to officers  or  key

issued at no less than 100% of the fair  market  value  on  the date of grant.

Auditors' Report
Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors
Shareholders and Board of Directors
Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

We  have  audited  the  accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Piccadilly
Cafeterias, Inc. as of June  30,  1994  and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of  the  three  years  in  the period ended June  30,  1994.  These  financial
statements  are  the  responsibility   of   the   Company's   management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and perform the  audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes  examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the  financial  statements. An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall  financial
statement presentation. We believe  that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all  material  respects,  the consolidated financial  position  of  Piccadilly
Cafeterias, Inc. at June 30,  1994  and  1993, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each  of  the  three years in the period
ended  June  30,  1994  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles.
