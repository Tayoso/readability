ITEM I.       BUSINESS
- - ------
              General and Industry Segments
              -----------------------------

                      The Company is engaged primarily in the manufacture of
              rubber and plastic parts requiring a substantial degree of
              product engineering and high-volume production processes for
              automotive original equipment manufacturers in the United States,
              Canada, France, the United Kingdom and other European countries
              (the "Transportation Equipment Segment").  This segment also
              produces rubber and plastic parts for the appliance, construction
              and marine industries.  The Company also manufactures precure and
              mold cure tread rubber for the truck tire retreading industry
              (the "Tread Rubber Segment").

                      Reference is made to "Notes to Consolidated Financial
              Statements" included on page 25 and 26 of the Company's 1994
              Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated herein by reference,
              for additional financial information concerning the Company's
              reportable business segments and geographic areas.

                      In January 1993, the Company acquired all of the issued
              and outstanding shares of capital stock of Standard Products
              Industriel (SPI), a corporation organized under French law.  See
              "Foreign Operations" for a discussion of SPI and its operations.
              In December 1992, the Company increased its ownership in its
              North American joint venture, Nishikawa Standard Company (NISCO)
              to 50% from 40% by making additional capital contributions and by
              purchasing partnership units from the Company's partner,
              Nishikawa Rubber Company, of Hiroshima, Japan.  In July 1992, the
              Company's subsidiary, Holm Industries, Inc., acquired the assets
              of Jarrow Products, a manufacturer of plastic extrusion products
              for commercial appliances and building door sealing systems.  In
              fiscal 1991, the Company discontinued the manufacture of
              rubberized track for military vehicles.  See the section
              "Discontinued Operations" for a discussion of developments which
              have occurred regarding these operations during the past year.

                      The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1927 and was 
              consolidated in 1936 with the Reid Products Company.

              TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT SEGMENT

              Automotive Original Equipment
              -----------------------------

                      PRODUCTS.  Rubber products supplied to the automotive
              manufacturing industry include flocked rubber and steel
              weatherstrip assemblies to seal vehicle windows; flocked rubber
              window channel assemblies and rubber window gaskets; and vehicle
              body and door dynamic sealing systems.  These products form the
              sealing system of automotive vehicles preventing water leakage
              and inhibiting wind noise from entering the vehicle.
              Attractiveness of design is an important feature of the sealing
              system.  An increasing number of the Company's parts are sold to
              automotive original equipment manufacturers as complete sealing
              systems.  This is a departure from former practices which
              involved more suppliers who supplied individual parts, not
              complete systems.  The Company also supplies molded rubber engine
              mounts and body cushions, which comprise a vehicle's vibration
              control system, to the automotive manufacturing industry.
              Plastic products include metallized, multicolored and embossed
              exterior and interior vinyl trim and flocked vinyl and steel
              weatherstrip assemblies.  The plastic exterior products serve as
              protective barriers preventing damage to the vehicle's sheet
              metal and have become an integral part of the vehicle's overall
              styling and appearance.  Although reliable industry statistics
              are not available, the Company believes that it is one of the
              leading independent manufacturers of rubber window and door
              weather sealing products and plastic trim for the automotive
              industry.

                      MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS.  The Company manufactures parts
              and accessories for automotive and truck original equipment
              manufacturers in the United States, Canada, France and the United
              Kingdom and other European countries.  Manufacturing operations
              for the automotive original equipment market of this segment are
              conducted by the Company, Standard Products (Canada) Limited,
              Standard Products Limited and Standard Products Industriel.
              Approximately 56%, 65% and 71% of the Company's annual revenues
              in its 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years, respectively, were
              attributable to direct worldwide sales to General Motors
              Corporation, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Motors Corporation.
              Since most of the Company's rubber and plastic automotive
              products are used on original equipment, sales of such products
              are directly affected by the annual car production of original
              equipment manufacturers.  Original equipment sales are based upon
              purchase orders issued annually by automobile manufacturers for
              each part which the Company manufactures.  The purchase orders
              are for all or a percentage of the customers' estimated
              requirements and are binding, subject to the annual car
              production of original equipment manufacturers.  As the year
              evolves, customers issue releases under those purchase orders,
              specifying quantities of the parts which the assembly plants
              require.  The Company's sales and product development personnel
              work directly with the engineering and styling departments of the
              automotive original equipment manufacturers and suppliers in the
              engineering and development of its various products.

                      DISTRIBUTION.  The Company utilizes, as a distribution
              center for some of its automotive finished products,
              approximately 138,000 square feet of a 283,000 square foot public
              warehouse which it operates in Dearborn, Michigan.  The balance
              of the warehouse space is allocated to commercial customers' use.
              The Company also distributes automotive finished products from a
              leased warehouse in Charlotte, North Carolina, central to the
              Company's Southern plants.

                      Most of the Company's nondomestic customers are supplied
              directly by foreign manufacturing plants of subsidiaries of the
              Company.

                      COMPETITION.  Each aspect of the Company's business in
              automotive products is highly competitive.  No single firm
              competes with the Company in all aspects of this business.  The
              Company's competitive position depends upon its ability to offer
              engineering and design capabilities and to manufacture products
              which meet its customers' pricing, quality and delivery
              requirements.  The Company has historically met the customers'
              requirements.

              Other
              -----

                      The Company, through its subsidiary, Holm Industries,
              Inc., manufactures rubber and plastic trim seals for the
              automotive replacement, construction and marine industries and a
              variety of plastic and magnetic parts for original equipment
              appliance manufacturers and residential and commercial exterior
              door and window manufacturers.  These products are manufactured
              with some of the raw materials similar to those used in the
              products manufactured by the Transportation Equipment and Tread
              Rubber Segments.  See "Raw Materials" for a discussion of
              suppliers and available supplies.  Distribution of these products
              are through both internal sales personnel and manufacturing
              representatives.  These products are sold to many customers, and
              market share information is not available for all of the products
              which Holm manufactures.  For plastic and magnetic seals, Holm is
              the largest supplier to the United States refrigeration and
              freezer appliance market.

                      In July 1992, Holm acquired the assets of Jarrow
              Products, a small manufacturer of commercial refrigeration
              gaskets and exterior door weatherstrip.

              Joint Venture
              -------------

                      The Company also manufactures vehicle body and door
              sealing systems for sale to North American automotive original
              equipment manufacturers and Japanese transplants, including
              Honda, Ford Motor Company and Automotive Alliance International
              (formerly Mazda), through its North American joint venture,

              Nishikawa Standard Company (NISCO), a general partnership owned
              50% by the Company and 50% by Nishikawa Rubber Company
              (Nishikawa) of Hiroshima, Japan.  Manufacturing operations are
              conducted at plants located in Bremen and Topeka, Indiana.  In
              December 1992, the Company increased its ownership in NISCO to
              50% from 40% by making additional capital contributions and by
              purchasing partnership units from Nishikawa.  The chief operating
              officer of the Company is the chief executive officer of NISCO
              and chairman of its Policy Committee.

              TREAD RUBBER SEGMENT

                      PRODUCTS.  The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Oliver
              Rubber Company ("Oliver"), manufactures and markets precure and
              mold cure tread rubber, bonding gum, cement, repair materials and
              equipment for the tire retreading industry.

                      Oliver also supplies custom mixed rubber to the Company
              for use in automotive original equipment products and to NISCO
              for the manufacture of door seals for automotive original
              equipment.  Oliver also custom mixes rubber compounds for
              selected customers throughout the United States.

                      Precure tread rubber is shipped to a retreader partially
              cured and with a specially designed tread imprinted.  The
              retreader cements the precure tread to a tire casing using heat
              and pressure to complete a permanent bond.

                      Mold cure tread rubber is applied by a retread dealer to
              the tire casing in a pressure mold which cures the rubber and at
              the same time imprints into it the tread design.

                      Based on industry statistics in 1994, precure tread
              rubber represents approximately 75% of the tread rubber used by
              the retreading industry and mold cure represents 25%.  Oliver
              supplies both precure and mold cure tread rubber.

                      MARKETS.  Oliver serves the trucking industry in North
              America and Europe through its licensed dealer network for
              precure retreading and through dealers who sell mold cure rubber.
              Oliver also serves markets in other areas of the world, such as
              India, through license arrangements and export sales.  Truck
              mileage, and therefore demand for tread rubber, correlate with
              general economic conditions of the market served.

                      Oliver also supplies mold cure tread rubber for off-the-
              road (OTR) construction equipment.

                      DISTRIBUTION.  In North America, tread rubber products
              are marketed by Oliver's sales force to retread dealers, some of
              which are licensed by Oliver.  Licensed dealers use Oliver's
              patented precure system and market tread rubber under the name of
              Tuff-Cure.

                      COMPETITION.  The tread rubber industry is very
              competitive with more than ten suppliers, of which three are
              significant.  Competition is based upon the price and quality of
              the products supplied.  While exact market share information is
              not available, it is estimated that based on pounds shipped, the
              largest supplier of precure tread rubber is Bandag, Incorporated
              ("Bandag").  Oliver, unlike Bandag, sells in North America, both
              precure and mold cure tread rubber, and management believes it is
              the largest supplier of mold cure rubber and it is the second
              largest supplier of tread rubber in 1994.

              Other
              -----
                      In 1992, Oliver acquired the assets of Salisbury 
              Machine, a manufacturer of equipment used in retreading tires.

              DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

                      In fiscal 1991, the Company discontinued the manufacture
              of rubberized track for military vehicles.  As a result, the
              Company significantly curtailed operations at its Port Clinton
              Division and recorded a provision of $30,000,000 for estimated
              ongoing losses and estimated costs associated with closure and/or
              sale of the division.  During fiscal 1992, the Company completed
              or subcontracted its contractual commitments, and losses incurred
              were charged to the reserve.  In 1993, the Company announced the
              complete closure of the Port Clinton Division, which had been
              involved in rubber mixing for other Company facilities following
              its termination of the military business.  Assets related to the
              military operations have been sold, transferred to other Company
              facilities or disposed.  The accumulated postretirement benefits
              of the Port Clinton employees had been recognized in the
              provision for discontinued operations of $30,000,000 and has now
              been reclassified to accrued postretirement benefits.  The
              remaining balance of the reserve represents reserves for building
              and site work and closure costs.

              RAW MATERIALS

                      The principal materials used by the Company and its
              subsidiaries in its Transportation Equipment and Tread Rubber
              Segments are synthetic rubber and rubber chemicals.  In addition,
              other significant materials used by the Company in its
              Transportation Equipment Segment are plastic resins, woven
              fabrics, flock fibers, coil steel, aluminum and adhesives.  The
              majority of these materials are purchased on the open market from
              domestic suppliers.

                      The Company believes that it has adequate supplies of raw
              materials available from reliable sources for the levels of
              production presently anticipated.

              ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT

                      Product development is an essential part of the market
              strength of the Company and its automotive subsidiaries.  The
              Company's sales and product development personnel work directly
              with the engineering and styling departments of its major
              customers in the engineering and development of new products.  In
              recent years, the Company's involvement with its automotive
              customers has begun at the earlier model design stage with the
              Company assuming an increasing share of engineering and design
              capability and responsibility.  The Company's main sales and
              product development group is located in Dearborn, Michigan, close
              to the purchasing and engineering groups of its customers.  The
              Company also has significant product development facilities at
              Stratford, Ontario, Huntingdon, England and Courbevoie, France.

                      As of August 15, 1994, 231 engineers and technicians were
              engaged in development and engineering activities.  The Company
              spent approximately $31,538,000 in 1994, $22,003,000 in 1993 and
              $17,153,000 in 1992 on product engineering and development, of
              which $2,688,000 in 1994, $1,032,000 in 1993 and $3,534,000 in
              1992 were customer-reimbursed.

                      In 1994, the product engineering and development
              expenditures, net of customer reimbursement, were 3.6% of
              Transportation Equipment sales.  In 1993 and 1992, the comparable
              percentages were 3% and 2.3%, respectively.  The percentage of
              product engineering and development expenditures to Tread Rubber
              Segment sales for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were 1.2%, 1.3% and .9%,
              respectively.

              PATENTS AND LICENSES

                      The Company holds numerous patents covering various
              manufacturing processes and products of the Transportation
              Equipment Segment and several patents relating to application
              processes used by its tread rubber customers.  The Company has
              licensed certain of the patents.  The Company has a license
              agreement with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and
              engineering services on certain products sold by


                                      -5-
<PAGE>   6
              the Company.  While the Company considers some of its patents and
              licenses to be important in certain aspects of its business, the
              Company does not believe that the loss or expiration of any
              particular patent or license would have an adverse effect on
              either segment of its business.  The Company actively pursues the
              application for patents on new products and processes.

              EMPLOYEES

                      As of June 30, 1994, the Company employed approximately
              9,480 persons, of whom approximately 6,273 were hourly employees.
              Employee relations at the Company's plants generally have been
              good.

              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

                      The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance
              with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge
              of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
              protection of the environment.  The Company maintains personnel
              whose function is to monitor compliance with environmental
              protection regulations.

                      At the Company's Gaylord, Michigan plant, the Company is
              correcting the condition of groundwater located under its plant
              by injecting such water to underground depths well below and
              separate from the drinking water aquifer.  All corrective
              activities are fully permitted by the Michigan Department of
              Natural Resources and the United States Environmental Protection
              Agency.  The cost of installation and operation are not material
              to the Company's financial position.

                      The Company has been previously designated as a
              potentially responsible party in connection with several disposal
              sites.  Settlements with payment of an immaterial amount or no
              amount at all have been obtained for all sites, except a site
              located in Jamestown, North Carolina.  The Company believes that
              it was an insignificant contributor at this site and that this
              matter will be resolved without a material adverse affect to the
              Company's financial position.

                      The Company has been notified that the property occupied
              by its Schenectady, New York plant is being investigated due to
              allegations concerning possible contamination resulting from the
              operations of the previous property owner.  No determination of
              liability to the Company, if any, can be made at this time.

              FOREIGN OPERATIONS

                      The Company owns all of the outstanding shares of
              Standard Products (Canada) Limited, a Canadian corporation which
              is engaged primarily in the manufacture of parts and accessories
              for United States and Canadian automotive original equipment
              manufacturers and for the automotive replacement parts market and
              the manufacture of tread rubber for the tire retreading industry.

                      The Company owns all of the outstanding shares (except
              for qualifying shares held by nominees) of Standard Products
              Limited, an English corporation which is engaged primarily in the
              manufacture of parts and accessories for the North American,
              United Kingdom and European automotive original equipment
              manufacturers and for the automotive replacement parts market.

                      The Company owns all of the outstanding shares (except
              for qualifying shares held by nominees) of Oliver Europa, an
              English corporation engaged primarily in the manufacture and
              distribution of tread rubber and rubber and related products in
              Europe.

                      In January 1993, the Company acquired all of the issued
              and outstanding shares of capital stock of Standard Products
              Industriel (SPI), a corporation organized under French law, and
              all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
              SPI's affiliated companies:  Societe Lillebonnaise de
              Caoutchoucs, Standard Products Atlantic and Central Auto, each of
              which is a corporation organized under French law, Standard
              Products Industriel SA, a corporation organized under Swiss law,
              Rubber Industrial Holding Company, a Delaware corporation, "5"
              Rubber Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation and La Riviere
              Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (SPI and such affiliated
              companies collectively, the "SPI Group").  The SPI Group is
              engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing
              and distributing automotive window weatherstrips, glass
              weatherstrips, vehicle body and door seals and glass
              encapsulation products to French, other European and North
              American auto manufacturers.  The SPI Group's customers include,
              among others, PSA (Peugeot/Citroen), Renault, Fiat, Volvo,
              Chrysler Corporation, General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen and
              Saab.  SPI's European customer base complements the customer base
              of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom.  The SPI Group
              has an experienced management team and expertise in the technical
              design and engineering of automotive sealing products and
              systems.  Similar to the Company, SPI's design personnel work
              closely with the engineering and styling departments of its
              customers.

                      The Company also has minority equity interests in and
              licensing arrangements with firms in Australia, Brazil, Japan,
              Korea, India and other countries throughout the world.

                      The Company's United States export sales in the aggregate
              for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 and June
              28, 1992, were $41,472,000, $42,800,000 and $37,400,000,
              respectively, of which a substantial portion is represented by
              sales to automotive original equipment manufacturers in Canada.

                      The Company's experience has been that its significant
              foreign businesses in Canada and Western Europe do not present
              materially different risks or problems from those encountered in
              its United States markets.  The risks of the Company, Standard
              Products (Canada) Limited, Standard Products Limited and Standard
              Products Industriel involve meeting the customers' expectations
              as to the timely delivery of parts which meet their
              specifications.  The automotive business is directly affected by
              the annual car production of original equipment manufacturers.
              Standard Products (Canada) Limited, Standard Products Limited,
              and Standard Products Industriel participate in the risk of
              varying car builds similar to any of the Company's other
              automotive plants which supply domestic assembly plants.

                 (1)      Facilities used in the Tread Rubber Segment.

                 (2)      These facilities are encumbered by either capital
                          lease or mortgage agreements which provide for
                          payments sufficient to pay principal of and interest
                          on first mortgage industrial revenue bonds issued for
                          the purchase of the plants and equipment.  These
                          agreements have been capitalized for financial
                          statement purposes.

                 (3)      Leased from others.  The leases are short to medium

                          renew for additional periods.  Rental rates are
                          competitive for the market in which the property is
                          located.  The Company believes that all of these
                          leased facilities could be replaced for comparable
                          terms.

                 25% of the Company's net assets at June 30, 1994.

                      ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES
                      ------------------------------------

To: The Standard Products Company

         We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated financial statements included in The Standard
Products Company and Subsidiary Companies 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders
incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon
dated August 2, 1994.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on those statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed in the index of
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management and are
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and are not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole.

                 (10%) of stockholders' equity at any one time outstanding, or

         10.     Subsection 5.05(c) (captioned "INTEREST COVERAGE") is hereby
         amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                 5.05(c)   INTEREST COVERAGE -- If the Borrower suffers or

         12.     Section 1.01 (captioned "CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS") is hereby

                 including, without limitation, the Rating Agency; provided,
                 however, that no such security shall mature more than one (1)
                 year after the date when made.
<PAGE>   4
                 "ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY" means the currency of Canada, France,
                 or England, as the case may be.

         14.     Upon the execution and delivery of this Amendment, the
         Borrower will not be in default under the Agreement as so
         Amended.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, borrowers, banks and Agent have executed this
Agreement of Amendment at the time and place first above mentioned.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


o        Sales for fiscal 1994 increased 14% as we realized the full benefit of
         the 1993 acquisition of Standard Products Industriel.  Earnings were
         flat with comparable 1993 results due to the transition to new model
         launches and the balancing out of certain car and light truck models.

o        We launched 18 new programs worldwide, including the Mustang, Neon and
         Windstar in North America, and we are in the midst of the Lumina
         launch.  As a result of the transition to new models and the slow
         acceleration to full production, our total North American automotive
         sales rose only marginally compared with 1993.

o        Our European operations reported higher sales and profits in fiscal
         1994 compared with the prior 12-month period.  We benefited from an
         improving auto market in Europe and our participation on some of the
         most popular models introduced in the last 12 months.

o        We have completed a private placement of $75 million of 6.55% Senior
         Notes to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  Proceeds from the
         placement were used to refinance a portion of existing debt, extending
         maturities and reducing rates.

o        In the fourth quarter, we increased the regular dividend by 6.25% to
         17 cents a share.  The payment brings the total dividends for fiscal
         1994 to 65 cents a share, an increase of 19.5% compared with the
         previous fiscal year.

(Across pages 2 and 3 reads "1994 continued a period of major business
expansion" in large print.)

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:

Fiscal 1994 continued a period of major business expansion for The Standard
Products Co.  We successfully integrated our acquisition of Standard Products
Industriel (SPI), achieving a broader global presence.  Concurrently, we met
the challenge of launching 18 new programs worldwide, part of a continuing
expansion that will almost double the size of the Company between 1991 and
1996.  In delivering on these programs, we made important progress in
streamlining the business and improving operations, as we gear up for the even
more intensive schedule of new programs ahead.

Sales in fiscal 1994 increased 14% to $872,367,000 compared with $763,796,000
the prior year.  Net income for the year was $33,032,000, equal to $1.99 per
share on 16,627,000 shares outstanding.  That compares with income before
nonrecurring items of $33,423,000, or $2.21 per share last year, on 15,114,000
shares outstanding.  Sales included $161,825,000 from SPI and 5 Rubber
Corporation compared with a contribution to sales of $46,411,000 in fiscal
1993, which covered only four months of the year.  A large part of 5 Rubber's
1994 contribution was new business from the launch of Chrysler's Neon four-door
model.

North American automotive operations recorded fiscal 1994 sales of $461,794,000
compared with $457,821,000 last year.  Sales for 1994 included $32,935,000 from
5 Rubber and its launch of the four-door Neon.  The continued acceleration of
successful launches of the Ford Mustang and Ford Windstar minivan also
contributed to revenues during the year.  These gains, however, were offset by
a drop in the build of certain car and light truck models carrying Standard
Products' parts.  Also, revenues from the parts supplied for the Chevrolet
Lumina were off $26,300,000 compared with the prior year due to a customer
delay in the ramp up of the new model.  General Motors is now forecasting that
the Lumina will reach full production by the end of September 1994.  As a
result of these factors, profits from North American automotive operations were
down for the year.

Our European operations, Standard Products Limited (SPL) in the United Kingdom
and SPI in France, reported higher volumes and improved profits in fiscal 1994
compared with the prior 12-month period.  We benefited from an improving
European auto market and our participation on some of the most popular models
introduced in the last 12 months.

We brought our new worldwide engineering and development capabilities to bear
in the European market last year.  A European team lead by SPL, with support
from SPI, our North American operations and our joint-venture partner Nishikawa
Rubber, took on an assignment from Ford of Europe to redesign the sealing
system of the European Escort.  Our redesign reached "best in class"
performance levels, and as a result, SPL and SPI were awarded a portion of the
Escort business.  This project should have positive long-term implications with
our key customers in Germany.

Looking ahead, both SPI and SPL have solid schedules of new business for the
coming year, and their key models are selling well.  They also stand to gain
from an improving European auto market.

NISCO, our 50%-owned joint venture with Nishikawa Rubber Company of Japan, was
profitable in fiscal 1994.  This marked NISCO's first full year of
profitability after seven years of investment.  Our share of NISCO's profits is
50%, but NISCO's sales are not consolidated in the Standard Products income
statement.

Sales at our Oliver Rubber Company subsidiary were $124,169,000, marginally
higher than last year.  Earnings, however, were off substantially due to higher
manufacturing costs, more sales of lower-margin products and problems at its
Oliver Europa operation based in the United Kingdom.  To create greater synergy
between Oliver and our automotive business, we are coordinating company-wide
rubber mixing operations and integrating Oliver more fully into the Standard
Products organization.  Oliver is also in the process of relocating its
headquarters from Oakland, California, to Athens, Georgia.  The move will bring
Oliver's management and customer service functions closer to the majority of
the Company's retread customers and to its largest precure production
facilities.

Sales at Holm Industries rose 10% to $87,044,000, while profits increased by a
comparable percentage.  The improvement was due to increased volume from Holm's
primary customers and growth at Jarrow Products, which Holm acquired in 1992.

<PAGE>   5
In May 1994, we announced the transfer of our corporate finance and human
resources departments from Cleveland, Ohio, to our Dearborn, Michigan, office.
The move, to be completed by April 1995, will consolidate and integrate our
corporate operations functions and bring all our operating executives nearer to
our major customers.

Directors of the Company voted in June 1994 to increase the regular quarterly
dividend by 6.25% to 17 cents a share, payable July 25, 1994.  The payment
brings the total dividends for fiscal 1994 to 65 cents a share, an increase of
19.5% compared with the previous fiscal year.  Earlier in the year, we
completed the placement of $75 million of 6.55% Senior Notes, due December 16,
2003, to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with principal payments to begin
in December 1998.  Proceeds from the placement have been used to refinance a
portion of existing debt under our revolving credit agreement.

Fiscal 1995 will be another challenging transition year for us.  We will launch
major new programs, such as the Lumina, the European Ford Escort, the Chrysler
Cirrus/Stratus, the Ford Taurus/Sable, the new Chrysler NS minivan and many
other models.  At the same time, we continue to streamline the Company with
plant adjustments, personnel transfers, productivity improvements and cost
reduction programs.  We see the possibility that some delays at the customer
level will affect results in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.  All in all,
this is an exciting time.  With new business coming in at a rapid pace and
opportunities developing all over the world, we expect continuing improvement
as the year progresses and into fiscal 1996.

                             NEW GLOBAL RESOURCES
                             NEW GLOBAL PROGRAMS

In the next 21 months, Standard Products plants will produce sealing and
trimming systems for a number of major new auto models for North American,
European and Japanese manufacturers.  Together with other smaller programs,
including the Lumina but not including NISCO, these new contracts represent
some $350 million in annual new business, replacing $105 million in existing
volume.

<PAGE>   7
                               PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

New model programs represent the greatest source of sales growth at Standard
Products but also the greatest challenge.  The demands have expanded in the
1990's, as the U.S. auto industry has shortened the design-to-production cycle
time and sought to shift much of the responsibility for engineering, testing
and systems-integration to the suppliers.  In 1991, anticipating the heavy
schedule of launches, we developed our Program Management system.  More than
two years in advance of the launch date, a dedicated team is created and its
executive manager given full responsibility and authority to get the job done.
While no amount of planning can prevent all disruptions, the Program Management
approach clearly proved its worth this past year in three major launches - the
Mustang, Neon and Windstar.  The Neon launch in particular highlighted our
global capabilities.  The sealing system for the Neon was designed by SPI in
France for production in the U.S.  With the help of a team of our engineers and
managers from France, the U.K., the U.S. and Canada, we overcame the challenge
of a new plant, workforce, equipment and production methods to meet Chrysler's
accelerated production schedule.

                                 CHRYSLER NEON


From the new 5 Rubber plant in Griffin, Georgia, we are producing channels,
weatherstripping and door seals for Chrysler's new four-door Neon.  Griffin
launches the two-door Neon this fall, and is installing manufacturing equipment
in preparation for the introduction of Chrysler's NS minivan later in the
fiscal year.

                              ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

Worldwide leadership in rubber and plastic laminated extrusion technology is
the foundation of Standard Products' business and essential to the Company's
long-term success.  In support of this position, we have established design and
development centers in the U.S., Canada, England and France, and we enjoy a
link to Asia through our longstanding joint venture with Nishikawa Rubber of
Japan.  To coordinate this transcontinental expertise, the Company last year
named Gerard H. Mesnel, an experienced European automotive industry executive,
to the new position of executive vice president, advanced technology,
worldwide.  Advanced technology and superior design and engineering services
have enabled us to win a growing share of new programs and increase our content
per car.  In Europe, our U.K. subsidiary was awarded a major contract from Ford
of Germany after we redesigned the sealing system of the European Escort to
"best in class" performance levels.  Demonstrating our technology leadership in
laminated plastic extrusion, we have developed new, more efficient processes
for making extruded bodyside moldings for the Ford Mustang and Chrysler
Cirrus/Dodge Stratus.

<PAGE>   10
                                  FORD MUSTANG


The sealing and trimming systems on the new Ford Mustang include some 20
different parts manufactured by eight different Standard Products and NISCO
plants.  NISCO's preeminence in the design and engineering of sponge rubber
dynamic door seals has made it a preferred supplier to Ford as well as the U.S.
plants owned by Honda, Toyota and other Japanese OEMs.

<PAGE>   11
                             CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT


As important as it is, capital investment alone will not provide the ongoing
breakthroughs in technology and efficiency that the marketplace demands.  For
this reason, we place great emphasis on the concepts of employee involvement
and kaizen, or continuous improvement.  These programs have been adopted in our
operations worldwide.  They are paying off in higher quality and in dramatic
reductions in work-in-process inventories, manufacturing space and lead times.
Our ability to achieve continuous improvements, combined with the synergy of
our worldwide resources, is becoming a key competitive advantage for our
future.  One area where we continue to focus more attention is purchasing and
materials management.  By marshaling our corporate-wide purchasing power, we
hope to take advantage of the fact that we are among the largest buyers in the
world of certain materials and equipment.  Providing additional leverage is our
increasingly sophisticated rubber-manufacturing capability.  We are making more
of our own rubber, and by coordinating all our rubber-mixing operations -
retread and automotive - we expect to achieve further improvements in this
area.

<PAGE>   12
                                CHEVROLET LUMINA


The new Chevrolet Lumina features bodyside moldings, rubber glass-run channels
and weatherstripping supplied by Standard Products plants in Canada and the
United States.  Always focused on continuous improvement, we developed a
one-piece integrated glass-run channel assembly for the Lumina that had
previously required five separate components.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW

The Company's Transportation Equipment Segment is engaged in the production of
a variety of extruded and molded rubber and plastic products for the
automotive, construction and marine industries and plastic and magnetic parts
for the appliance and building products industries.  Operations of the
Transportation Equipment Segment are conducted in Canada, Europe and the United
States, serving the automotive industry in each of these geographic areas.

The Tread Rubber Segment manufactures and distributes precure and mold cure
tread rubber, bonding gum, repair materials, retread tire molds and equipment
for the tire retreading industry.  Operations are conducted in North America,
Europe and other countries by the Company's subsidiary, Oliver Rubber Company.
The primary market for tread rubber is the over-the-road trucking industry.  In
addition, this segment provides tread rubber for off-the-road construction
equipment and custom mixes rubber for both internal and external customers.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales for fiscal 1994 increased $108,571,000, or 14.2%, to $872,367,000.  Net
income was $33,032,000, or $1.99 a share, compared to income before an
accounting change and an extraordinary item in 1993 of $33,423,000, or $2.21 a
share.  In 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 106, and the cumulative effect of the change to this accounting
principle was $8,301,000, net of tax.  The Company also prepaid a portion of
its Senior Notes, incurring a prepayment charge of $4,128,000, or $2,559,000
after tax.  Net income, therefore, was $22,563,000, or $1.49 a share.

SALES PERFORMANCE - 1994 AND 1993

Sales of the Transportation Equipment Segment for fiscal 1994 amounted to
$753,764,000, an increase of $103,709,000, or 16%, over fiscal 1993.  Fiscal
year 1994 includes a full year effect of the Company's acquisition in fiscal
1993 of Standard Products Industriel (SPI) and its subsidiary in the United
States, 5 Rubber Corporation.  In 1993, sales of SPI and 5 Rubber Corporation
since the date of acquisition were $46,411,000.  In 1994, full year sales of
SPI and 5 Rubber Corporation were $161,825,000.

In North America, sales, including 5 Rubber Corporation, amounted to
$461,794,000, an increase of $3,973,000 over the previous year.  A full year of
sales of 5 Rubber Corporation combined with the launch of 5 Rubber
Corporation's new products on the Chrysler Neon resulted in increased sales of
$26,812,000.  The sales of parts for the Neon amounted to $20,672,000.
Offsetting these gains were sales declines in Canada.  General Motors ceased
production of the former Lumina model in November 1993 to begin conversion of
plant facilities for the new Lumina/Monte Carlo models.  Sales volumes of the
Company's Canadian subsidiary, therefore, declined by a net $11,033,000 with
the decline of $26,300,000 related to the Lumina offset partially by other new
production.  In addition, over the course of fiscal 1994, the rate of exchange
of the U.S./Canadian dollar declined, and the effect of the decline was to
reduce sales by $10,600,000.  For fiscal 1994, sales of U.S.  operations other
than 5 Rubber Corporation declined $1,200,000, and this resulted from model
changeovers and declines in units of production of some models which are
assembled with parts manufactured by the Company.  Car and light truck build
advanced 10.2% over the build of fiscal 1993.  The decline in the Lumina build,
as well as several other models, caused the Company's sales to lag behind the
pace of the North American production of fiscal 1994.

Sales of the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary, Standard Products Limited
(SPL), increased $2,834,000 to $75,706,000.  New business with European
automotive manufacturers, including Saab, Volkswagen and Japanese transplant
Toyota, and increased volumes of production resulted in sales increases of
$8,498,000.  These gains were offset by a decline in the rate of exchange of
the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar.

SPI recorded full year sales of $128,890,000 compared to fiscal 1993's short
period of $40,288,000.  A sales comparison for a full twelve month period of
fiscal 1993 reveals year-to-year improvement of 8.6%.  SPI has benefited from
new business and rising production volumes realized during the period of
economic recovery in Europe, which became evident in the fourth quarter.

<PAGE>   14
Holm Industries, Inc., the Company's subsidiary that supplies the appliance and
building products industries, recorded sales increases of $7,890,000, or 10%,
to $87,044,000.  Holm Industries' sales increases were attributable to
increased demand in the residential and commercial appliance market and the
broadening of its product line in building products.

In the Tread Rubber Segment, sales in fiscal 1994 were $124,169,000, including
intersegment sales of $5,566,000.  Sales increased 5.9%, or $6,945,000.
Increased sales were realized in this segment's mold cure and mixed rubber
products, while precure sales were approximately even with a year ago.  Prices
were generally stable in 1994 compared to 1993.

SALES PERFORMANCE - 1993 AND 1992

In the Transportation Equipment Segment, sales were $650,055,000 in fiscal 1993
compared to $551,768,000 in 1992.  The increase of 18%, or $98,287,000,
included $46,411,000 related to the acquisition of SPI and $11,773,000 related
to the acquisition of Jarrow Products.  Global automotive sales were
$570,981,000 in 1993 compared to $490,589,000 in 1992.  In North America, sales
were $457,821,000, an increase of $46,000,000, or 11%.  The SPI subsidiary in
North America represented $6,123,000 of the 1993 sales gain.  In addition, the
increase in the Company's sales due to increased 1993 car and light truck
production was $50,285,000, or 12%.  Offsetting these increases was the 7%
decline in the rate of exchange of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar,
resulting in a reduction of sales of $10,407,000.  For 1993, the production of
cars and light trucks advanced 9.4% over 1992 with light truck production ahead
by 14.7% and car production ahead by 5.9%.

In the United Kingdom, sales of the Company's subsidiary, SPL, declined by
$5,897,000 to $72,872,000.  The majority of the decline in sales was related to
the 7% decline in the rate of exchange between British pound sterling and the
U.S. dollar.  Sales volume for the year was even with 1992.  SPL experienced a
variation in the mix of sales as their volume improved in line with
strengthening United Kingdom car sales.  SPL's shipments to North America,
however, declined as the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis production experienced
production interruptions during 1993.

Holm Industries recorded sales of $79,154,000, an increase of $19,155,000 over
1992.  The acquisition of Jarrow Products contributed $11,773,000 of the
increase with the balance due to strengthening appliance sales in 1993.

The Tread Rubber Segment reported sales of $117,224,000 including intersegment
sales of $3,483,000.  These results represent an increase of $9,735,000, or
9.1% over 1992 sales.  Oliver increased sales volume in North America by 7%
with new dealer programs and improved national account sales.

OPERATING EXPENSE ANALYSIS

Consolidated gross margins of 13.7% for fiscal 1994 decreased from 14.2% in
1993 and 14.3% in 1992.  The costs of material, wages and manufacturing
expenses were $724,090,000 in 1994, $634,218,000 in 1993 and $549,164,000 in
1992.  Research, engineering and development expenses were $28,850,000 in
fiscal 1994, an increase of $7,879,000 over 1993's research, engineering and
development expenditures of $20,971,000.  These expenses were $13,619,000 in
1992.  Gross income was $119,427,000 in 1994, $108,607,000 in 1993 and
$94,253,000 in 1992.

Gross income was favorably affected by the inclusion of SPI and 5 Rubber
Corporation for a full year period compared to last year's four month period.
In addition, these locations experienced rising volumes of sales related to
increased production and new model introductions.  SPI also benefited from an
improved European economy.  The incremental gross income from SPI and 5 Rubber
Corporation represented 2.7% of fiscal 1994 sales.  Similarly, SPL benefited
from its new business and the increasing volumes of its European car base,
contributing .5% of 1994 sales to improved gross income.  North American
automotive operations adversely affected gross income.  Canadian operations
experienced a significant decline in sales with the conversion of General
Motors assembly plants to the new Lumina/Monte Carlo models.  In addition, the
introduction of the new models was later than originally expected.  United
States operations also were down from the preceding year as production volumes
were off for several car models which use the Company's parts.  Further, the
U.S. plants began preparing for upcoming new product introductions.  North
American operations adversely affected gross income by .8% of fiscal 1994
sales.  The increase in research, engineering and development expenditures
included $5,067,000 of incremental expenses associated with the acquisition of
SPI.  These expenses and the preparation for new model introductions noted
previously are expected to continue at high levels and without immediate
revenue contribution.  Holm Industries' profitability for the year was ahead of
fiscal 1993 on sales volume increases.

Margins in the Tread Rubber Segment declined.  Profitability was affected by a
shift in sales mix to lower margin products.  In addition, two plants
experienced problems in the introduction of new manufacturing processes.  The
Tread Rubber Segment decline represented .4% of fiscal 1994 sales.

<PAGE>   15
In fiscal 1993, sales volume increases were realized in the automotive and
appliance units of the Transportation Equipment Segment and in the Tread Rubber
Segment.  The increases resulted from the stronger North American car build,
improved level of home appliance sales and the gradual improvement in business
conditions which had begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992.  The effect of
volume increases on profitability represented 1.6% of fiscal 1993 sales.
Incremental sales resulting from the Company's SPI acquisition and from Holm
Industries' acquisition of Jarrow Products produced incremental gross profits
as well and amounted to 1.4% of sales.  Gross income was affected by the
increase in corporate research, engineering and development expenses,
representing 1% of 1993 sales.  This increase included the incremental effect
of the SPI acquisition.  Gross income was also adversely affected by increased
material costs representing .2% of 1993 sales.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12,443,000 to
$62,211,000 in fiscal 1994.  SPI and 5 Rubber Corporation were responsible for
$8,531,000 of the increase.  In addition, the Company recorded reserves for the
relocation of two administrative areas, the corporate finance and human
resources areas, from Cleveland, Ohio to the Dearborn, Michigan location and
the Oliver's Oakland, California headquarters to Athens, Georgia.  Each
relocation positions corporate activities nearer to customer bases and
consolidates distant departments.  The accrual amounting to $2,424,000 consists
of relocation, severance and other employee related costs.  Approximately 65
employees are involved in these moves, which will be completed by April 1995.

The Company also provided a reserve of $2,000,000 related to accounting
irregularities which were discovered in the course of the normal year-end
audit at Oliver Rubber's European subsidiary, Oliver Europa.  The
irregularities involved the propriety of accounts receivable, inventory and
promotional expenses.  The effect of these matters was not material to the
earnings previously reported by the Company, and therefore, a restatement of
quarterly earnings was not necessary.

As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.1%
in fiscal 1994 versus 6.5% in 1993 and 6.4% in 1992.  Without the relocation
provisions and the Oliver Europa reserve, selling, general and administrative
expenses would have been 6.6% of sales.

Interest expense, net in fiscal 1994 was $9,093,000.  Interest expense was
$9,982,000 and interest income was $889,000.  In fiscal 1993, interest expense,
net was $8,214,000 and interest expense was $9,684,000, while interest income
was $1,470,000.  Interest expense increased $298,000 and interest income
declined $581,000.  During a portion of fiscal 1994, the Company incurred
interest expense at a lower short-term rate on a higher level of borrowings
under the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement.  In mid-fiscal 1994, short-term
borrowings were reduced by the proceeds of a new senior note obligation at a
fixed rate of 6.55%, higher than prevailing short-term rates, but less than
previous fixed senior note rates.  The decline in interest income was related
to a lower level of invested funds in fiscal 1994 compared to 1993.

In fiscal 1992, interest expense, net was $13,659,000.  Interest expense that
year was $14,980,000, while interest income was $1,321,000.  In comparison to
fiscal 1993, interest expense declined $5,296,000 and interest income increased
by $149,000.  Expense in 1992 includes a prepayment charge of $2,600,000 paid
to senior note holders in connection with the early repayment of these
obligations.  A similar charge incurred in fiscal 1993 was reported as an
extraordinary item due to its significance.  The further reduction of interest
expense in fiscal 1993 compared to 1992 reflects the lower borrowing rates of
medium term Revolving Credit obligations in 1993 compared to the higher rate
obligations of senior notes in the United States and of SPL's borrowings in the
United Kingdom.

Royalty and dividend income were comparable for the periods.  Other, net in
fiscal 1994 represents income of $1,322,000 compared to expense of $1,150,000
in 1993 and $753,000 in 1992.  The Company's share of profitable results of the
Company's joint ventures, including NISCO, accounted for the improvement.

In fiscal 1994, the Company's effective tax rate was 34.2%, an increase over
1993's effective rate of 33.5% but less than 1992's effective rate of 40%.
Over the three year period, the effective rate has declined as a result of tax
credits for research and development available to the Company, primarily in its
overseas locations, and due to improved results at SPL which are without tax
expense as loss carryforwards of prior years are applied.  The rate increased
in 1994, however, as a result of the reserves provided for Oliver Europa which
are not deductible.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

During the three year period ended June 30, 1994, rates of inflation have been
low and operating costs reflect current costs for expenses, inventory and
depreciation.

<PAGE>   16
FINANCIAL CONDITION

At June 30, 1994, capitalization of the Company totaled $378,058,000 with
long-term debt of $135,381,000 and shareholders' equity of $242,677,000.  The
components of total capitalization were 35.8% debt and 64.2% equity.  Working
capital at year end was $87,922,000, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was 1.48 to 1.  Average working capital to support a dollar of
sales was $.10 compared to $.09 a year ago.

Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $58,793,000 for fiscal 1994.
Non-cash charges included therein were $40,495,000 for depreciation and
amortization and $627,000 for foreign exchange variations.  Depreciation and
amortization increased over the prior year reflecting the Company's recent
capital investment and the SPI acquisition.  Investments in 1994 included
$59,120,000 in property, plant and equipment and $1,500,000 invested in NISCO.

During the year, new borrowings amounted to $140,343,000 and included the new
issue of Senior Notes of $75,000,000.  Proceeds of the Senior Notes and other
borrowings were used to repay higher interest rate industrial revenue bonds and
to reduce borrowings under the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement.  Cash and
cash equivalents at year end were nil, a decrease from last year's cash and
cash equivalents of $5,548,000.

Capital expenditures budgeted for fiscal 1995 are $62,000,000.  Cash flow from
operations and borrowing capacity of the Company using the Revolving Credit
Agreement and short-term borrowing commitments are expected to be adequate to
meet operating and capital requirements for fiscal 1995.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Standard Products Company and Subsidiary Companies
June 30, 1994, 1993 and June 28, 1992

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Major intercompany items have been
eliminated.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Short-term investments include bankers acceptances and repurchase agreements at
varying rates of interest and with original maturities less than thirty days.
These investments are carried at cost which approximates market value.  For
purposes of reporting the Company's cash flow, these investments are cash
equivalents.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The financial statements of the Company's Canadian, English and French
subsidiaries have been translated in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 52.  Current rates of exchange are used to translate
the balance sheets of these entities while the average exchange rate of each
fiscal year is used for the translation of income accounts.  The resulting
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of shareholders'
equity.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

For financial reporting purposes, the Company provides for depreciation of
plant and equipment using the straight-line and sum-of-years' digits methods at
annual rates based on the estimated service lives of the property.  Maintenance
and repair expenditures are charged to income as incurred.  Expenditures for
improvements and major renewals are capitalized.  When assets are retired, the
related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and
any gain or loss on the disposition is credited or charged to income.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The majority of
domestic inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and
the remaining inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

The Company's investments in affiliate operations are accounted for by both the
equity and cost methods of accounting.  The cost method is followed in those
situations where the Company's ownership is less than 20% and operations are
conducted by management of the affiliate.  Income is recorded as received.  The
equity method of accounting is followed in those situations of larger ownership
interests but less than 51%, and the Company's results of operations include
those of the affiliate to the extent of its ownership interest.

EXCESS OF COST OVER NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES

The excess cost over the fair value of acquired net assets is amortized on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life but not in excess of 40
years.

INCOME TAXES

In fiscal 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  The effect of adopting SFAS No.
109 was immaterial, and prior years were not restated.

Income tax expense includes United States, foreign and state income taxes,
exclusive of taxes on the undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where it
is the intention of the Company to have those subsidiaries reinvest the income
locally.  For fiscal 1994 and 1993, the Company determined tax expense and
other deferred tax information using the liability method, which recognizes the
differences in financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and
liabilities at tax rates currently in effect.  For 1992, tax expense was based
upon transactions included in determining financial statement income.  Deferred
taxes were provided for differences in the timing of reporting transactions for
tax and financial reporting purposes.  Permanent differences are included in
the calculation of income tax expense currently.

<PAGE>   23
RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company and its subsidiary companies have a number of plans providing
pension, retirement or profit sharing benefits for substantially all employees.
These plans include defined benefit, defined contribution and multi-employer
plans.  For defined benefit plans, those covering salaried employees provide
pension benefits based upon the individual employee's average compensation over
the last five years, while hourly plans provide benefits of stated amounts for
each year of service.  The Company's policy is to fund the pension costs of the
defined benefit plans in accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The defined contribution and multi-employer plans are funded as accrued, and
the accrual is based upon hourly rates or a percentage of the unit's
performance.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

The Company provides postretirement health and life insurance benefits for
retired salaried and certain retired hourly employees.  Benefits provided under
various plans, individually arranged by business unit, include health and life
insurance.  The plans generally provide for a means to limit the cost of the
plans to the Company through cost sharing or spending limitations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
Employers' Accounting For Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,
retroactive to the beginning of fiscal 1993.  As a result, the previously
reported quarterly results of operations were restated to reflect adoption of
the standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year and the recognition of the
expense of these plans on the accrual basis.  The accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation was recorded as a charge to earnings in 1993.  In 1992, the
expense of these plans was recognized as claims were paid.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign
currency transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying
transaction.  The Company does not engage in speculation and does not hedge
foreign currency positions which are not related to specific transactions.
Gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts generally offset losses and
gains of the transactions being hedged, resulting in protection from the risks
of foreign exchange movement for those transactions and avoiding losses
affecting results of operations.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits.  The standard becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1993 with earlier adoption permitted.  For the Company, adoption
is required for fiscal 1995.  The Company's accounting method for
postemployment benefits has effectively complied with the provisions of SFAS
No. 112.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to their 1994
presentation in the financial statements.

2.  ACQUISITIONS

In January 1993, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of Standard Products Industriel (SPI), a French Company, and
its subsidiary companies.  SPI designs, develops and manufactures window and
glass weatherstrips, vehicle body and door seals and glass encapsulation
products for French, other European and North American auto manufacturers.

The cost of the acquisition was approximately $125,500,000.  The acquisition
has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and the
financial statements of the Company include the acquired assets, assumed
liabilities and results of operations of SPI since the date of acquisition.
Valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 resulted in goodwill and other
assets of approximately $54,000,000.

In 1993, incremental revenues related to SPI since the date of acquisition
amounted to $46,411,000.  Results of operations, including the effects of
purchase valuations, reduced earnings per share by $.06.  If the acquisition of
SPI had been reflected in the consolidated results of operations from the
beginning of the 1993 fiscal year, sales would have been $846,015,000, and
income before extraordinary items and changes in accounting principles would
have been $34,024,000, or $2.24 per share.  For 1992, pro forma sales would
have been $779,000,000, and pro forma income before extraordinary items and
changes in accounting principles would have been $25,600,000, or $1.98 per
share.  All pro forma amounts are unaudited.

<PAGE>   24
In July 1992, the Company's subsidiary, Holm Industries, Inc., acquired the
assets of Jarrow Products, Inc., a manufacturer of commercial refrigeration
gaskets and exterior door weatherstrip.  The purchase price of $7,000,000
equalled the fair value of assets acquired.  The financial statements of the
Company include the results of Jarrow since August 1, 1992.  The pro forma
effect of the Jarrow acquisition was not material.

In fiscal 1993, the Company increased its ownership in NISCO, to 50% from 40%
by making additional capital contributions and by purchasing partnership units
from its joint venture partner, Nishikawa Rubber Company.  The additional
investment in NISCO was $8,700,000.  In fiscal 1994, the Company invested
$1,500,000 in its joint venture, Nishikawa Standard Company (NISCO).  The
Company's investment in NISCO at June 30, 1994 was $15,700,000.  In 1994, the
Company's share of NISCO's operating income was $1,603,000, compared to
$363,000 of losses in 1993.  The NISCO investment is reported in Other Assets
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and the operating results are
reported in Other, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.
Under the terms of NISCO's revolving credit and term loan facility, the joint
venture partners are required to guarantee 50% of NISCO's borrowings.  The
Company's share of the guarantee at year end was $7,500,000.

3.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The Company previously closed its Port Clinton Division, which had been
dedicated primarily to the Company's former military business.  Reserves were
provided for the costs associated with the discontinuance.  At June 30, 1994,
the remaining balance of the reserve of $3,975,000, which is included in
Accrued Expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, is for
building and site work and closure costs.

4.  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt at June 30, 1994 and 1993 consisted of the following:

                               $135,381    $115,607

</TABLE>

At June 30, 1994, Senior Notes outstanding of $100,000,000 include two issues,
$75,000,000 and $25,000,000.  The $75,000,000 Senior Notes, placed directly
with three affiliated insurance companies, are unsecured and accrue interest at
6.55%.  Interest payments are payable semi-annually, and annual principal
payments of $12,500,000 begin in December 1998 through December 2002, with the
balance due on maturity in December 2003.

Coinciding with the issuance of the $75,000,000 fixed rate Senior Notes, the
Company entered into a currency and interest rate swap transaction to establish
fixed interest rates on intercompany borrowings of its French subsidiary.  The
nominal amount is 150,000,000 FF and the term extends to November 2000.

The $25,000,000 Senior Notes are also unsecured notes placed directly with the
holders.  The interest rate is 9.81%, interest is paid semiannually and the
notes are payable July 1, 1999.

Each of the Senior Note agreements require the Company to maintain certain
financial covenants as to net worth, leverage and working capital.

The Revolving Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) represents borrowings from a
group of banks that have committed to make available for borrowing up to
$125,000,000 until January 1997 with provisions for extending the agreement
beyond that date upon satisfaction of certain requirements.  The Company has
the right to convert up to $50,000,000 of revolving loans into a five-year term
loan with quarterly repayments thereafter.  The loans may be denominated in
either U.S. dollars or certain other currencies based upon Eurodollar interest
rates or the agent bank's base rate.  At June 30, 1994, borrowings under the
Credit Agreement bear interest at 5.0%.  A commitment fee of .25% is due on the
unused portion of the agreement.  The terms of the Credit Agreement also
require the Company to maintain certain financial covenants as to net worth,
leverage and working capital.

The maturities of long-term debt for the five years subsequent to June 30, 1994
are $1,690,000 in 1995, $1,594,000 in 1996, $31,466,000 in 1997, $1,177,000 in
1998 and $13,613,000 in 1999.

<PAGE>   25
Under the most restrictive covenants of the Company's various loan agreements,
principally the Credit Agreement, $63,929,000 of retained earnings were not
restricted at June 30, 1994 for the payment of dividends, and the ratio of
current assets to current liabilities was 1.48 to 1, in excess of the minimum
requirement of 1.25 to 1.

The Company and its subsidiaries also have from various banking sources
approximately $38,000,000 of unused short-term lines of credit at rates of
interest approximating the prime commercial rate.  These funds are available
subject to satisfying covenant restrictions as to funded debt limitations.  In
1994, the average month-end borrowings were $8,400,000, and the highest
month-end balance was $13,400,000.  Comparable amounts for 1993 were $4,800,000
and $12,300,000 and $4,600,000 and $11,357,000, for 1992.  The effective annual
borrowing rate was 4.2% in 1994, 4.9% in 1993 and 8.6% in 1992.

Interest payments with respect to all of the Company's borrowing arrangements
amounted to $9,655,000 in 1994, $10,430,000 in 1993 and $17,225,000 in 1992.

5.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables and payables, debt obligations and swap
transactions, and foreign exchange forward contracts.  The book value of cash
and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables and short-term debt are
considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.  The fair value of long-term debt and the currency and
interest rate swap has been estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based
upon the incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements with comparable terms and maturities.  At June 30, 1994, the
Company's long-term debt was $135,381,000, and this amount exceeded fair value
by approximately $4,500,000.

The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange forward
contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.  These contracts
hedge primarily firm commitments of less than one year that are denominated in
foreign currencies.  At June 30, 1994, the Company had $4,300,000 of contracts
outstanding and the carrying value of these contracts was not materially
different from fair value.

6.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The cost of providing pension, retirement and profit sharing benefits charged
to operations amounted to $4,932,000 in 1994, $5,141,000 in 1993 and $4,945,000
in 1992.  For 1994, the expense of defined benefit plans equalled $533,000,
while the expense of defined contribution plans was $3,859,000 and
multi-employer plan expense was $540,000.  Comparable figures for 1993 were
$105,000, $4,389,000 and $607,000, and for 1992, $767,000, $3,568,000 and
$610,000.  Pension expense of domestic and foreign defined benefit plans were
based on the provisions of SFAS No. 87.  Components of pension expense for
defined benefit plans included the following items:

The funded status of the foreign and domestic defined benefit plans is
displayed below and is based on information supplied by the actuary as of March
31 of each year.  For 1994 and 1993, the calculations assume a weighted-average
discount rate of 8%, an anticipated long-term rate of return of 9% and an
increase in compensation levels of 5%.  For 1992, the calculations assumed a
weighted-average discount rate of 8.5%, an anticipated long-term rate of return
on plan assets of 9.5% and an increase in compensation levels of 5.0%.  The
assets of the plans consist of listed bonds, stocks, mutual investment funds
and cash securities.  In connection with the recognition of the minimum
liability as required by SFAS No. 87, the Company has recorded an intangible
asset of $1,066,000, included in Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet, and an equity reduction of $2,123,000.

</TABLE>

The Company has accrued $8,224,000 for workers' compensation claims as of June
30, 1994, and this amount is included in Accrued Expenses in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.

7.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The cost of providing health and life insurance benefits for certain retired
employees has been determined under the provisions of SFAS No. 106 for 1994 and
1993.  As a result, the estimated cost of these benefits has been accrued based
on the employees' active service lives.  In 1992, the cost of these benefits,
which were primarily health care, were expensed as claims were paid.  In 1994
and 1993, the expense for postretirement benefits other than pensions was
$2,443,900 and $2,172,000, respectively, while expenses in 1992 for claims paid
were $1,135,000.  All plans under which these benefits are provided are
unfunded.

In 1993, the Company recognized this change in accounting on the immediate
recognition basis.  The effect of adopting SFAS No. 106 as of the beginning of
1993 was to reduce pretax earnings by $13,389,000, and the accrual method of
accounting for postretirement health care costs was approximately equal to the
former claims paid method.

The Company continues to fund these benefits as claims are incurred.  Spending
limitations per annum are in effect for several plans and future retirees of
other plans will pay a portion of these costs.

A summary of plan information is as follows:

</TABLE>

Approximately 60% of the Company's inventories are valued at LIFO cost.

9.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Company and its subsidiaries have operating leases covering manufacturing
facilities and transportation and material handling equipment expiring at
various dates through 2004.  Rental costs charged to operations amounted to
$11,844,000 in 1994, $9,162,000 in 1993 and $8,677,000 in 1992.  At June 30,
1994, future commitments under the terms of non-cancelable operating leases for
minimum rentals are $7,640,000 in 1995, $7,000,000 in 1996; $5,850,000 in 1997,
$4,250,000 in 1998, $2,600,000 in 1999 and $8,300,000 in 2000 through 2004.

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal actions and
claims.  In the opinion of management, any liability which may ultimately be
incurred would not materially affect the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.

10.  COMMON SHARES

In October 1993, shareholders approved The Standard Products Company 1993
Employee Stock Option Plan.

Options to purchase common shares are granted under the 1993 plan and similar
plans adopted in 1991, 1989 and 1985.  For each plan, options are exercisable
over periods of five or ten years.  The option price is either the fair market
value at the time the option is granted or 110% of the fair market value at the
time the option is granted for those individuals owning more than ten percent
of the common shares of the Company.  Generally, options become exercisable one
year from the date of grant and annually thereafter.  No more than 40% of the
grant can be exercised in any one plan year.  Summarized below is stock option
activity for 1994.

</TABLE>

At June 30, 1994, options for 151,457 shares were exercisable at an average
exercise price of $23.07 a share.  Shares reserved for the future granting of
options were 373,995 at year end; 174,430 were reserved a year ago.

<PAGE>   28
Under The Standard Products Company 1991 Restricted Stock Plan, 375,000 common
shares were reserved for restricted stock awards.  Shares awarded are earned
ratably over the term of the restricted stock agreement, based upon achieving
specified performance goals.  Generally, transferability of shares earned is
restricted for a specified number of years following the year in which they
were earned.  Until the restrictions lapse, the recipient is entitled to all of
the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the shares, but the
shares are restricted as to transferability and subject to forfeiture to the
Company during the restriction period.  In 1992, 187,500 shares were awarded.
Of those shares, 20,800 were earned in 1994 and 25,000 were earned in 1993 and
1992.  In 1994, $585,000 was charged to operations as compensation expense
based upon the market value of the earned shares.  The similar charge to
operations in 1993 and 1992 was $866,000 and $665,000, respectively.  At year
end, 187,500 shares remain available for future awards.

11.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Earnings per common share have been determined based on the weighted average
common shares outstanding during the periods.  The averages for 1994, 1993 and
1992 were 16,626,927, 15,114,013 and 13,009,741, respectively.

12.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company's operations are in two industry segments.  The Transportation
Equipment Segment includes extruded and molded rubber and plastic products for
automotive, building and marine industries and plastic and magnetic door seals
for home appliances.  The Tread Rubber Segment produces tread rubber for the
truck tire retreading industry.

Net sales by segment include both sales to unaffiliated customers, as reported
in the Company's consolidated statements of income, and intersegment sales.
Operating income consists of net sales less applicable operating costs and
expenses related to those sales.  In computing operating income, general
corporate expenses are excluded.  Identifiable assets by segment are those
assets that are used in the operations of each segment.  General corporate
assets are those not identifiable with the operations of a segment.

Approximately 56%, 65% and 71% of the Company's annual revenues in 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively, are represented by direct sales to automotive original
equipment customers - Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.  Likewise, at year
end, 36% of accounts receivable are concentrated in the automotive market.  The
Company does not view such a concentration in the automotive market as an
unusual credit risk.  Sales to the automotive original equipment customers
include a number of different products and types of the same product, the sales
of which are not interdependent.

In accordance with the Company's policy, as of June 30, 1994, federal income
taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries.  If these earnings were distributed, approximately $8,000,000 of
tax would be payable.

In connection with cash flow information, the Company paid $20,338,000 in 1994,
$16,022,000 in 1993 and $12,200,000 in 1992 for federal, foreign and state
taxes on income.

Through its United Kingdom subsidiaries, the Company has available net
operating loss carryforwards of $28,000,000 for income tax purposes with no
limit as to expiration under United Kingdom tax regulations.  For financial
reporting purposes and the adoption of SFAS No. 109, the Company has recognized
valuation allowances equal to the deferred tax assets related to these tax loss
carryforwards.

<PAGE>   31
At June 30, 1994, deferred tax liabilities were $25,600,000 and deferred tax
assets were $19,900,000.  The major component of deferred tax liabilities is
$25,000,000 for excess depreciation and amortization.  In addition to the loss
carryforward and valuation allowance noted above, deferred tax assets include
$1,400,000 for discontinued operations and $14,400,000 related to employee
benefits.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To The Shareholders and the Board of Directors,
The Standard Products Company:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Standard
Products Company (an Ohio corporation) and Subsidiary Companies as of June 30,
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
June 30, 1994.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Standard
Products Company and Subsidiary Companies as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended June 30, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective June
29, 1992, the Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and income taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


The accompanying financial statements were prepared under management's
direction, which has responsibility for their integrity and objectivity.  These
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied and, where appropriate, reflect estimates based
upon management's best judgment.

Management is further responsible for maintaining a system of internal
accounting controls, designed to provide reasonable assurance that the books
and records reflect the transactions of the companies and that its established
policies and procedures are carefully followed.  The system is continually
reviewed for its effectiveness and is augmented by segregation of
responsibilities, written policies and guidelines, the careful selection and
training of qualified personnel and an internal audit program.

Management believes that the Company's accounting controls provide reasonable
assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial
statements do not occur or would be detected within a timely period by
employees performing their assigned functions.  However, inherent limitations
exist in any system of internal controls and, of course, the cost of controls
should not exceed their benefits.  Management believes that the Company's
balance between the costs and benefits of controls reasonably assures the
reliability of its financial reporting at reasonable costs.

Arthur Andersen & Co., independent public accountants, are engaged to audit the
financial statements of the Company and issue reports thereon.  Their audit is
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and,
accordingly, includes tests of accounting records and such other auditing
procedures as they consider necessary in the circumstances.  The accountants'
report appears elsewhere.

The Board of Directors, through the Audit Committee of the Board, is
responsible for:  (1) assuring that management fulfills its responsibilities in
the preparation of the financial statements; and (2) engaging the independent
public accountants with whom the Committee reviews the scope of the audit and
the accounting principles to be applied in financial reporting.  The Audit
Committee, which is comprised entirely of seven outside Directors, meets
regularly (separately and jointly) with the independent public accountants,
representatives of management, and the internal auditors to review the
activities of each and to ensure that each is properly discharging its
responsibilities.  To ensure complete independence, Arthur Andersen & Co. has
full and free access to meet with the Audit Committee, without management
representatives present, to discuss the results of their audit, accounting and
financial reporting matters and internal accounting controls.

IN MEMORIAM

This past year The Standard Products Co. lost a respected and well-loved
colleague when Director Emeritus Charles (Charlie) Brooks passed away.  Mr.
Brooks became associated with Standard Products in 1967 following the
acquisition of his two companies, Campbell Plastics Company and Cee-Bee
Manufacturing Company.  He became a senior executive of Standard Products and a
member of the Board of Directors.  Through his dedication and knowledge, he
contributed significantly to the success of Standard Products.  He is missed by
all of us.
