ITEM 1. BUSINESS
                                    GENERAL
     The Company provides a broad range of integrated management services,
expense management programs and mortgage banking services to more than 2,000
clients, including many of the world's largest corporations, as well as
governmental agencies and affinity groups. Its primary business service
segments consist of vehicle management, relocation and real estate and mortgage
banking. Information as to revenues, operating income and identifiable assets
by business segment is included in the Business Segments note in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
     As of June 30, 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately
5,000 employees.
                          VEHICLE MANAGEMENT SERVICES
     Vehicle management services consist primarily of the management, purchase,
leasing and resale of vehicles for corporate clients and governmental agencies,
including fuel and expense management programs and other fee-based services for
clients' vehicle fleets.
FLEET MANAGEMENT SERVICES
     The Company provides fully integrated vehicle management and leasing
programs through PHH Vehicle Management Services. These programs were developed
to meet the specific needs of companies using large and small numbers of cars
and trucks and consist of managerial, leasing and advisory services, aimed at
reducing and controlling the cost of operating corporate fleets.
     The Company's advisory services for automobile fleet management programs
include recommendations on the makes and models of cars and accessories best
suited to the client's use, the determination of persons eligible for company
cars, the method of reimbursing field representatives for actual car expenses,
the care and maintenance of cars and the personal use of company cars.
     Managerial services for automobile fleet programs include purchasing
automobiles, arranging for their delivery through new car dealers located
throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland, complying with various local registration, title, tax and insurance
requirements, pursuing warranty claims with automobile manufacturers and
selling used cars at replacement time.
     The Company offers similar programs and services for vans and light and
heavy-duty truck fleets. Advisory services offered include the determination of
the vehicle specifications, makes, models and equipment best suited to perform
the functions required by the client. Managerial services include purchasing
new vans, light and heavy-duty trucks, trailers, truck bodies and equipment
from manufacturers and franchised dealers, the performance of title,
registration, tax and insurance functions, arranging for them to be titled,
licensed and delivered to locations designated by clients, verifying invoices
and selling used vehicles at replacement time.
     The Company offers various leasing plans for its vehicle leasing programs.
Under these plans, the Company provides for the financing primarily through the
issuance of commercial paper and medium-term notes and through unsecured
borrowings under revolving credit agreements and bank lines of credit. See the
Liabilities Under Management Programs note in Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
     The Company leases vehicles for minimum lease terms of twelve months or
more under either direct financing or operating lease agreements. The Company's
experience indicates that the full term of the leases may vary considerably due
to extensions beyond the minimum lease term. Under the direct financing lease
agreements, resale of the vehicles upon termination of the lease is generally
for the account of the lessee. The Company has two distinct types of operating
leases. Under one type, the open-end operating lease, resale of the vehicles
upon termination of the lease is for the account of the lessee except for a
minimum residual value which the Company has guaranteed. The Company's
experience has been that vehicles under this type of lease agreement have
consistently been sold for amounts exceeding residual value guarantees. Under
the other type of operating lease, the closed-end operating lease, resale of
the vehicle on termination of the lease is for the account of the Company.
                                       1
 
<PAGE>
     The Company's fleet management services may be the same whether the client
owns or leases the vehicles. In either case, the client generally operates the
vehicles on a net basis, paying all the actual costs incidental to their
operation, including gasoline, oil, repairs, tires, depreciation, vehicle
licenses, insurance and taxes. The fee charged by the Company for its services
is based upon either a percentage of the original cost of the vehicle or a
stated management fee and, in the case of a leasing client, includes the
interest cost incurred in financing the vehicle.
FUEL AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
     The Company offers fuel and expense management programs to corporations
and governmental agencies for the control of automotive business travel
expenses in each of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Republic of
Ireland and Germany. Through a service card and billing service, a client's
traveling representatives are able to purchase various products and services
such as gasoline, tires, batteries, glass and maintenance services at numerous
outlets. The Company also provides a series of safety-related programs,
statistical control reports detailing expenses related to the general operation
of vehicles, and a program which monitors and controls the type and cost of
vehicle maintenance for individual automobiles.
     The Company also provides a fuel and expense management program and a
centralized billing service for companies operating truck fleets in each of the
United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Germany. Drivers
of the clients' trucks are furnished with courtesy cards together with a
directory listing the names of strategically located truck stops and service
stations which participate in this program. Service fees are earned for the
billing, collection and record keeping services and for assuming the credit
risk. These fees are paid by the truck stop or service stations and/or the
fleet operator and are based upon the total dollar amount of fuel purchased or
the number of transactions processed.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
     The principal methods of competition within vehicle management services
are service quality and price.
     In the United States and Canada, an estimated 30% of the market for
vehicle management services is served by third-party providers. There are 5
major providers of such services in North America, as well as an estimated
several hundred local and regional competitors. The Company shares the market
leadership with one other provider.
     In the United Kingdom, the portion of the fuel card services and vehicle
management services markets served by third-party providers is an estimated 37%
and 35%, respectively. The Company is the market leader among the 4 major
nation-wide providers of fuel card services, and a market leader among the 7
major nation-wide providers of vehicle management services. Numerous local and
regional competitors serve each such market element.
     The following sets forth certain statistics concerning automobiles, vans,
light and heavy-duty trucks for which the Company provides managerial, leasing
and/or advisory services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the
Republic of Ireland and Germany at the end of the fiscal years shown:

                      RELOCATION AND REAL ESTATE SERVICES
EMPLOYEE RELOCATION
     The Company provides employee relocation services principally to large
international corporations, governmental agencies and affinity groups in the
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland through
PHH Homequity Corporation and other relocation subsidiaries. Principal services
consist of counseling transferred employees of clients and the purchase,
management and resale of their homes. The Company's relocation services offer
clients the opportunity to reduce employee relocation costs and facilitate
employee relocation.
     The relocation subsidiary pays a transferring employee his/her equity in a
home based upon a value determined by independent appraisals. In certain
circumstances the employee's mortgage may be retired concurrently with the
purchase of the equity; otherwise the relocation subsidiary normally accepts
the administrative responsibility for making payments on any mortgages.
Following payment to the employee, the corporate client normally pays the
relocation subsidiary an advance billing to cover costs to be incurred during
the period the home is held for resale, including debt service on any existing
mortgage. These costs are paid by the relocation subsidiary and, after ultimate
resale, a settlement is made with the corporate client reconciling the advance
billing and the expense payments. Under the terms of the client contracts, the
relocation subsidiaries are generally protected against losses from changes in
market conditions.
     Funds to finance the purchase of homes are provided primarily through the
issuance of commercial paper and medium-term notes and occasionally through
unsecured borrowings under revolving credit agreements and bank lines of
credit, or may be provided by the client. Interest costs are billed directly to
the Company's clients. See the Liabilities Under Management Programs note in
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
     The Company's relocation subsidiaries also offer programs which provide
home marketing, moving services, rental management, spousal career counseling
and consulting services for transferred employees to help in selecting their
new communities and homes. The destination services operations focus on
developing and delivering home-finding and settling-in services for individual
customers through local centers.
     Through its PHH Fantus Corporation subsidiary, the Company provides
strategic facilities planning services, site selection and location consulting
for corporate clients and governmental agencies. Additionally, the Company
provides consulting services in the areas of general business strategy,
marketing and management for transnational clients.
REAL ESTATE SERVICES
     The Company provides real estate services through PHH Homequity
Corporation and other relocation subsidiaries. These services primarily include
the management and resale of homes for financial institutions and governmental
agencies in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
     The principal methods of competition within relocation and real estate
services are service quality and price. In the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom, an estimated 25% of the market for relocation and real estate
services is served by third-party providers.
     In each of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, there are 4
major national providers of such services. There are an estimated several dozen
local and regional competitors in each such country. The Company is the market
leader in the United States and Canada, and third in the United Kingdom.

MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES
     The Company provides residential mortgage banking services through PHH US
Mortgage Corporation. These services consist of the origination, sale and
servicing of residential first mortgage loans. A variety of first mortgage
products as well as casualty insurance-related products are marketed to
consumers through relationships with corporations, affinity groups, real estate
brokerage firms and other mortgage banks.
     PHH US Mortgage is a centralized mortgage lender conducting business in

closing attorneys, the Company can effectively administer its products and
services anywhere in the nation.
     The mortgage unit customarily sells all mortgages it originates to

individual loans, as mortgage-backed securities or as participation
certificates issued or guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) while generally retaining mortgage
servicing rights. The guarantees provided by FNMA and FHLMC are on a
non-recourse basis to the Company. Guarantees provided by GNMA are non-recourse
to the extent recoverable from certain government insurance programs.
     Mortgage servicing consists of collecting loan payments, remitting
principal and interest payments to investors, holding escrow funds for payment
of mortgage-related expenses such as taxes and insurance, and otherwise
administering the Company's mortgage loan servicing portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

    All comparisons within the following discussion are to the previous year,
unless otherwise stated. 

    Consolidated results: Net income increased 14% to $64.6 million in fiscal
1994. Net income per share increased 12% to $3.64. The increase in net income
was due to increases in the mortgage banking services and vehicle management
services business segments, partially offset by a decrease in the relocation and
real estate services business segment. In fiscal 1993, net income increased 13%
to $56.4 million and net income per share increased 11% to $3.25, reflecting
increases in all three of the Company's business segments, though primarily in
mortgage banking services. 

    Consolidated revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in fiscal 1994 and 5% to
$2.0 billion in fiscal 1993. 

    The provision for income taxes reflects effective tax rates of 41.2%, 40.1%
and 39.9% in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The fiscal 1994 rate
reflects the increase in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to
35%. The additional tax accrued to adjust the Company's deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the effect of the increased income tax rate was offset by an
adjustment of tax accruals based upon the completion of certain tax
examinations. 

Vehicle Management Services 
    Vehicle management services primarily consist of the management, purchase,
leasing and resale of vehicles for corporate clients and governmental agencies,
including fuel and expense management programs and other fee-based services for
clients' vehicle fleets.

Operating Income                    $  46,230    $  42,272    $  40,735
</TABLE>

    Leasing revenues increased 8% to $968 million in fiscal 1994 and 8% to $895
million in fiscal 1993. The increases were primarily due to a reduced amount, in
comparison to prior years, of leases and leased vehicles sold or transferred to
third parties for which management and servicing responsibility is retained. Had
these assets not been sold or transferred, the related rental payments would
have been included in revenues and the related depreciation on vehicles under
operating leases and interest would have been included in expenses. On a pro
forma basis, the result would have been a decrease in leasing revenues of 6% for
fiscal 1994 and 3% for fiscal 1993. The decreases in pro forma leasing revenues
were primarily due to a lower rental interest component charged on certain
leases and leased vehicles due to reduced interest rates and a decrease in the
number of leased vehicles under management. 

    Other revenues increased 11% to $194 million in fiscal 1994 and 6% to $175
million in fiscal 1993. The increases were primarily due to growth in domestic
fee-based services such as vehicle maintenance management programs and a
favorable resale market for disposition of vehicles under closed-end leases.

</TABLE>

    Vehicle management services operating income increased 9% to $46.2 million
in fiscal 1994. The increase was primarily due to increases from the continuing
positive effects of a favorable resale market for disposition of vehicles under
closed-end leases, higher management fees resulting from increases in the
average cost of vehicles managed, growth in domestic fee-based vehicle services
as reflected in the number of fuel and service card transactions and gallons
processed (see key operating factors) as well as the favorable effect of
productivity efforts. Partially offsetting the increase were decreased revenues
resulting from a slight decrease in the number of vehicles under management as
well as increased selling, general and administrative costs including costs
related to certain information technology improvements. 

    In fiscal 1993, operating income increased 4% to $42.3 million. The increase
was primarily due to growth in fee-based vehicle management services as well as
improvements in fuel and expense management programs in the UK. These
improvements were partially offset by a decrease in domestic fuel and expense
management programs, a decrease in the number of vehicles under management,
continued investment toward expansion into Continental Europe, and a reduction
due to the effect of foreign currency translation.

    The Company's profitability from vehicle management services is affected by
the number of vehicles managed and related services provided for clients.
Profitability can also be affected as corporate clients exercise a higher degree
of caution by decreasing the size of their vehicle fleets or by extending the
service period of existing fleet vehicles. Operating results should be
positively affected as clients choose to outsource their vehicle management
services and as the Company expands into new markets, further enhances its
product diversity, broadens its client base and continues its productivity and
quality improvement efforts. 

Relocation and Real Estate Services 
    Relocation and real estate services primarily consist of the purchase,
management and resale of homes for transferred employees of corporate clients,
governmental agencies and affinity groups. Other programs include fee-based
services which provide assistance to the transferring employee and real estate
services to financial institutions as well as other consulting services.

</TABLE>

    Relocation and real estate services revenues decreased 2% to $816 million in
fiscal 1994. Revenue decreases were primarily due to a reduction in the number
of transferee homes sold in the US and UK and a reduction in interest rates and
other direct costs of carrying and reselling homes, which are charged to the
Company's clients. These decreases were partially offset by revenue increases
due to an increase in the number of homes sold in Canada resulting from an
acquisition in fiscal 1994; an increase in domestic fee-based relocation
services such as home marketing programs, group move planning and household
goods moving; and an increase in the average value of transferee homes sold in
the US. 

    In fiscal 1993, revenues decreased 2% to $829 million. The decrease was
primarily due to a reduction in interest rates and other direct costs of
carrying and reselling homes, which are passed through to the Company's clients,
partially offset by an increase in the number of transferee homes sold in the US
and favorable results in the US from other fee-based relocation services.

    Costs of carrying and reselling homes and interest decreased 3% to $718
million in fiscal 1994 and 3% to $739 million in fiscal 1993. The decreases were
primarily due to a decrease in interest expense caused by a reduction in
interest rates as noted above, as well as a reduction in other direct costs of
carrying and reselling homes due to a reduction in the number of days homes were
held for resale. In fiscal 1994, increased costs were incurred due to an
increase in the number of homes sold resulting from the Company's acquisition in
Canada and to enhance the Company's global information technology.

    Relocation and real estate services operating income decreased 19% to $21.5
million in fiscal 1994. The decrease was primarily due to costs incurred by the
Company to broaden its worldwide consulting business, enhance its global
information technology and consolidate office space in North America, as well as
integration costs from its acquisition in Canada. The decrease was partially
offset by improvement in the results of other fee-based relocation and real
estate services and an increase in the value of transferee homes sold in the US.


    In fiscal 1993, operating income increased 1% to $26.6 million. The increase
was primarily due to increases in the number of transferee homes sold in the US
as well as improvement in other fee-based services in the US. Partially
offsetting the increase were decreases in the number of homes sold and a
reduction of real estate services provided in the UK and Canada, as well as the
minor effect of a change in the application of revenue recognition accounting
policies in the UK to more closely align policies for similar product lines on a
worldwide basis. 

    The Company is generally not at risk on its carrying value of homes should
there be a downturn in the housing market. Management anticipates that, as
businesses continue to reassess their relocation plans as part of cost control
measures, the results of the relocation services segment may be impacted.
However, operating results should be positively affected as the Company expands
into new markets, enhances its product diversity, broadens its client base and
continues its productivity and quality improvement efforts.

Mortgage Banking Services 

    Mortgage banking services primarily consist of the origination, sale and
servicing of residential first mortgage loans. A variety of first mortgage
products are marketed to consumers through relationships with corporations,
affinity groups, real estate brokerage firms and other mortgage banks.

    Mortgage banking services revenues increased 28% to $156 million in fiscal
1994. The increase was primarily due to a large percentage increase in loan
closing volume as well as a 51% increase in the servicing portfolio. The value
of loan closings increased 44% due to growth in volume from established customer
relationships, increased market penetration, as well as volume generated from
residential mortgage refinancings. Similarly, in fiscal 1993, revenues increased
37% to $122 million. 

    Direct costs and interest increased 23% to $86 million in fiscal 1994 and
25% to $70 million in fiscal 1993. The increases were primarily due to increased
costs to support increased loan closings and a larger servicing portfolio
partially offset by reduced interest rates. Additionally, direct costs include
unscheduled amortization of excess mortgage servicing fees of $11.3 million and
$11.9 million in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    Mortgage banking services operating income increased 66% to $42.1 million in
fiscal 1994 and 58% to $25.4 million in fiscal 1993. The increase reflects
increases in revenues as discussed above, partially offset by higher costs
incurred due to increased loan closings as well as higher costs of managing the
larger servicing portfolio. 

    The Company's profitability from mortgage banking services will be affected
by such external factors as the level of interest rates, the strength of the
various segments of the economy, and the condition of residential real estate
markets. The Company is experiencing a slowdown in refinancing activity due to a
rise in interest rates. Management believes the Company's broad-based marketing
strategies and continuous quality improvement efforts, as well as its focus on
building and maintaining a high quality servicing portfolio, should continue to
positively affect operating results.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

    In fiscal 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions". Additionally, in November 1992, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 112, effective in fiscal 1995,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". Application of this
statement will require the Company to change from the cash basis to the accrual
basis of recording the costs of benefits provided to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. The effect of this statement
has been estimated and will not significantly affect the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. 


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

    The Company manages its funding sources to ensure adequate liquidity for
servicing of existing liabilities and by obtaining longer-term funds required to
meet the Company's strategic growth objectives. The mix of funding sources
depends on market conditions at the time, the characteristics of the assets of
the Company, and the management of diverse international funding sources for the
greatest long-term financial flexibility. 

    The sources of liquidity fall into three general areas: ongoing liquidation
of assets under management, international money and capital markets, and
committed credit agreements with various high-quality domestic and international
banks. In the ordinary course of business, the liquidation of assets under
management programs, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities,
provide the cash flow necessary for the repayment of existing liabilities. (See
Operating Activities and Investing Activities in the Company's Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.) 

    Based upon historical information, the Company projects the time period that
a client's vehicle will be in service or the length of time that a home will be
held in inventory before being sold on behalf of a client. Within mortgage
banking services, the asset characteristics reflect the length of time from
commitment to the sale of mortgages to unrelated investors. Once the asset
characteristics are projected, the Company generally matches the projected
dollar amount, interest rate and maturity characteristics of the assets within
the overall funding program. This is accomplished through stated debt terms or
effectively modifying such terms through other instruments, primarily interest
rate swap agreements and revolving credit agreements. Interest rate risk on
mortgages originated for sale is managed through the use of forward delivery
contracts, financial futures and options. 

    To maintain the integrity of its assets under management, the Company
maintains rigorous client credit standards to minimize credit risk and the
potential for losses. 

    Domestic and international financial markets provide a variety of sources of
funding. The Company has consciously managed these sources to ensure broad
access to major money and capital markets. Depending upon asset growth and
financial market conditions, the Company utilizes the United States, Euro,
Canadian and Sterling commercial paper markets, as well as other cost effective
short-term instruments. In addition, the Company utilizes the public and private
debt markets to issue unsecured senior corporate debt. Augmenting these sources,
the Company has reduced outstanding debt by the sale or



                                       10

transfer of managed assets to third parties while retaining fee-related
servicing responsibility. The Company's aggregate commercial paper outstanding
totaled $2.1 and $1.9 billion at April 30, 1994 and April 30, 1993,
respectively. At April 30, 1994, $1.2 billion in medium-term notes and $185
million in other debt securities were outstanding compared to $1.1 billion and
$390 million, respectively, in fiscal 1993. (See Financing Activities in the
Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.) From a risk management
standpoint, borrowings not in the local currency of the business unit are
converted to the local currency through the use of foreign currency forward
contracts. 

    To provide additional financial flexibility, the Company's current policy is
to ensure that minimum committed bank facilities aggregate 80% of the average
amount of outstanding commercial paper. Committed revolving credit agreements
totaling $2.4 billion and uncommitted lines of credit aggregating $330 million
are currently in place with 31 domestic and international banks. Management
closely evaluates not only the credit quality of the banks but the maturity of
the various agreements to ensure ongoing availability. Of the Company's $2.4
billion in committed facilities at April 30, 1994, the full amount was undrawn
and available. Management believes that its current policy provides adequate
protection should financial stress occur in the commercial paper or medium-term
note markets. 

    These established means of effectively matching floating and fixed interest
rate and maturity characteristics of funding to related assets, the variety of
short- and long-term domestic and international funding sources, and the
committed banking facilities enable the Company to service its debt and offer a
broad spectrum of service products to its clients.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PHH
Corporation and subsidiaries at April 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(In thousands except per share data) 


ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

    The accounting policies of PHH Corporation conform to generally accepted
accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of PHH Corporation and its wholly-owned domestic and foreign
subsidiaries (the Company). Policies outlined below include all policies
considered significant. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated. 

Vehicle Management Services 

    Vehicle management services primarily consist of the management, purchase,
leasing, and resale of vehicles for corporate clients and governmental agencies,
including fuel and expense management programs and other fee-based services for
clients' vehicle fleets. Revenues from these services other than leasing are
taken into income over the periods in which the services are provided and the
related expenses are incurred. 

    The Company leases vehicles to corporate fleet users under operating and
direct financing lease arrangements. The initial lease term typically covers a
period of twelve months or more and thereafter may be extended at the option of
the lessee. The Company records the cost of leased vehicles as an "investment in
leases and leased vehicles." Amounts charged to lessees for interest on the
unrecovered investment are credited to income on a level yield method which
approximates the contractual terms. 

Relocation and Real Estate Services 

    Relocation services primarily consist of the purchase, management and resale
of homes for transferred employees of corporate clients, governmental agencies
and affinity groups. The Company pays transferring employees their equity based
on an appraised value of their homes, determined by independent appraisers,
after deducting any outstanding mortgages. In certain circumstances the
mortgages may be retired concurrently with the purchase of the equity;
otherwise, the relocation management subsidiaries normally accept administrative
responsibility for making payments on any mortgages. These mortgages are either
retired at settlement or assumed by the purchaser when the homes are resold,
which generally is within six months. 

    The client normally pays an advance billing for a portion of the costs to be
incurred during the period the home is held for resale. These advances are
included in "advances from clients." These costs are paid by the relocation
management subsidiaries and are identified as "carrying costs on homes under
management" until resale. After resale, a settlement of actual costs and the
advance billing is made with the client. 

    Revenues and the related "costs, including interest, of carrying and
reselling homes" of the relocation management subsidiaries are recognized at
closing for the resale of the home. Under the terms of their contracts with
clients, the Company is generally protected against losses from changes in
market conditions. 

    The Company also offers fee-based programs such as home marketing programs,
moving services, rental management, and other programs designed to assist
transferred employees. The destination services operations focus on developing
and delivering home-finding and settling-in services for individual customers
through local centers. Revenues from these fee-based services are taken into
income over the periods in which the services are provided and the related
expenses are incurred. 

    Real estate services include fee-based services for the management and
resale of homes primarily for financial institutions and governmental agencies.
The Company also offers strategic management consulting services to corporate
clients and governmental agencies. Revenues from these fee-based services are
taken into income over the periods in which the services are provided and the
related expenses are incurred. 

Mortgage Banking Services 

    Mortgage banking services primarily include the origination, sale and
servicing of residential first mortgage loans as well as related insurance
products. The Company markets a variety of first mortgage products to consumers
through relationships with corporations, affinity groups, real estate brokerage
firms and other mortgage banks. Loan origination fees, commitment fees paid in
connection with the sale of loans, and direct loan origination costs associated
with loans held for resale, are deferred until the loan is sold. Fees received
for servicing loans owned by investors are based on the difference between the
weighted average yield received on the mortgages and the amount paid to the
investor, or on a stated percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance
on such loans. Servicing fees are credited to income when received. Costs
associated with loan servicing are charged to expense as incurred. 

    Sales of mortgage loans are generally recorded on the date a loan is
delivered to an investor. Sales of mortgage securities are recorded on the
settlement date. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized based
upon the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the
related mortgage loans sold. Such gains and losses are increased or decreased by
the amount of deferred mortgage servicing fees recorded. 

Property and Equipment 

    Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided by charges to
income over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Buildings are depreciated
on the straight-line method (25 to 45 years); building improvements, on the
straight-line method (10 to 20 years); equipment and leasehold improvements, on
either the double-declining balance or straight-line method (3 to 10 years); and
externally developed software is capitalized and amortized on the straight-line
method (5 years). Expenditures for improvements that increase value or that
extend the life of the assets are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations. Gains or losses from retirements and disposals of
property and equipment are included in selling, general and administrative
expense. 

Unamortized Goodwill 

    Unamortized goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible and
intangible assets of businesses acquired. It is being amortized by the straight-
line method over various periods up to 40 years and is included in selling,
general and administrative expense.

Assets Under Management Programs 

    Assets under management programs are held subject to leases or other client
contracts. The effective interest rates and maturity characteristics of the
leases and other contracts are generally matched with the characteristics of the
overall funding program. 

Translation of Foreign Currencies 

    Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates; equity accounts are translated at
historical exchange rates. Revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at
the average exchange rates for the periods presented. Translation gains and
losses are included in stockholders' equity including, for years prior to 1991,
transaction gains and losses resulting from forward exchange contracts on
foreign equity amounts net of income tax effects. Gains and losses resulting
from the change in exchange rates realized upon settlement of foreign currency
transactions are substantially offset by gains and losses realized upon
settlement of forward exchange contracts. Therefore, the resulting net income
effect of transaction gains and losses in all three years was not significant. 

Interest 

    Interest expense consists of interest on debt incurred to fund working
capital requirements and to finance vehicle leasing activities, relocation
services and mortgage banking operations. Interest used to finance equity
advances on homes is included in "costs, including interest, of carrying and
reselling homes" and was $23,491 in 1994, $43,041 in 1993, and $51,308 in 1992.
Total interest paid, including amounts within "costs, including interest, of
carrying and reselling homes," was $165,406 in 1994, $170,628 in 1993, and
$229,332 in 1992. 

Income Taxes 

    The provision for income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from items
reported in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes.
The Company computes deferred taxes using the liability method. No provision has
been made for US income taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries since it is the present intention of management to reinvest the
undistributed earnings indefinitely in foreign operations. Undistributed
earnings of the foreign subsidiaries at April 30, 1994, were $84,078. The
determination of unrecognized deferred US tax liability for unremitted earnings
is not practicable. However, it is estimated that foreign withholding taxes of
$5,462 may be payable if such earnings were remitted. 

Net Income Per Share 

    Net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the year and common stock equivalents arising
from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options under the treasury stock
method. The number of shares used in the calculations were approximately
17,741,000 for 1994, 17,357,000 for 1993, and 17,100,000 for 1992. 

Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires disclosure of the fair
value of certain on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate fair value. The fair values presented for certain
financial instruments are estimates, which in many cases may differ
significantly from the amounts which could be realized upon immediate
liquidation. In cases where market prices are not available, estimates of fair
value are based on discounted cash flow analyses which utilize current interest
rates for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit
quality. Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented
do not represent the underlying value of the Company. Financial instruments that
are subject to fair value disclosure requirements are carried in the financial
statements at amounts that approximate fair value, unless otherwise noted in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reclassifications 

    Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial
statements for comparative purposes. 


NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT 

    In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 112, effective in fiscal 1995, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." Application of this statement will require the Company
to change from the cash basis to the accrual basis of recording the costs
associated with benefits provided to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement. The effect of this statement has been
estimated and will not significantly affect the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. 


MORTGAGES HELD FOR RESALE 

    Mortgages held for resale represent mortgage loans originated by the Company
and held pending sale to permanent investors. Such mortgages are recorded at the
lower of cost or market value. 

    The Company is party to a variety of forward delivery contracts, financial
futures programs and options in order to minimize the risk of price fluctuations
with respect to both mortgage loans held for resale and anticipated mortgage
production arising from loan commitments issued. At April 30, 1994, the Company
had mandatory commitments to sell loans amounting to $997,300 and optional
commitments to sell loans amounting to $141,000 and commitments to fund loans
amounting to $561,000. These contractual commitments are taken into account
together with the stated interest on mortgages held for resale in recording
mortgages at the lower of cost or market value. The fair value of the mortgages
and related contractual commitments, estimated using quoted market prices of
similar instruments, approximates the carrying amount of mortgages held for
resale at April 30, 1994 and 1993. 

    The Company issues mortgage-backed certificates insured or guaranteed by the
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and other
private insurance agencies. The insurance provided by FNMA and FHLMC and other
private insurance agencies are on a non-recourse basis to the Company. However,
the guarantee provided by GNMA is only to the extent recoverable from insurance
programs of the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration.
The outstanding principal balance of mortgages backing GNMA certificates issued
by the Company aggregated approximately $1,139,199 and $611,234 at April 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively. Additionally, the Company sells mortgage loans as
part of various mortgage-backed security programs sponsored by FNMA, FHLMC, and
GNMA. Certain of these sales are subject to recourse or indemnification
provisions in the event of default by the borrower. As of April 30, 1994 and
1993,


                                       18

mortgage loans sold with recourse amounted to $14,400 and $23,800,
respectively. The Company believes adequate reserves are maintained to cover all
potential losses.

    The unamortized mortgage servicing fees represent the value of purchased
servicing rights and excess servicing fees which are deferred. Such servicing
rights and fees are charged to income over the estimated effective life of the
related mortgages, estimated to average 6 years. The fair value of excess
servicing fees, estimated using discounted cash flows, approximates the carrying
amount which was $74,200 and $58,500 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Mortgage loans serviced were $16,644,730 and $11,047,284 at April 30, 1994 and
1993, respectively. Intangible assets recognized from acquisitions of relocation
services companies are being amortized by the straight-line method over periods
ranging from 5 to 10 years. Residential properties held for resale are located
primarily in the US and are carried at the lower of cost or resale value.
Mortgage-related notes receivable are loans secured by real estate. 


ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS 

Net Investment in Leases and Leased Vehicles 

    The net investment in leases and leased vehicles at April 30 consisted of
the following:

                           $2,766,983    $2,716,956
</TABLE>

    The Company leases vehicles for initial periods of twelve months or more
under either direct financing or operating lease agreements. The Company's
experience indicates that the full term of the leases may vary considerably due
to extensions beyond the minimum lease term. Lessee repayments of investments
in leases and leased vehicles for 1994 and 1993 were $1,358,156 and
$1,173,994, respectively; and the ratios of such repayments to the average net
investment in leases and leased vehicles were 49% in 1994 and 46% in 1993. 

    The Company has two types of operating leases. Under one type, open-end
operating leases, resale of the vehicles upon termination of the lease is
generally for the account of the lessee except for a minimum residual value
which the Company has guaranteed. The Company's experience has been that
vehicles under this type of lease agreement have consistently been sold for
amounts exceeding the residual value guarantees. Maintenance and repairs of
vehicles under these agreements are the responsibility of the lessee. The
original cost of vehicles under this type of operating lease at April 30, 1994
and 1993, was $3,538,000 and $3,184,000, respectively. 

    Under the other type of operating lease, closed-end operating leases, resale
of the vehicles on termination of the lease is for the account of the Company.
The lessee generally pays for or provides maintenance, vehicle licenses and
servicing. The original cost of vehicles under these agreements at April 30,
1994 and 1993, was $367,000 and $484,000, respectively. The Company believes
adequate reserves are maintained in the event of loss on vehicle disposition. 

    Under the direct financing lease agreements, resale of the vehicles upon
termination of the lease is generally for the account of the lessee. Maintenance
and repairs of these vehicles are the responsibility of the lessee. 

    Leasing revenues are included in revenues from vehicle management services.
Following is a summary of leasing revenues for years ended April 30:

</TABLE>

    Other managed vehicles are subject to leases serviced by the Company for
others, and neither the vehicles nor the leases are included as assets of the
Company. The Company receives a financial spread under such agreements which
covers or exceeds its cost of servicing. The agreements are made in various
ways, some of which entail some risks of accounting loss to the Company, and all
of which has been included in its consideration of related reserves. 

    The Company has transferred existing managed vehicles and related leases to
unrelated investors and has retained servicing responsibility. Credit risk for
such agreements is retained by the Company to a maximum extent in one of two
forms: excess assets transferred which were $12,836 and $42,120 at April 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively; or guarantees to a maximum extent of $2,749 and
$3,475 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. All such credit risk has been
included in the Company's consideration of related reserves. The outstanding
balances under such agreements aggregated $189,480 and $392,642 at April 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively. 

    Other managed vehicles with balances aggregating $206,740 and $181,296 at
April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, are included in special-purpose entities
whose ownership is deemed unrelated to the Company and whose credit and residual
value risk characteristics are ultimately not the Company's responsibility.

Equity Advances on Homes 

    Equity advances on homes represent advances paid to transferring employees
of clients for their equity based on an appraised value of their homes. 

    The Company manages the resale of homes for unrelated investors under its
real estate management program in the UK. The Company receives a financial
spread under this agreement which covers or exceeds its cost of servicing. The
outstanding balance under such agreements aggregated $1,848 and $10,237 at April
30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The Company retains credit risk to the extent
of excess assets sold totaling $1,419 and $3,041 in 1994 and 1993, respectively,
which has been included in the Company's consideration of related reserves. 

Other Assets Under Management Programs 

    Other assets under management programs represent mortgage-related loans
receivable originated by the Company on behalf of corporate clients and secured
by real estate. Based on contracts with corporate clients, the Company is
generally protected against loss after taking into account all related costs. 


OTHER DEBT 

Other debt at April 30 consisted of the following: 

                         1994          1993
Commercial paper      $ 619,822    $ 411,128
Medium-term note        100,000      100,000
                      $ 719,822    $ 511,128

    As more fully described in the Note for Liabilities Under Management
Programs, commercial paper is primarily supported by committed one-year and
three-year revolving credit agreements. The weighted average interest rate on
commercial paper, all of which matures within ninety days, was 4.0% and 3.3% at
April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The medium-term note represents an
unsecured obligation having a fixed interest rate of 6.5% with interest payable
semi-annually and a term of 7 years payable in full in fiscal 2000. At April 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively, the fair value of the medium-term note, estimated
from quotes from brokers, was $95,930 and $101,180, respectively. 


INCOME TAXES 

    Provisions (credits) for income taxes for the years ended April 30, were
comprised as follows: 

                         1994         1993          1992
Current income taxes:

Deferred income taxes:
   Federal                7,686       (8,000)      (1,280)
   State and local       (3,000)      (2,873)        (653)

                       $ 45,238     $ 37,821     $ 33,138

    Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between the
financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and available
tax credit carryforwards. There was no valuation allowance relating to deferred
tax assets.

    Deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of April 30 were comprised as follows: 

                                            1994            1993

                                        $  (93,600)    $  (91,246)

    The portions of the 1994 income tax liability and provision classified as
current and deferred are subject to final determination based on the actual 1994
income tax returns. The liability and provision amounts for 1993 have been
reclassified to reflect the final determination made in filing the 1993 income
tax returns. 

    The Company paid income taxes of $35,739 in 1994, $50,092 in 1993, and
$42,011 in 1992. 

    The US federal statutory tax rate for the Company was 35% in 1994, and 34%
in 1993 and 1992. The effective tax rates on income were 41.2% in 1994, 40.1% in
1993 and 39.9% in 1992. A summary of the reasons for differences between the
statutory rate and the Company's effective rate follows:

    The Company's US federal income tax returns have been examined by the
Internal Revenue Service through April 30, 1991. 


LIABILITIES UNDER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS 

    Borrowings to fund assets under management programs are classified as
"liabilities under management programs" and, at April 30, consisted of the
following:
                               1994          1993
Commercial paper         $1,513,897    $1,479,671

    Commercial paper, all of which matures within ninety days, is supported by
committed revolving credit agreements described below and short-term lines of
credit. The weighted average interest rates on commercial paper were 4.0% and
3.3% at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

    Medium-term notes represent unsecured loans which mature as follows:
$1,043,235 in 1995 and $100,000 in 1997. The weighted average interest rates on
medium-term notes were 4.1% and 4.0% at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
At April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively the fair value of medium-term notes,
estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers, was $1,145,800 and $1,041,047. 

    Limited recourse debt and secured notes payable on vehicles under lease
primarily consist of secured loans arranged for certain clients for their
convenience. The lenders hold a security interest in the lease payments and the
clients' leased vehicles. The debt and notes payable mature concurrently with
the related lease payments. The aggregate lease payments due from the lessees
exceed the loan repayment requirements. The weighted average interest rates on
secured debt were 4.2% and 3.7% at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

    The Company has unsecured committed credit agreements with various banks
totaling $2,400,000. These agreements have both fixed and evergreen maturities
ranging from June 15, 1994 to April 28, 1997. The evergreen revolving credit
agreements require a notice of termination of one to three years. Interest rates
under all revolvers are either at fixed rates or vary with prime or the London
Interbank Offered Rate. Under these agreements, the Company is obligated to pay
annual commitment fees which were $3,975 and $3,954 in 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The Company has other unused lines of credit with various banks of
$223,000 and $121,000 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

    Other unsecured debt, all of which matures in 1995, includes other
borrowings under short-term lines of credit and other bank facilities. The
weighted average interest rates on unsecured debt were 5.2% and 5.3% at April
30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

    The Company employs interest rate swap agreements to match effectively the
fixed or floating rate nature of liabilities to the assets funded. The notional
amount of outstanding swap agreements is not indicative of the degree of risk of
accounting loss. At April 30, 1994 and 1993, the notional amount of swap
agreements with commercial and investment banks which effectively converts
outstanding short-term, floating rate debt to medium-term, fixed rate debt was
$708,368 and $938,624, respectively. The notional amount of swap agreements with
commercial and investment banks which effectively converts outstanding medium-
term fixed rate debt to short-term floating rate debt was $100,000 and $385,000,
at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The notional amount of swap agreements
with commercial and investment banks which effectively converts floating rate
debt to floating rate debt based on a different index was $1,040,000 and
$713,000 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Additionally, the Company has
entered into interest rate swap agreements with unrelated investors to whom it
has transferred certain managed leases and leased vehicles to effectively
convert fixed rate leases into floating rate leases. The notional amount of such
swaps is $64,131 and $108,238 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, against
which the Company has in place interest rate swap agreements with commercial and
investment banks as discussed above. The fair value of interest rate swaps
(used for hedging purposes) is the estimated amount the Company would receive or
pay to terminate the swap agreements at April 30,1994 and 1993, respectively,
taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of
the swap counterparties. The estimated fair values of the Company's interest
rate swaps at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, in a gain position
aggregated $5,929 and $15,693, respectively, and in a loss position aggregated
$6,064 and $29,854, respectively. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap
agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the
counterparties. The Company manages such risk by periodically evaluating the
financial condition of counterparties and spreading its positions among multiple
counterparties. 

    The Company has entered into foreign exchange contracts as hedges against
currency fluctuation on certain intercompany loans. Such contracts effectively
offset the currency risk applicable to approximately $85,852 and $231,944 of
obligations at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Market value gains and
losses are recognized, and the resulting gains and losses offset foreign
exchange gains or losses on such loans. At April 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, the fair value of the Company's foreign exchange contracts,
estimated by obtaining quotes from financial institutions, is a loss position
aggregating $260 and $8,587, respectively. 

    Although the period of service for a vehicle is at the lessee's option, and
the period a home is held for resale varies, management estimates, by using
historical information, the rate at which vehicles will be disposed and the rate
at which homes will be resold. These projections of estimated liquidations of
assets under management programs and the related estimated repayment of
liabilities under management programs as of April 30, 1994, as set forth in the
table below, indicate that the actual repayments of liabilities under management
programs will be different than required by contractual maturities.

STOCK OPTION, INVESTMENT AND INCENTIVE PLANS 

    The Company's employee stock option plans allow for options to be granted to
key employees for the purchase of common stock at prices not less than fair
market value on the date of grant. Either incentive stock options or non-
statutory stock options may be granted under the plans. The Company's Directors'
stock option plan allows for options to be granted to outside Directors of the
Company for the purchase of common stock at prices not less than fair market
value on the date of grant. Options become exercisable after one year from date
of grant on a vesting schedule provided by the plan and expire either eight or
ten years after the date of the grant. Option transactions during 1994, 1993,
and 1992 were as follows:

    At April 30, 1994, there were 1,218,241 shares of common stock reserved,
including 889,827 shares for issuance under the employee stock option plans,
265,914 shares for issuance under the employee investment plan and 62,500 shares
for issuance under the Directors' stock option plan. 

    Under provisions of the Company's employee investment plan, a qualified
retirement plan, eligible employees may generally have up to 10% of their base
salaries withheld and placed with an independent custodian and elect to invest
in common stock of the Company, an index equity fund, a growth equity fund, an
international equity fund, a fixed income fund, an asset allocation fund and/or
a money market fund. The Company's contributions vest proportionately in
accordance with an employee's years of vesting service, with an employee being
100% vested after three years of vesting service. For 1991 and prior years, the
Company matched, in common stock of the Company, employees' contributions to 6%
of their base salaries. Beginning in 1992 and thereafter, the Company matches,
in common stock of the Company, employee contributions to 3%, with an additional
3% match available at the end of the year based on the Company's operating
results. In 1994 and 1993, the Company made an additional match of 50% of
employee contributions greater than 3% up to 6%. The additional match, initially
invested in a money market fund, can be redirected by the employee into any of
the investment elections noted above. No additional match was made in 1992. The
Company's expenses for contributions included in selling, general and
administrative expenses were $4,020, $3,662, and $2,450 for the years ended
April 30, 1994 and the two preceding years, respectively. 

    The Company has incentive compensation plans for certain key employees. The
plans provide for the payment of cash bonuses or, in some instances, stock
incentives, based upon the achievement of predetermined performance objectives.
The related expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses for
1994, 1993 and 1992 was $6,086, $5,659 and $1,861, respectively. 


STOCK RIGHTS 

    On March 17, 1986, the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share
purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding on April 11, 1986. The
Company adopted an amendment to its rights agreement January 16, 1989. Each
right entitles the holder to purchase 1/100th of a share of series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $120. The rights become
exercisable in the event any party acquires or announces an offer to acquire 20%
or more of the Company's common stock. The rights expire April 10, 1996, and are
redeemable at $.05 per right prior to the time any party owns 20% or more of
the Company's outstanding common stock. In the event the Company enters into a
consolidation or merger after the time rights are exercisable, the rights
provide that the holder will receive, upon exercise of the right, shares of
common stock of the surviving company having a market value of twice the
exercise price of the right. Until the earlier of the time the rights become
exercisable, are redeemed or expire, the Company will issue one right with each
new share of common stock issued. The Company has designated 200,000 shares of
the authorized preferred shares as series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
for issuance upon exercise of the rights. 


PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

Pension Plans 

    The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all US employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Company's subsidiary located in the UK has a contributory defined benefit
pension plan, with participation at the employee's option. Under both the US and
UK plans, benefits are based on an employee's years of credited service and a
percentage of final average compensation. The Company's policy for both plans is
to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements plus other
amounts as the Company deems appropriate from time to time. 

    Pension cost for both plans for 1994, 1993, and 1992 included the following
components: 

                            1994         1993         1992
Service cost--benefits

Net pension cost           $ 5,104     $ 3,983     $ 3,560

    The following table provides a reconciliation of the actuarial present value
of projected benefit obligation for the plans in 1994 and 1993 and the Company's
recorded pension liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
April 30, 1994 and 1993: 

                                          1994         1993

Recorded liability                      $  6,966     $  7,042

    Plan assets are primarily invested in marketable securities. 


Supplemental Retirement Plans 

    The Company also sponsors two unfunded supplemental retirement plans to
provide certain key executives with benefits in excess of limits under the
federal tax law and to include annual incentive payments in benefit
calculations.

    The cost of these plans in 1994, 1993 and 1992 included the following
components: 

                                1994        1993      1992
Service cost--benefits

                              $ 1,582    $ 1,313    $ 1,197

    The following table provides a reconciliation of the actuarial present value
of projected benefit obligation for the plans and the Company's recorded
liability as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at April 30, 1994 and
1993:

                                    1994         1993
Accumulated benefit obligation
   Vested                       $  8,202     $  7,407
   Unvested                        1,445        1,077
                                $  9,647     $  8,484

Projected benefit obligation    $ 13,466     $ 10,656
Unrecognized net obligation       (1,856)      (2,088)
Unrecognized prior service cost   (2,941)      (1,034)
Minimum liability adjustment       2,562        2,464
Unrecognized net loss             (1,584)      (1,514)
Recorded liability              $  9,647     $  8,484

    In accordance with SFAS No. 87, $2,562 and $2,464 of additional minimum
liability is included in the recorded liability in 1994 and 1993, respectively,
to provide a total liability that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated
benefit obligation. The Company recorded an intangible asset of the same amount
which is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Assumptions 

    Certain assumptions were used in determining the cost and related
obligations under the US pension and unfunded supplemental retirement plans as
follows:

                           1994     1993     1992
Percent
Pension Cost:
   Discount rate           8.25     8.75     9.00
   Rate of increase in
    compensation           5.00     5.00     5.50
   Long-term rate of
    return on assets      10.00    10.00    10.00
Pension Obligation:
   Discount rate           8.25     8.25     8.75
   Rate of increase in
    compensation           5.00     5.00     5.00
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions 

    Effective May 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires
accrual accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions. The Company
provides healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees up
to the age of 65. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 106, the Company recognized the
costs of these benefits by expensing the benefits as paid. The aggregate costs
of such benefits did not exceed $500 in 1993 or 1992.

    The Company has elected to recognize the cost of its transition obligation
(the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of May 1, 1993) by
amortizing it on a straight-line basis over 20 years. The Company's SFAS No. 106
obligation and cost are based on a discount rate of 8.25%. The assumed rate of
increase in healthcare costs (healthcare cost trend rate) was 12% in 1994,
decreasing to 10% in 1995 and gradually decreasing to 4.75% by 2004. Increasing
the healthcare cost trend rates of future years by one percentage point would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $560 and would
increase annual aggregate service and interest costs by $161. 

    Net periodic postretirement benefits costs for 1994 included the following
components:

                                                          1994
Service cost - benefits earned during period           $   788
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement
 benefit obligation                                        469
Amortization of the unrecognized transition obligation     294
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost               $ 1,551

Status of Plan
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:
   Active employees fully eligible for benefits        $ 5,361
   Current retirees                                      1,599
                                                         6,960
Unrecognized transition obligation                      (5,583)
Recorded liability                                     $ 1,377

LEASE COMMITMENTS 

    Total rental expenses relating to office facilities and equipment were
$27,264, $25,368, and $25,994 for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Minimum
rental commitments under non-cancelable leases with remaining terms in excess of
one year are as follows:

        1995      $ 15,037      1998               $  7,970
        1996      $ 13,004      1999               $  4,703
        1997      $  9,303      2000-2004          $ 13,942
                                2005 & thereafter  $  1,863

    These leases provide for additional rentals based on the lessors' increased
property taxes, maintenance and operating expenses. 


ACQUISITION 

    In 1994 the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock of a Canadian
relocation company. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is not
material to the consolidated financial statements. 


CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

    The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in pending litigation of the
usual character incidental to the business transacted by them. In the opinion of
management, such litigation will not have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements. 

    The Company is contingently liable under the terms of an agreement involving
its discontinued aviation services segment for payment of Industrial Revenue
Bonds issued by local governmental authorities operating at three airports, as
well as guarantor on a note associated with the buyer of one office closed as
part of its disposition of its facilities management services segment. The
Company believes its allowance for disposition loss is sufficient to cover all
potential liability.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

    The Company operations are classified into three business segments: vehicle
management services, relocation and real estate services and mortgage banking
services. In the selected information by business segment and geographic area
which follows, previously reported operating income has been replaced by income
before income taxes to reflect the retroactive reclassification of "Other
expense, net" to "Selling, general and administrative" expenses. Further,
Canadian information has been combined with that of the United States to reflect
the Company's North American management structure. Additionally, minor
adjustments have been made to the methodology applied in allocating certain
income and expense items. None of these changes had a significant effect on the
information presented.

3.     PARTICIPATION

       An  individual who is a Director on the Effective Date shall become a
Participant  as  of such Effective Date. Any other individual shall become a
Participant  as of the date that he or she becomes a Director. Participation
shall continue until an individual is paid all of the amounts to which he or
she  is  entitled  hereunder;  provided, however, that the provisions of the
Plan  with respect to the deferral of Retainers and Fees, including matching
contributions, shall apply only with respect to Retainers and Fees earned by
an individual while he or she is a Director.

4.     MANDATORY DEFERRALS

       One-third  (1/3)  of  a  Director's  Retainers  shall  be deferred in
accordance  with the provisions of this Plan, without regard to any election
by  the  Participant.  Such  mandatory  deferrals  shall  be  credited  to a
Participant's Account as of the last day of each quarter of the Fiscal Year.
A   Participant  shall  be  100%  vested  in  the  portion  of  his  Account
attributable to mandatory deferrals at all times.

5.     MATCHING OF MANDATORY DEFERRALS

       (a)     Profitability  Match.  Mandatory deferrals will be matched by
hypothetical  matching  contributions  made  by  the  Corporation  if  the
Corporation attains specified earnings per share targets for the Fiscal Year
in  which  the mandatory deferrals are made. The targets for the 1994 Fiscal
Year  are  to  be  approved by the Board of Directors in connection with its
approval of this Plan. Prior to the beginning of each Fiscal Year thereafter, 
the  Board  of  Directors shall determine the applicable targets which
shall  form  an integral part of this Plan. Matching contributions shall not
exceed 100% of the mandatory deferrals, determined as of the dates such 
mandatory deferrals were credited to a Participant's Account.

       (b)     Crediting  of  Match.  Matching contributions with respect to
any  Fiscal Year shall be credited to a Participant's Account as of the last
day of June following that Fiscal Year.

<PAGE>

       (c)     Vesting.  A  Participant  shall vest in the portion of his or
her  Account  attributable  to matching contributions in accordance with the
following schedule.

                           Years of Service      Vested Percentage
                                 One                  33 1/3%
                                 Two                  66 2/3%
                                Three                  100%

               For  this purpose, the term "year of service" means each Fiscal 
Year in which an individual is a Director, including Fiscal Years prior
to  and inclusive of the Effective Date, and counting periods of six or more
months during a Fiscal Year as a complete Fiscal Year. Amounts distributable
to a Participant pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall be reduced to the extent
a  Participant  is not 100% vested when he or she is entitled to a 
distribution. The amount of the reduction shall be treated as a forfeiture.

6.     OPTIONAL DEFERRALS

       (a)     General  Rule.  In accordance with the election form approved
by  the  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, a Participant may
make  an  Optional Deferral Election to defer all or a portion of his or her
Fees  that  are  not  mandatorily  deferred  in  accordance  with Section 4.
Optional  Deferral  Elections  shall  be  made  on  a  Plan Year basis, with
deferrals  credited  to the Participant's Account as of the last day of each
quarter of the Plan Year for which the election is made. A Participant shall
be 100% vested in the portion of his or her Account attributable to optional
deferrals at all times.

       (b)     Time  of Election. An Optional Deferral Election form must be
submitted  to  the Secretary prior to January 1 of the Plan Year in which it
becomes  effective  and will be effective six months after the date on which
it  is  received by the Secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the
case  of  any individual who becomes a Participant on the Effective Date, an
Optional  Deferral  Election  form  for the short Plan Year beginning on the
Effective  Date and ending on December 31, 1993 may be submitted on any date
on  or before the Effective Date, and (ii) in the case of any individual who
becomes  a  Participant  after  the  Effective Date and on a date other than
January  1, an Optional Deferral Election form for the remainder of the Plan
Year in which he or she becomes a Participant may be submitted within thirty
(30)  days after becoming a Participant; provided, however, that in the case
of both (i) and (ii), the Election shall apply only to Fees earned following
the date the Election is submitted.

       (c)     Election  Irrevocable.  Once  submitted, an Optional Deferral
Election is irrevocable for the Plan Year to which it applies.

       (d)     Continuing  Effectiveness  of  Elections.  Once  submitted, a
Participant's  Optional  Deferral  Election  shall  continue  in  effect for
subsequent  Plan  Years unless a Participant submits a new Optional Deferral
Election form in accordance with the foregoing provisions.

7.     ACCOUNTS

       (a)     General.  An Account shall be established in the name of each
Participant.   Within  each  Account,  there  shall  be  three  subaccounts,
reflecting  a  Participant's  interests attributable to mandatory deferrals,
the match on such deferrals, and a Participant's optional deferrals.

<PAGE>

       (b)     Hypothetical Investment in Stock. For purposes of determining
the value of a Participant's Account, it shall be assumed that (i) as of the
date an amount is credited to the Participant's Account, 100% of such amount
is  invested  in  shares  of  Stock  and  such  shares  are allocated to the
Participant's  Account,  (ii)  once allocated, all shares remain so invested
until all distributions to a Participant have been made, and (iii) until all
distributions  have  been  made,  all  dividends are reinvested in shares of
Stock.
       (c)     Bookkeeping  Account  Only. The Account established in a Par-
ticipant's name is for bookkeeping purposes only. It is the intention of the
parties  that the Plan and Trust, and any Account established thereunder, be
unfunded  for  tax  purposes and further, that since this Plan is solely for
the  benefit  of Directors who are not employees, the Plan not be subject to
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

       (d)     Unsecured  Creditors. Participants in this Plan have the sta-
tus  of  unsecured  creditors of the Corporation, and the Plan constitutes a
mere  unsecured  promise  by the Corporation to make benefit payments in the
future.

       (e)     Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist it in meeting
its  obligations  hereunder, the Corporation may establish a Trust, 
substantially  in accordance with the terms of the model trust described in 
Revenue Procedure  92-64. If the Corporation establishes a Trust, shares of 
Stock equal  in  value to Participants' mandatory deferrals, the match on such 
deferrals, and optional deferrals, shall either be purchased by the trustee on
the  open  market  or  issued  directly  by  the  Corporation  to the Trust,
provided, however, that the aggregate number of shares of Stock to be issued
by the  Corporation  shall  not exceed two hundred fifty thousand (250,000)
shares,  as adjusted by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be
binding, final and conclusive, to reflect any stock dividend, stock split or
combination,  reclassification  or  other  capital  adjustment  in shares of
Stock.

8.     DISTRIBUTIONS

       (a)     Distributable Events.

       (1)     Retirement.  Subject  to subsection (b) hereof, a Participant
shall  become  entitled  to  distributions  from  the  Plan upon retirement.
Retirement  shall  be deemed to occur (i) on the date the Participant ceases
to  be  a Director for any reason other than disability or death, or (ii) on
the  later  of the date on which the Participant ceases to be a Director for
any  reason other than disability or death or the date the sum of his or her
age  and  years  of  service  equals  seventy  (70),  as  specified  in such
Participant's  last  Payment  Election  form  submitted  while  a  Director,
provided,  however,  that once an election has been made with respect to the
date  on  which  retirement  occurs,  no  change  in  that  election will be
effective  unless it is made at least twelve (12) months before distribution
would  have  begun  in the absence of the change. For this purpose, the term
"years of service" has the meaning set forth in Section 5.

       (2)     Disability.  Subject  to  subsection (b) hereof, in the event
that a Participant ceases to be a Director on account of total and permanent
disability  prior  to  retirement,  he  or  she  shall  become  entitled  to
distributions  from the Plan payable in the same form, and at the same time,
that  such distribution would have been payable, had the Participant met the
conditions  for  retirement set forth in paragraph (1) hereof on the date of
such  disability;  provided that total and permanent disability shall not be
deemed  to  occur until the date the Participant submits proof, satisfactory
to  the  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, that he or she is
entitled to begin receiving Social Security disability benefits.

<PAGE>

       (3)     Death.  In  the event a Participant dies prior to the receipt
of  any distributions from the Plan, his or her Designated Beneficiary shall
become  entitled  to distributions payable in the same form, and at the same
time,  that  such distributions would have been payable, had the Participant
met  the  conditions for retirement set forth in paragraph (1) hereof on the
date   of  death.  In  the  event  a  Participant  dies  subsequent  to  the
commencement  of  distributions but prior to the receipt of all installments
that   are  payable,  any  remaining  installments  shall  be  paid  to  the
Participant's  Designated  Beneficiary,  in  the same amount and at the same
time  that  the installments would have been paid to the Participant, had he
or  she  survived.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  a Participant dies
(whether  before  or  after distributions to the Participant have commenced)
and,  at  the  time of death, there is no Designated Beneficiary, any amount
remaining  to  be  paid  shall  be paid in a single sum to the Participant's
estate.

       (b)     Distribution and Installment Dates. Distributions in the form
of  a  single  sum  shall  be made as of the January 1 of the Plan Year next
following  the  date  of  the  Participant's retirement, total and permanent
disability  or  death,  as  the  case  may  be  (the  "distribution  date").
Distributions  in  the  form of installments shall commence to be made as of
such  January  1  and, thereafter, shall be made as of each January 1 during
the  remainder  of  the  installment  period. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
actual  distributions  of  all or part of the amount payable may be deferred
for  a  period  not  in excess of sixty (60) days following the distribution
date or any installment date, without the requirement to pay any interest or
other amount on account of the deferral.

       (c)     Amount Distributed

       (1)     Single Sum Distribution. If distribution is made to a 
Participant in a single sum, the amount distributed shall be equal to 
(i) the number  of  whole  shares allocated to a Participant's Account 
(and not paid in installments,  if  the Participant elects under subsection 
(d) to divide his or her distribution between the single sum and installment 
form of payment), or  cash representing the value of all or a percentage of 
the number of such shares,  plus  (ii) cash representing the value of any 
fractional shares remaining,  all determined as of the distribution date 
specified in subsection (b).

       (2)     Installment  Distribution.  If distribution is made to a 
Participant in installments, the amount distributed as of the distribution date
and  each  subsequent  installment  date  shall  be  equal  to  the quotient
obtained,  expressed  as  a  number of whole and fractional shares, when the
number  of  whole  shares  then standing to the credit of his or her Account
(and  not  paid  in a single sum, if the Participant elects under subsection
(d) to divide his or her distribution between the single sum and installment
form  of  payment)  is divided by the number of installments remaining to be
paid.  The  fifth (5th) installment also shall include any additional unpaid
amount.  Distribution  shall be made in (i) shares, or cash representing the
value  of  all  or a percentage of the number of such shares, plus (ii) cash
representing the value of any fractional shares remaining, all determined as
of the applicable distribution or installment date.

       (d)     Form  of  Payment. Distribution shall be made in a single sum
or in installments payable for a five (5) year period, or partly in the form
of  a single sum and partly in the form of installments, as specified in the
Payment  Election  form.  Prior  to  becoming a Participant (or at such time
specified  in  Section  6(b),  in  the  case  of  any Director who becomes a
Participant on a date other than a January 1), each Participant shall submit
a  Payment  Election  form.  Once  made,  no change in that election will be
effective  with  respect  to  a  distribution  made on account of retirement
unless it is made at least twelve (12) months before distribution begins.

       (e)     Stock  or Cash. Distribution shall be made in shares of Stock
(plus  cash  representing  the  value of any fractional shares), in cash, or
partly in the form of shares and partly in the form of cash, as specified in
the  Payment Election form. Prior to becoming a Participant (or at such time
specified  in  Section  6(b),  in  the  case  of 

<PAGE>

any Director who becomes a
Participant on a date other than a January 1), each Participant shall submit
a  Payment  Election form. Once made, the election of Stock or cash shall be
irrevocable.

       (f)     Distributions Attributable to Initial Partial Year Elections.
Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Plan or a Participant's Payment
Election, amounts attributable to a Participant's Optional
Deferral  Election under Section 6(b)(i) or (ii) hereof shall be distributed
in  cash  as of the distribution date specified in subsection (b) hereof. In
construing  the  foregoing  provisions of this Section 8 and a Participant's 
Payment Election, such amounts shall be subtracted from the amounts otherwise 
distributable.

9.     NONALIENATION

       A  Participant's  rights  to  benefit payments under the Plan are not
subject  in  any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, 
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the
Participant,  the  Participant's Designated Beneficiary or the Participant's
estate.

10.    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

       (a)     General.  Subject  to Section 12 hereof, this Plan may be 
altered,  amended, suspended, or terminated at any time, in any manner and for
any  reason by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however,
that  no  alteration,  amendment,  suspension, termination or similar action
shall  decrease  the  number  of shares of Stock credited to a Participant's
Account  or  adversely  affect  a  Participant's  rights appurtenant to such
shares, in both cases determined as of the earlier of the date the amendment
is adopted or made effective.


       (b)     Securities  Law  Restrictions.  To  the  extent prescribed by
16b-3 Rules, Plan provisions concerning the conditions under which Directors
are  eligible  to  participate  herein,  and the amount, price and timing of
awards  under  the  Plan,  including  mandatory  deferrals  and  matching
contributions,  may  not  be  amended more than once every six months, other
than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code.

11.    ADMINISTRATION

       (a)     General.  The  Plan shall be administered by the Compensation
Committee  of  the Board of Directors, and any question regarding the proper
administration  of  the Plan or the construction of any term hereof shall be
resolved by it, in its sole discretion.

       (b)     Agents.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Compensation
Committee may delegate the performance of such functions as are necessary or
appropriate  for  it  to properly administer and construe the Plan to agents
including,  but  not limited to, appropriate officers of the Corporation. In
addition,  the  Compensation  Committee (directly or through its agents) may
retain  attorneys,  accountants  and  such other experts as are necessary or
appropriate to properly administer and construe the Plan.

       (c)     Expenses.  All  expenses  associated  with the establishment,
maintenance and termination of this Plan shall be borne by the Company.

12.    MISCELLANEOUS

       (a)     Shareholder  Approval.  The effectiveness of this Plan and of
any  amendment  hereto  is  subject  to  shareholder approval, to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, 16b-3 Rules.

<PAGE>

       (b)     Recordkeeping  and  Benefit Statements. Accurate and detailed
records  of  all  transactions under this Plan shall be kept by the Corpora-
tion.  Within  ninety (90) days following the close of each Plan Year during
which  an  individual  is  a Participant, the Corporation shall issue to the
Participant  a  statement  showing  the amounts allocated to the subaccounts
within  that  Participant's  Account  as of the close of such Plan Year, the
percentage vested, and other appropriate information.

       (c)     Value  of  Shares.  When, for allocation, distribution or any
other  purpose, it is necessary to determine the value of shares of Stock as
of a particular date, the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange as of
that  date  (or  as  of  the last date that the shares were actively traded)
shall be used.

       (d)     Effectiveness  of  Elections, Other Notices. To be effective,
any election by a Participant hereunder must be completed in full, signed by
the Participant and submitted to the Secretary. Any election or other notice
hereunder  shall  be  effective  when delivery occurs, if hand delivered, or
when properly postmarked, if mailed.

       (e)     Severability.  Any  provision  of this Plan prohibited by law
shall  be ineffective to the extent of any such prohibition, without invali-
dating the remaining provisions thereof.

       (f)     Governing  Law.  This Plan shall be governed by and construed
in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Maryland other than the
conflicts of laws rules thereof.

Stockholders on August 23, 1993]

                           EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

1.      PREAMBLE

This  Executive  Deferred Compensation Plan enables designated executives of
the  Corporation  to  defer  voluntarily  the  receipt of compensation until
retirement  or  other  termination  of employment.  It also enables any such
designated  executive  who is limited under the terms of the PHH Corporation
Employee  Investment  Plan  from  contributing  the  maximum salary deferral
contributions  permissible under section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code
to  receive  a credit hereunder equal to any matching contributions that the
Corporation  would  have contributed to the Employee Investment Plan for the
account of such executive, but for such limitation. 

The  Plan is unfunded and is maintained by the Corporation primarily for the
purpose  of  providing  deferred  compensation  for a select group of highly
compensated  employees.    As  such,  the  Plan  is  exempt  from  Part  2
(participation  and  funding),  Part  3  (funding)  and  Part  4  (fiduciary
responsibility)  of  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and
is  subject  to  limited reporting and disclosure rules under Part 1 of such

         3.      PARTICIPATION

                (a) Commencement. The  Participants  in  the  Plan as of the
                 Effective  Date  shall  be  those  executives designated in
                 Appendix  A attached hereto.  From time to time, and in its
                 sole  discretion, the Committee may amend Appendix A to add
                 or  delete  executives,  effective  as  of  such date as is
                 specified  by  the Committee; provided that the addition of
                 any executive of the Corporation does not cause the Plan to
                 fail  to be a "top hat" plan, as that term is defined under
                 ERISA.  
                          
                 (b) Termination. Deferral of compensation under the Plan may
                 continue as to any participant until the earliest of any of
                 the  following:    (i)  he  or  she  terminates  his or her
                 Optional Deferral Election pursuant to the terms hereof, in
                 which  event such deferral shall terminate effective at the
                 end  of  the  Plan  Year in which the termination notice is
                 received; (ii) the Committee amends Appendix A to eliminate
                 the  Participant;  or (iii) the date the Participant ceases
                 to  be  an active employee of the Corporation.  Termination
                 of  deferrals under this Section 3(b) shall create no right
                 to distribution unless otherwise provided under this Plan.

         4.       OPTIONAL DEFERRALS

         (a)     General  Rule.    In accordance with such Optional Deferral
Election  form(s)  as approved by Committee, and subject to such limitations
as  the  Committee may impose with respect to any Participant, a Participant
may make an Optional Deferral Election with respect to all or any portion of
his  or her Compensation for the Plan Year or partial Plan Year to which the
Optional Deferral Election relates.  Optional deferrals shall be credited to
the  Participant's  Account  as  of  each  date  Compensation  subject to an
Optional  Deferral Election otherwise would be payable.  A Participant shall
be  100  percent vested in the portion of his or her Account attributable to
optional deferrals at all times.   

         (b)     Time  of  Optional  Deferral Election.  To be effective for
any Plan Year, an Optional Deferral Election form to defer Compensation must
be received by the Committee prior to January 1 of the Plan Year to which it
relates.    However,  if an individual becomes a Participant on or after the
Effective Date and on a date other than January 1, the individual may submit
an  Optional  Deferral  Election  form for the remainder of the Plan Year in
which he or she becomes a Participant if the form is submitted within thirty
(30) days after becoming a Participant; provided, however, that the Optional
Deferral  Election  shall  apply only to Compensation relating to the period
following the date the Optional Deferral Election is submitted.

         (c)     Optional Deferral Election Irrevocable.  Once submitted, an
Optional  Deferral  Election  is  irrevocable  for the Plan Year to which it
applies.                                        3

<PAGE>


         (d)     Continuing  Effectiveness  of  Optional Deferral Elections.
Once submitted, a Participant's Optional Deferral Election shall continue in
effect  for  subsequent  Plan  Years  unless  the  Participant submits a new
Optional  Deferral  Election  form in accordance with the terms of this Plan
and  such  administrative rules and policy as the Committee shall establish,
or  unless,  pursuant  to  Section 3(b) hereof, the Participant is no longer
permitted  to  defer.    Notwithstanding  the  above,  and  subject  to such
administrative  rules as are established by the Committee, a Participant may
change  the apportionment of his or her Optional Deferral Election among the
Investment Funds.
                                                                             
         5.       MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS RELATING TO EMPLOYEE INVESTMENT PLAN

         (a)     General  Rule.  For any Plan Year in which a Participant is
limited  under  the  terms of the Employee Investment Plan from contributing
the  maximum  salary deferral contributions permissible under section 402(g)
of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  a  Participant shall have credited to his
Account  the amount of any matching contributions the Corporation would have
credited to the Participant's account under the Employee Investment Plan but
for  such  limitation; provided that the Participant has made to the Plan an
optional deferral in the amount to be matched.  Matching contributions shall
be  credited to a Participant's Account as of the dates they would have been
credited  under  the  Employee  Investment  Plan.   This provision shall not
affect any limitations on benefits imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

                 The  following  example  illustrates  the  effect  of  this
Section:    Assume the Corporation meets its Employee Investment Plan profit
targets  and  makes,  under  the  Employee  Investment Plan, a 100% Matching
Contribution  on the first 3% of deferrals and 100% Matching Contribution on
the  second  3%  of  deferrals  so  that  all  deferrals  under the Employee
Investment  Plan  up to 6% are matched.  Assume further that the Participant
has  Compensation  in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)
limits  ($150,000  as  indexed).  If the Participant contributes the maximum
amount  (6%)  permitted  to  be deferred under the Employee Investment Plan,
$9,000  of  his  deferrals  ($150,000 x 6%) would be subject to the base and
profit  share Matching Contributions under the Employee Investment Plan.  If
the  Participant  had  been  limited  to  contributing 5% under the Employee
Investment Plan ($7,500), the base Matching Contribution would be $4,500 and
the profit share Matching Contribution would be $3,000, for a total Matching
Contribution  under  the  Employee  Investment  Plan  of  $7,500.    If  the
Participant  had  contributed  the excluded 1% or $1,500 ($9,000 match limit
minus  the  $7,500  limit  imposed  by  the  Corporation  under the Employee
Investment Plan) under this Plan, a match of $1,500



                                      4

<PAGE>

($9,000  Matching  Contribution  at 6% less the $7,500 Matching Contribution
made  under the Employee Investment Plan) would be made to the Participant's
Account under this Plan.

         (b)     Vesting.   A Participant shall become vested in the portion
of  his  or her Account attributable to matching contributions in accordance
with  the vesting schedule applicable to Company Accounts under the Employee
Investment  Plan;  provided  that such matching contributions are subject to
forfeiture under the events set forth in Section 10 hereof.

         6.       ACCOUNTS

         (a)     General.    An  Account shall be established in the name of
each Participant.  Within each Account, there shall be two sub-accounts, one
reflecting a Participant's interests attributable to optional deferrals made
pursuant  to  Section  4, and the other reflecting a Participant's interests
attributable to matching contributions made pursuant to Section 5.

         (b)     Hypothetical  Investment.   For purposes of determining the
value  of  a  Participant's Account, it shall be assumed that:  (i) optional
deferrals credited to the Participant's Account under Section 4 are invested
in the Investment Funds in accordance with the Participant's instructions as
set  forth in the election form approved by the Committee; and (ii) matching
contributions  under  Section  5 are invested in the money market Investment
Fund or in such other Investment Fund as the Committee shall determine.  The
Participant's Account shall be credited on a daily basis with the investment
gain  or  loss that would have been credited to his or her account under the
Employee  Investment  Plan,  had  the  amounts credited to the Participant's
Account instead been contributed to the Employee Investment Plan. 

         (c)     Value  of  Account.   Whenever it is necessary to determine
the  value  of  a Participant's Account, the value as of the day immediately
preceding the date the determination is being made shall be used.  

         (d)     Bookkeeping  Account  Only.    The Account established in a
Participant's name is for bookkeeping purposes only.  It is the intention of
the  parties  that  the  Plan  and  any trust hereunder, and any Account, be
unfunded  for  purposes  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  and  the Employee
Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974  and that benefits shall be paid
solely from the general assets of the Corporation.  

                                    5

<PAGE> 
         (e)     Unsecured  Creditors.    Participants in this Plan have the
status of unsecured creditors of the Corporation, and the Plan constitutes a
mere  unsecured  promise  by the Corporation to make benefit payments in the
future.

         (f)     Trust or Other Vehicles.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
assist  it  in  meeting  its  obligations  hereunder,  the  Corporation  may
establish  a  grantor  trust  or  custodial  account,  purchase  one or more
insurance  policies,  or use any other vehicle that it deems appropriate for
such  purpose;  provided,  however,  that  no  such vehicle shall be for the
benefit  of, or cause amounts to be set aside for the benefit of, any one or
group of Participants.  

         7.       DISTRIBUTIONS

         (a)     Distributable  Event.    Subject  to  subsection  (b),  a
Participant  (or his Designated Beneficiary(ies)) shall become entitled to a
distribution  under the Plan upon the date the Participant ceases employment
with the Corporation for any reason; provided that the Committee may, in its
sole discretion, defer payment of such distribution until any date up to the
later  of  (i)  such  time  as  the  Participant ceases to be subject to any
reporting  requirements  as  to his or her compensation under the Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934,  or  (ii) such time as the Participant ceases to be
classified  as an executive officer, the deductibility of whose compensation
by  the  Corporation is limited under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code.  

         (b)     Commencement  of  Distribution.    Distribution  to  a
Participant  of  his  or her vested interest shall be made or commence as of
such  date  specified  in  the  last  Payment Election form submitted by the
Participant; provided, however, that no change in a Payment Election will be
effective  unless  it  has  been  made  at  least  twelve (12) months before
distribution  would  have  been  made or begun in the absence of the change.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, actual distributions of a Participant's lump
sum  or  initial  installment  payment  may  be deferred for a period not in
excess  of  sixty  (60)  days  following  the  date  a  lump  sum or initial
installment  becomes payable, without the requirement to pay any interest or
other amount on account of the deferral.

         (c)     Form of Distribution.  Distribution either may be made in a
lump  sum  or  in  monthly, quarterly or annual installments for a period of
time not to exceed ten (10) years, as specified in the last Payment Election
form  submitted  by  the Participant; provided, however, that no change in a
Payment  Election  will be effective unless it has been made at least twelve
(12) months before distribution would have been made or begun in the absence
of  such  a  change.   If distributions are made in installments, investment
gain  and loss shall continue to be credited in accordance with 

                                      6


<PAGE>

Section 6(b) hereof  until  complete distribution has been made.  All 
distributions shall be made in cash.

         (d)     Death.   If a Participant dies before receiving 100 percent
of  his  or  her  vested  interest,  the unpaid balance of the Participant's
Account  shall  become  100  percent  vested  and  shall  be paid as soon as
practicable  after death to the Participant's Designated Beneficiary(ies) in
the  form  (lump  sum  or  installments)  as  specified  in the last Payment
Election  Form  submitted  by  the Participant; provided that no change in a
Payment  Election  will be effective unless made at least twelve (12) months
before the Participant's death.

         (e)     Emergency  Distributions.    If  the Committee, in its sole
discretion,  determines  that  a  Participant  has incurred an unforeseeable
emergency  that would result in severe financial hardship to the Participant
if  a distribution from the Plan were not made, the Committee may distribute
to  the  Participant such portion of the Participant's Account as it, in its
sole discretion, determines is necessary to meet the emergency.  

         (f)     Acceleration  because of Taxable Event.   If the Committee,
in  its sole discretion, determines that a Participant has become subject to
income  tax  on all or any portion of his Account, the taxable portion shall
be distributed to the Participant.  

         8.       CLAIMS PROCEDURE

         (a)     I n i t i a l  Claim.    If  a  Participant  or  Designated
Beneficiary(ies)  (hereinafter referred to as a "Claimant") is denied all or
a  portion  of an expected benefit under this Plan for any reason, he or she
may  file  a claim with the Committee.  The Committee shall review the claim
itself  or  appoint  a  person  to  review  the claim. The Claimant shall be
notified  within sixty (60) days after his or her claim is filed whether the
claim  is  allowed  or  denied,  unless the Claimant receives written notice
prior  to  the  end  of  the  sixty  (60)  day  period  stating that special
circumstances  require an extension of the time for decision.  The notice of
the  decision shall be in writing, sent by mail to the Claimant's last known
address,  and,  if  a  denial  of  the  claim,  shall  contain the following
information:

                       (1)  the specific reasons for the denial;
                       (2)   specific reference to pertinent provisions of
                          the Plan on which the denial is based; and

<PAGE>
                                                   (3)    if  applicable,  a
                          description   of  any  additional  information  or
                          material   necessary  to  perfect  the  claim,  an
                          explanation  of why such information or material is
                          necessary,  and an explanation of the claims review
                          procedure.

         (b)     Review  Procedure.    A  Claimant  is entitled to request a
review  by the Committee of any denial of the Claimant's claim.  The request
for  review  must be submitted to the Committee in writing within sixty (60)
days of mailing of notice of the denial.  Absent a request for review within
the  sixty  (60)  day  period,  the  claim will be deemed to be conclusively
denied.    The  review  of  a  denial  of  a claim shall be conducted by the
Committee  or  an  individual  or  entity  appointed  by the Committee.  The
reviewer  shall  afford  the Claimant an opportunity to review all pertinent
documents  and  submit  issues  and  comments  in writing and shall render a
review  decision  in  writing, all within sixty (60) days after receipt of a
request  for a review, provided that, unless prohibited by law, the reviewer
may  extend  the  time  for  decision  by not more than sixty (60) days upon
written  notice  to the Claimant.  The Claimant shall receive written notice
of  the reviewer's decision, together with specific reasons for the decision
and reference to the pertinent provisions of the Plan.

         9.       CLAIMS AGAINST ACCOUNT

A Participant's rights to benefit payments under the Plan are not subject in
any  manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant, the
Participant's  Designated  Beneficiary(ies)  or  the  Participant's  estate.
Nothing contained in this Plan shall give any Participant or beneficiary any
interest,  lien or claim against any specific assets of the Corporation.  No
Participant  or  beneficiary  shall  have any rights other than as a general
creditor of the Corporation.

         10.      FORFEITURE OF RIGHT TO MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
         
Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Plan,  and at the sole and
absolute  discretion  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Corporation, a
Participant  will  forfeit  all  right  to  receive  matching  contributions
credited to his Account pursuant to Section 5 hereof and all investment gain
thereon  and  will be immediately obligated to return to the Corporation the
amount  of  any  such  matching  contributions previously distributed to the
Participant or other beneficiary if (a) such Participant, within a period of
two  years  from  the date his or her employment with the Corporation or its
affiliates  terminates,  directly  or  indirectly, either individually or as
owner,  partner,  agent,  employee,  consultant or otherwise, except for the
account  of  and  on  behalf  of  the  Corporation  or  an  affiliate of the
Corporation,  engages  in  any activity competitive with the business of the
Corporation  or  an affiliate of the Corporation, or in competition with the
Corporation  or  one  of  its  affiliates, solicits or otherwise attempts to
establish  for  himself  or herself or for any other person, firm or entity,
any  business  relationships with any person, firm or corporation which was,
at the time the Participant's employment terminates or within one year prior
thereto,  a  customer
                                       8

<PAGE>

of  the Corporation or one of its affiliates or (b) a
Participant's  employment  is  terminated  because  of willful misconduct or
gross  negligence  in the performance of his or her duties and the Committee
determines  in  its  sole  and  absolute  discretion  that  such  matching
contributions shall be forfeited.

If  Participant  is  determined  by  the Board of Directors, in its sole and
absolute  discretion,  to  have committed or threatened to commit an act set
forth  above,  the  Participant,  by  his  or  her  participation  herein,
acknowledges  that such act will cause irreparable injury to the Corporation
and  that  money  damages  alone  will not provide an adequate remedy to the
Corporation,  and  the  Board  of  Directors  may,  in its sole and absolute
discretion,  determine  that  the  Corporation  is entitled to an injunction
against   such  act  and  direct  the  appropriate  representatives  of  the
Corporation to seek such an injunction.

         1.      ADMINISTRATION

         (a)     General.   The Plan shall be administered by the Committee,
and  any  question  regarding  the  proper administration of the Plan or the
construction  of  any  term  hereof  shall  be  resolved  by it, in its sole
discretion.    The  Committee shall act by a majority of its members then in
office,  except  that  the  members thereof may authorize any one or more of
their  number  or  any  officer  of  the  Corporation to execute and deliver
documents  on  behalf of the Committee or otherwise to perform the duties of
the Committee.
                   
         (b)     Agents.  The Committee may delegate the performance of such
functions  as are necessary or appropriate for it to properly administer and
construe  the  Plan  to  agents  including,  but not limited to, appropriate
officers  of  the  Corporation  or  any  subcommittee  of the Committee.  In
addition,  the  Committee  (directly,  or  through  its  agents)  may retain
attorneys,   accountants,  and  such  other  experts  as  are  necessary  or
appropriate to properly administer and construe the Plan.

         (c)     Liability.    To  the  extent permitted by law, neither the
Committee,  nor  any  other  person performing duties under this Plan, shall
incur  any liability for any act done, determination made or failure to act,
if  in  good  faith,  and the Corporation shall indemnify the Committee, its
members  and  such  other  persons  against  any  and  all liability that is
incurred  as  a  result  of the good faith performance or non-performance of
their duties hereunder.  The Corporation may, but shall not be obligated to,
purchase  liability  insurance to protect such persons with respect to their
duties under the Plan.

         (d)     Expenses.    The  Corporation  shall  pay  all  expenses
associated with the establishment, maintenance and termination of this Plan.

                              9

<PAGE>
         12.     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

The  Board  of  Directors  may  amend, suspend or terminate this Plan at any
time,  in  any  manner  and  for  any  reason;  provided,  however,  that no
alteration,  amendment,  suspension,  termination  or  similar  action shall
reduce  or  impair the rights of a Participant accrued prior to such action.
To  the  extent permitted by law, the Board of Directors, in its discretion,
may  delegate  all  or  any  of  its  authority under this Section 12 to the
Committee.

         13.      MISCELLANEOUS

         (a)     Recordkeeping  and  Benefit  Statements.    The Corporation
shall  keep  accurate  and  detailed  records of all transactions under this
Plan.    Within  60  days  following  the close of each quarter of Plan Year
during  which an individual is a Participant, the Corporation shall issue to
the  Participant  a  statement  showing  the  amounts  allocated  to the sub
accounts  within  that Participant's Account as of the close of such quarter
of the Plan Year, the percentage vested, and other appropriate information. 

         (b)     Effectiveness  of  Optional  Deferral  Elections,  Other
Notices.    Any  Optional Deferral Election by a Participant under this Plan
must  either be completed in full, signed by the Participant and received by
the  Secretary or be made by telephonic instructions from the Participant to
the  extent  permitted under such administrative rules or policy as shall be
established by the Committee.  

         (c)     Limitation of Rights.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall
be construed to limit in any way the right of the Corporation to terminate a
Participant's  employment  at  any  time, or be evidence of any agreement or
understanding,  express or implied, that a Participant will be employed in a
particular position or at any particular rate of remuneration.

         (d)     Severability.  Any provision of this Plan prohibited by law
shall  be  ineffective  to  the  extent  of  any  such  prohibition, without
invalidating the Plan's remaining provisions.

         (d)     Applicable  State  Law.  To the extent not preempted by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, this Plan shall be governed
by,  and  construed  in  accordance  with, the laws of the State of Maryland
other than the conflicts of laws rules thereof.

         (e)     Construction.    This  Plan  shall  be  construed  and
administered  as  an  unfunded  plan maintained primarily for the purpose of
providing  deferred  compensation  to a select group of management or highly
compensated  employees,  as  those terms are used in the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.

[Approved by the Board of Directors on February 28, 1994]

       TRUST AGREEMENT, dated as of the 28th day of February, 1994, between
PHH Corporation, a Maryland corporation, having an office at 11333 McCormick

Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland 21031 (the "Sponsor"), and FIDELITY MANAGEMENT
TRUST COMPANY, a Massachusetts trust company, having an office at 82

Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109 (the "Trustee").


                                 WITNESSETH:


       WHEREAS, the Sponsor is the sponsor of the PHH Corporation Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"); and


       WHEREAS, the Sponsor wishes to establish an irrevocable trust and to

contribute to the trust assets that shall be held therein, subject to the
claims of Sponsor's creditors in the event of Sponsor's Insolvency, as

herein defined, until paid to Plan participants and their beneficiaries in
such manner and at such times as specified in the Plan; and


       WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall

constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the
Plan as an unfunded nonqualified plan maintained for the purpose of

providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"); and


       WHEREAS, it is the intention of the Sponsor to make contributions to
the trust to provide itself with a source of funds to assist it in the
meeting of its liabilities under the Plan; and


       WHEREAS, the Trustee is willing to hold and invest the aforesaid plan

assets in trust among several investment options selected by the Sponsor to
be allocated in a manner selected by the Sponsor; and


       WHEREAS, the Sponsor wishes to have the Trustee perform certain

ministerial recordkeeping and administrative functions under the Plan; and

                                      1

<PAGE>

       WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Sponsor's Board of
Directors (the "Administrator") is the administrator of the Plan; and

       WHEREAS, the Trustee is willing to perform recordkeeping and
administrative services for the Plan if the services are purely ministerial

in nature and are provided within a framework of plan provisions, guidelines
and interpretations conveyed in writing to the Trustee by the Administrator.

       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, the Sponsor and the Trustee

agree as follows:


Section 1.  Trust.
             (a)  Establishment.  The Sponsor hereby establishes the PHH

Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan Trust (the "Trust"), with
the Trustee.  The Trust shall consist of an initial contribution of money or

other property acceptable to the Trustee in its sole discretion, made by the
Sponsor or transferred from a previous trustee under the Plan, such

additional sums of money as shall from time to time be delivered to the
Trustee under the Plan, all investments made therewith and proceeds thereof,

and all earnings and profits thereon, less the payments that are made by the
Trustee as provided herein, without distinction between principal and

income.  The Trustee hereby accepts the Trust on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement.  In accepting this Trust, the Trustee shall be

accountable for the assets received by it, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.


             (b)  Grantor Trust.  The Trust is intended to be a grantor

trust, of which the Sponsor is the grantor, within the meaning of subpart E,
part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and shall be construed accordingly.


                  The Sponsor shall make irrevocable deposits of cash or

other property with the Trustee equal to deferrals under the Plan, and to
the Sponsor matching contributions under the Plan, as of such dates as made

to participant's accounts under the terms of the Plan.  If there is a
forfeiture of any portion of a participant's account pursuant to the Plan,

the Sponsor may offset subsequent deposits to the extent of assets of the
Trust attributable to such forfeiture.
                                     
                                       2
<PAGE>

             (c)  Trust Assets.  The principal of the Trust, and any

earnings thereon shall be held separate and apart from other funds of the
Sponsor and shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of Plan

participants and general creditors as herein set forth.  Plan participants
and their beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial

ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust.  Any rights created under
the Plan and this Trust Agreement shall be mere unsecured contractual rights

of Plan participants and their beneficiaries against the Sponsor.  Any
assets held by the Trust will be subject to the claims of the Sponsor's
general creditors under federal and state law in the event of Insolvency, as
defined in Section 13(a).


             (d)  Non-Assignment.  Benefit payments to Plan participants and

their beneficiaries funded under this Trust may not be anticipated, assigned
(either at law or in equity), alienated, pledged, encumbered, or subjected

to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution, or other legal or equitable
process.


             (e)  Change in Control.  Upon a Change of Control, the Sponsor

shall, as soon as possible but in no event later than 15 days following the
Change of Control, as defined herein, make an irrevocable contribution to

the Trust in an amount that will be sufficient to the Trust to pay the
benefits to which Plan participants or their beneficiaries would be entitled

pursuant to the terms of the Plan, as of the date on which the Change of
Control occurred.


Section 2.  Payments to Sponsor.  Except as provided under Section 13, the

Sponsor shall have no right to retain or divert to others any of the Trust
assets before all payment of benefits have been made to the participants and

their beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the Plan.


Section 3.  Disbursements.
             (a)  Directions from Administrator.  The Trustee shall disburse

monies to the Sponsor for benefit payments in the amounts that the
Administrator directs from time to time in writing.  The Trustee shall have

no responsibility to ascertain any direction's compliance with the terms of
the Plan or of any applicable law.  The Trustee shall not be responsible for

making benefit payments to participants under the Plan, nor shall the
Trustee be responsible for any Federal, State or local income tax reporting

or withholding with respect to such Plan benefits.
                                     3

<PAGE>

             (b)  Limitations.  The Trustee shall not be required to make
any disbursement in excess of the net realizable value of the assets of the

Trust at the time of the disbursement.  The Trustee shall not be required to
make any disbursement in cash unless the Administrator has provided a

written direction as to the assets to be converted to cash for the purpose
of making the disbursement.  Except as provided either in Section 13 hereof

(with respect to Insolvency of the Sponsor) or as provided in the Plan (with
respect to forfeiture of Sponsor matching contributions), and except as

necessary to satisfy the employee portion of FICA taxes due, the Sponsor
shall have no right or power to direct the Trustee to return to the Sponsor

or divert to others any of the Trust assets before all payment of benefits

have been made to Plan participants or their beneficiaries pursuant to the
terms of the Plan.


Section 4.  Investment of Trust.

             (a)  Selection of Investment Options.  The Trustee shall have
no responsibility for the selection of investment options under the Trust

and shall not render investment advice to any person in connection with the
selection of such options.


             (b)  Available Investment Options.  The Sponsor shall initially

direct the Trustee as to the investment options in which Trust assets shall
be invested, subject to the following limitations.  The Sponsor may

determine to use as investment options only securities issued by the
investment companies advised by Fidelity Management & Research Company

("Mutual Funds") identified on Schedules "A" attached hereto; provided,
however, that the Trustee shall not be considered a fiduciary with

investment discretion.  The Sponsor may add or delete investment options
upon mutual amendment of this Trust Agreement and the Schedule "A" thereto

to reflect such addition(s) or deletion(s).

             (c)  Investment Directions.  In order to provide for an
accumulation of assets comparable to the contractual liabilities accruing

under the Plan, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee in writing how to invest
the assets held in the Trust.  In accordance with the above, directions may

be provided directly by Plan participants with respect for their own account
under the Trust by use of the telephone exchange system maintained for such

purposes by the Trustee or its agent.  In the event that the Trustee fails
to receive a proper direction from the Sponsor or 

                                 4

<PAGE>

from Participants, the
assets in question shall be invested in Fidelity Retirement Money Market
Fund until the Trustee receives a proper direction.


             (d)  Mutual Funds.  The Sponsor hereby acknowledges that it has

received from the Trustee a copy of the prospectus for each Mutual Fund
selected by the Sponsor as a Plan investment option.  Trust investments in

Mutual Funds shall be subject to the following limitations:


                  (i)   Execution of Purchases and Sales.  Purchases and
sales of Mutual Funds (other than for Exchanges) shall be made on the date

on which the Trustee receives from the Sponsor in good order all information
and documentation necessary to accurately effect such purchases and sales

(or in the case of a purchase, the subsequent date on which the Trustee has

received a wire transfer of funds necessary to make such purchase). 
Exchanges of Mutual Funds shall be made on the same business day that the

Trustee receives a proper direction if received before 4:00 p.m. eastern
time; if the direction is received after 4:00 p.m. eastern time, the

exchange shall be made the following day.


                  (ii)  Voting.  At the time of mailing of notice of each
annual or special stockholders' meeting of any Mutual Fund, the Trustee

shall send a copy of the notice and all proxy solicitation materials to each
Plan participant who has shares of the Mutual Fund credited to the

participant's accounts under the Trust, together with a voting direction
form for return to the Trustee or its designee.  The participant shall have

the right to direct the Trustee as to the manner in which the Trustee is to
vote the shares credited to the participant's accounts (both vested and

unvested).  The Trustee shall vote the shares as directed by the
participant.  The Trustee shall not vote shares for which it has received no

directions from the participant.  With respect to all rights other than the
right to vote, the Trustee shall follow the directions of the participant

and if no such directions are received, the directions of the Sponsor.  The
Trustee shall have no additional duty to solicit directions from

participants or the Sponsor.


             (e)  Trustee Responsibility and Powers.  The Trustee shall act
with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then

prevailing that a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with
such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character

and with like aims.  The Trustee shall have the following powers and
authority:
                                   5

<PAGE>

                  (i)   Subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this

Section 4, to sell, exchange, convey, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any
property held in the Trust, by private contract or at public auction.  No

person dealing with the Trustee shall be bound to see to the application of
the purchase money or other property delivered to the Trustee or to inquire

into the validity, expediency, or propriety of any such sale or other
disposition.


                  (ii)  To cause any securities or other property held as

part of the Trust to be registered in the Trustee's own name, in the name of
one or more of its nominees, or in the Trustee's account with the Depository

Trust Company of New York and to hold any investments in bearer form, but
the books and records of the Trustee shall at all times show that all such

investments are part of the Trust.

                  (iii)                                   To keep that
portion of the Trust in cash or cash balances as the Sponsor or

Administrator may, from time to time, deem to be in the best interest of the
Trust.


                  (iv)  To make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and

all documents of transfer or conveyance and to carry out the powers herein
granted.


                  (v) To settle, compromise, or submit to arbitration any

claims, debts, or damages due to or arising from the Trust; to commence or
defend suits or legal or administrative proceedings; to represent the Trust

in all suits and legal and administrative hearings; and to pay all
reasonable expenses arising from any such action, from the Trust if not paid

by the Sponsor.


                  (vi) To employ legal, accounting, clerical, and other
assistance as may be required in carrying out the provisions of this

Agreement and to pay their reasonable expenses and compensation from the
Trust if not paid by the Sponsor.


                  (vii) To do all other acts although not specifically
mentioned herein, as the Trustee may deem necessary to carry out any of the

foregoing powers and the purposes of the Trust.

                                       6

             Notwithstanding any powers granted to Trustee pursuant to this
Trust Agreement or to applicable law, Trustee shall not have any power that

could give this Trust the objective of carrying on a business and dividing
the gains therefrom, within the meaning of Section 301.7701-2 of the

Procedure and Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant to the
Internal Revenue Code.  The Sponsor shall provide the Trustee with an

opinion of counsel whether an annual fiduciary tax return should be filed
for the Trust; in the absence of such opinion, Trustee may consult with

counsel to the extent it deems appropriate on this issue, and any resulting
counsel fees shall be charged to the Trust to the extent not paid by the
Sponsor.


Section 5.  Recordkeeping and Administrative Services to Be Performed.
             (a)  General.  The Trustee shall perform those recordkeeping

and administrative functions described in  Schedule "A" attached hereto. 
These recordkeeping and administrative functions shall be performed within
the framework of the Administrator's written directions regarding the Plan's
provisions, guidelines and interpretations.


             (b)  Accounts.  The Trustee shall keep accurate accounts of all

investments, receipts, disbursements, and other transactions hereunder, and
shall report the value of the assets held for the account of each

participant in the Trust as of the last day of each calendar quarter of the
Plan and, if not on the last day of a calendar quarter, the date on which

the Trustee resigns or is removed as provided in Section 8 of this Agreement
or is terminated as provided in Section 10 (the "Reporting Date").  Within

thirty (30) days following each Reporting Date or within sixty (60) days in
the case of a Reporting Date caused by the resignation or removal of the

Trustee, or the termination of this Agreement, the Trustee shall file with
the Administrator a written account setting forth all investments, receipts,

disbursements, and other transactions effected by the Trustee between the
Reporting Date and the prior Reporting Date, and setting forth the value of

the Trust as of the Reporting Date.  Except as otherwise required under
applicable law, upon the expiration of one year from the date of filing such

account with the Administrator, the Trustee shall have no liability or
further accountability to anyone with respect to the propriety of its acts

or transactions shown in such account, except with respect to such acts or


transactions as to which the Sponsor shall within such one year period file
with the Trustee written objections, and except in the case of gross

negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee.

                                   7

             (c)  Inspection and Audit.  All records generated by the
Trustee in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be open to

inspection and audit, during the Trustee's regular business hours prior to
the termination of this Agreement, by the Administrator or any person

designated by the Administrator.  Upon the resignation or removal of the
Trustee or the termination of this Agreement, the Trustee shall provide to

the Administrator, at no expense to the Sponsor, in the format regularly
provided to the Administrator, a statement of each participant's accounts as

of the resignation, removal, or termination, and the Trustee shall provide
to the Administrator or the Plan's new recordkeeper such further records as

are reasonable, at the Sponsor's expense.


             (d)  Effect of Plan Amendment.  The Trustee's provision of the
recordkeeping and administrative services set forth in this Section 5 shall

be conditioned on the Sponsor delivering to the Trustee a copy of any
amendment to the Plan as soon as administratively feasible following the

amendment's adoption, and on the Administrator providing the Trustee on a

timely basis with all the information the Administrator deems necessary for
the Trustee to perform the recordkeeping and administrative services and

such other information as the Trustee may reasonably request.


             (e)  Returns, Reports and Information.  The Administrator shall
be responsible for the preparation and filing of all returns, reports, and

information required of the Trust or Plan by law.  The Trustee shall provide
the Administrator with such information as the Administrator may reasonably

request to make these filings.  The Administrator shall also be responsible
for making any disclosures to participants required by law.


Section 6.  Compensation and Expenses.  Within thirty (30) days of receipt

of the Trustee's bill, which shall be computed and billed in accordance with
Schedule "B" attached hereto and made a part hereof, as amended from time to

time, the Sponsor shall send to the Trustee a payment in such amount or the
Sponsor may direct the Trustee to deduct such amount from participants'

accounts.  All expenses of the Trustee relating directly to the acquisition
and disposition of investments constituting part of the Trust, and all taxes

of any kind whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or
future laws upon or in respect of the Trust or the income thereof, shall be

a charge against and paid from the appropriate Plan participants' accounts.

Section 7.  Directions and Indemnification.
             (a)  Identity of Administrator.  The Trustee shall be fully

protected in relying on the fact that the Administrator under the Plan is
the individual or persons named as such above or such other individuals or

persons as the Sponsor may notify the Trustee in writing.  The Administrator
may from time to time delegate to others its authority to provide directions

to the Trustee hereunder, and the Trustee shall be fully protected in
relying upon directions by any such person provided that the Administrator

has informed the Trustee and Sponsor in writing of such delegation.


             (b)  Directions from Administrator.  Whenever the Administrator
provides a direction to the Trustee, the Trustee shall not be liable for any

loss, or by reason of any breach, arising from the direction if the
direction is contained in a writing (or is oral and immediately confirmed in

a writing) signed by any individual whose name and signature have been
submitted (and not withdrawn) in writing to the Trustee by the Administrator

in the form attached hereto as Schedule "C", provided the Trustee reasonably
believes the signature of the individual to be genuine.  Such direction may

be made via EDT in accordance with procedures agreed to by the Administrator
and the Trustee; provided, however, that the Trustee shall be fully

protected in relying on such direction as if it were a direction made in

writing by the Administrator.  The Trustee shall have no responsibility to
ascertain any direction's (i) accuracy, (ii) compliance with the terms of

the Plan or any applicable law, or (iii) effect for tax purposes or
otherwise.


             (c)  Directions from Participants.  The Trustee shall not be

liable for any loss which arises from any participant's exercise or non-
exercise of rights under this Section 4 over the assets in the participant's

accounts.


             (d)  Indemnification.  The Sponsor shall indemnify the Trustee
against, and hold the Trustee harmless from, any and all loss, damage,

penalty, liability, cost, and expense, including without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, that may be incurred by,

imposed upon, or asserted against the Trustee by reason of any claim,
regulatory proceeding, or litigation arising from any act done or omitted to

be done by any individual or person with respect

                                    9

<PAGE>

to the Plan or Trust,
excepting only any and all loss, etc., arising solely from the Trustee's
negligence or bad faith.

             (e)  Survival.  The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.


Section 8.  Resignation or Removal of Trustee.

             (a)  Resignation.  The Trustee may resign at any time upon
sixty (60) days' notice in writing to the Sponsor, unless a shorter period

of notice is agreed upon by the Sponsor.


             (b)  Removal.  The Sponsor may remove the Trustee at any time
upon sixty (60) days' notice in writing to the Trustee, unless a shorter

period of notice is agreed upon by the Trustee.


             (c)  Upon a Change of Control.  Upon a Change of Control, as
defined herein, the Trustee may not be removed by the Sponsor for a period

of one year unless seventy-five percent (75%) of the number of participants
in the Plan (or their surviving beneficiaries, as the case may be) consent

in writing to the removal of the Trustee and the identity of the successor
Trustee.  If the Trustee resigns within one year following a Change of

Control, as defined herein, the choice of the successor Trustee shall be
subject to the condition that seventy-five percent (75%) of the number of

participants in the Plan (or their surviving beneficiaries, as the case may

be) consent in writing to the identity of the successor Trustee.  The
purpose of these provisions is to ensure that, following a Change of

Control, the Trust continues to be administered for the purpose of providing
benefits to the participants and beneficiaries covered by the Plan.


                  For purposes of this Trust, the term "Change of Control"

shall mean the earlier to occur of either of the following events:  (1) a
third person, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, becomes the beneficial owner of shares of
the Company having 20% or more of the total number of votes that may be cast

for the election of directors of the Sponsor, or (ii) as the result of, or
in connection with, any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other

business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any
combination of the foregoing transactions (a "Transaction"), the persons who

were directors

                                  10

<PAGE>

of the Sponsor before the Transaction cease to constitute a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Sponsor or any successor to the

Sponsor.  Unless the Trustee has actual knowledge of a Change in Control,
the Trustee shall have no duty to inquire whether a Change in Control has

occurred unless it has received notice from the Sponsor of a Change in
Control.


             (d)  Transfer of Trust Assets.  Upon the resignation or removal
of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee, all assets shall

subsequently be transferred to the successor Trustee.  The transfer shall be
completed within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice or resignation,

removal or transfer, unless the Sponsor extends the time limit.


Section 9.  Successor Trustee.
             (a)  Appointment.  If the office of Trustee becomes vacant for

any reason, the Sponsor may in writing appoint a successor trustee under
this Agreement.  The successor trustee shall have all of the rights, powers,

privileges, obligations, duties, liabilities, and immunities granted to the
Trustee under this Agreement.  The successor trustee and predecessor trustee

shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of the other with respect to
the Trust.


             (b)  Acceptance.  When the successor trustee accepts its

appointment under this Agreement, title to and possession of the Trust
assets shall immediately vest in the successor trustee without any further

action on the part of the predecessor trustee.  The predecessor trustee
shall execute all instruments and do all acts that reasonably may be

necessary or reasonably may be requested in writing by the Sponsor or the


successor trustee to vest title to all Trust assets in the successor trustee
or to deliver all Trust assets to the successor trustee.


             (c)  Corporate Action.  Any successor of the Trustee or

successor trustee, through sale or transfer of the business or trust
department of the Trustee or successor trustee, or through reorganization,

consolidation, or merger, or any similar transaction, shall, upon
consummation of the transaction, become the successor trustee under this

Agreement.


Section 10.  Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time by
the Sponsor upon sixty (60) days' notice in writing to the Trustee.  On the

date of the termination of this Agreement, the Trustee shall forthwith
transfer and deliver to such individual or entity as the Sponsor shall

                                      11

<PAGE>


designate, all cash and assets then constituting the Trust.  If, by the
termination date, the Sponsor has not notified the Trustee in writing as to

whom the assets and cash are to be transferred and delivered, the Trustee
may bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the

assets and cash in a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Trustee shall be
reimbursed by the Sponsor for all costs and expenses of the action or

proceeding including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements.


Section 11.  Resignation, Removal, and Termination Notices.  All notices of

resignation, removal, or termination under this Agreement must be in writing
and mailed to the party to which the notice is being given by certified or

registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Sponsor c/o Ms. Patricia
Muncy, Manager, Retirement Planning and Operations, PHH Corporation, 11333

McCormick Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland 21031, and to the Trustee c/o John M.
Kimpel, Fidelity Investments, 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts

02109, or to such other addresses as the parties have notified each other of
in the foregoing manner.


Section 12.  Duration.  This Trust shall continue in effect without limit as

to time, subject, however, to the provisions of this Agreement relating to
amendment, modification, and termination thereof.


Section 13.    Insolvency of Sponsor.

              (a)  Trustee shall cease disbursement of funds for payment of
benefits to Plan participants and their beneficiaries if the Sponsor is

Insolvent.  Sponsor shall be considered "Insolvent" for purposes of this


Trust Agreement if (i) Sponsor is unable to pay its debts as they become
due, or (ii) Sponsor is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under

the United States Bankruptcy Code.


              (b)  All times during the continuance of this Trust, the
principal and income of the Trust shall be subject to claims of general

creditors of the Sponsor under federal and state law as set forth below.


                   (i)  The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive
Officer of the Sponsor shall have the duty to inform Trustee in writing of

Sponsor's Insolvency.  If a person claiming to be a 

                                        12

<PAGE>


creditor of the Sponsor
alleges in writing to Trustee that Sponsor has become Insolvent, Trustee

shall determine whether Sponsor is Insolvent and, pending such
determination, Trustee shall discontinue disbursements for payment of

benefits to Plan participants or their beneficiaries.


                   (ii)                                   Unless Trustee has
actual knowledge of Sponsor's Insolvency, or has received notice from

Sponsor or a person claiming to be a creditor alleging that Company is
Insolvent, Trustee shall have no duty to inquire whether Sponsor is

Insolvent.  Trustee may in all events rely on such evidence concerning


Sponsor's solvency as may be furnished to Trustee and that provides Trustee
with a reasonable basis for making a determination concerning Sponsor's

solvency.


                   (iii)                                  If any time
Trustee has determined that Sponsor is Insolvent, Trustee shall discontinue

disbursements for payments to Plan participants or their beneficiaries and
shall hold the assets of the Trust for the benefit of Sponsor's general

creditors.  Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish any
rights of Plan participants or their beneficiaries to pursue their rights as

general creditors of Sponsor with respect to benefits due under the Plan or
otherwise.


                   (iv)                                   Trustee shall

resume disbursement for the payment of benefits to Plan participants or
their beneficiaries in accordance with Section 2 of this Trust Agreement

only after Trustee has determined that Sponsor is not Insolvent (or is no
longer Insolvent).


              (c)  Provided that there are sufficient assets, if Trustee

discontinues the payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant to (a) hereof



and subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such
discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due to

Plan participants or their beneficiaries under the terms of the Plan for the
period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate amount of any payments

made to Plan participants or their beneficiaries by Sponsor is lieu of the
payments provided for hereunder during any such period of discontinuance.


Section 14.  Amendment or Modification.  This Agreement may be amended or

modified at any time and from time to time only by an instrument executed by
both the Sponsor and the Trustee.  

                                         13

<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to reflect

increased operating costs the Trustee may once each calendar year amend
Schedule "B" without the Sponsor's consent upon seventy-five (75) days'

written notice to the Sponsor; provided that no such increase shall occur
within the first year of this Agreement.


Section 15.  General.

               (a)  Performance by Trustee, its Agents or Affiliates.  The
Sponsor acknowledges and authorizes that the services to be provided under

this Agreement shall be provided by the Trustee, its agents or affiliates,
including Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company or its

successor, and that certain of such services may be provided pursuant to one
or more other contractual agreements or relationships.


               (b)  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement contains all of the

terms agreed upon between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

               (c)  Waiver.  No waiver by either party of any failure or
refusal to comply with an obligation hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of

any other or subsequent failure or refusal to so comply.


               (d)  Successors and Assigns.  The stipulations in this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall bind, the successors and

assigns of the respective parties.


               (e)  Partial Invalidity.  If any term or provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall,

to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement,
or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances

other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not
be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be

valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.


               (f)  Section Headings.  The headings of the various sections
and subsections of this Agreement have been inserted only for the purposes

of convenience and are not part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed in
any manner to modify, explain, expand or restrict any of the provisions of

                          PHH CORPORATION
                 CORPORATE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN         
                           FY 1995-96-97          

The purpose of this plan is to encourage the achievement of the long-term
objectives of PHH Corporation and its shareholders, by providing incentive
opportunities to designated senior key executives.

DEFINITIONS
A) The "Company" shall mean PHH Corporation, or its successor in interest.

B)  The "term" shall mean the term of this plan which shall be the three
fiscal years, beginning May 1, 1994 through April 30, 1997

C)  "Return on beginning equity (ROBE)" shall mean the Company's annual net
income after taxes, after giving effect for any incentive to be paid,
computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
divided by the beginning shareholders' equity for the fiscal year.  The
performance measure for the plan shall be the average of the ROBE results
for each of the three fiscal years in the plan.  Determination of the
performance measure results shall be made by the Committee following the
close of fiscal 1997.

D)  The "Board of Directors" shall mean the Board of Directors of PHH
Corporation.

E) The "Committee" shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors.

F) The "Chairman & CEO" shall mean the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of
PHH Corporation.


PARTICIPATION AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS
Participation in the plan is limited to key senior executives of the Company
specifically designated by the Chairman & CEO and approved by the Committee. 
None of the members of the Committee may participate in the plan.  Initially
designated participants must be actively employed as of May 1, 1994 in order
to be eligible to receive any incentive under the plan.  Except as otherwise
determined by the Committee pursuant to the plan, additional participants
may be approved prior to May 1, 1995, to be considered for a prorated award,
based on their service during the plan term.  Incentive targets for the
designated participants shall be determined by the Committee at the
beginning of the plan term.  No participant has any vested rights or
interest under the plan and must be actively employed as of April 30, 1997
or have terminated employment by reason of retirement, death or disability
(as determined by the Committee) during the term to be eligible for any
incentive payment under the plan.

In the discretion of the Committee, awards may be granted in relation to a
non qualified stock option granted under the Amended and Restated Stock
Compensation Plan of 1990 of the Company ("Stock Compensation Plan"), in
which event, at the end of the term, a participant shall make a written
election either to receive payment of the award or to retain the related non
qualified stock option.  Awards granted in relation to non qualified stock
options shall be canceled, to the extent determined in the discretion of the
Committee, (i) if the related non qualified stock option is exercised prior
to the end of the term or (ii) if at the end of the term, the participant
elects to retain the related non qualified stock option.

FY 1995-96-97 CORPORATE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Page 2


COMPANY PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Exhibit A sets forth the ROBE results which the Committee determines must be
obtained in order for the corresponding percentage of the target incentive
to be payable to participants.  The performance measure is the average of
the ROBE results for each of the three fiscal years of the term.  In
determining whether ROBE targets have been met, the Committee may take into
account one time charges or other factors, if any, as it deems relevant. 
The aggregate incentive amounts which may be paid out for the designated
participants under the plan are set forth on Exhibit A, including the
maximum amounts which may be paid out for the designated participants under
the plan.  Failure to meet the minimum ROBE results will result in no
payment to the participant.


INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
Payments of individual incentive amounts, if any, will be made following the
determination of the ROBE results by the Committee.  At the determination of
the Committee, payment may be made in cash and/or in shares of Common Stock
of the Company awarded pursuant to the Stock Compensation Plan.  A
participant may elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of any incentive
payment as provided in the form of Deferral Election approved from time to
time by the Committee.  Such deferral election must be made by the
participant in accordance with applicable deferred compensation plans
established by the Company and in a manner consistent with federal, state
and local tax laws.

ADMINISTRATION
The plan, adopted by the Board of Directors, shall be administered by the
Committee.  The Committee is authorized to promulgate rules relating to
administration of the plan and to make determinations with respect thereto.

The Company shall have the right to deduct from all awards paid under the
plan all federal, state, local and other taxes required by law to be
withheld with respect to such payments.

Where a "change of control" (as defined in the Company's Stock Compensation
Plan) occurs during the term, the Company shall pay to participants an
incentive under the plan based on ROBE results up until such date of such
change of control as if such ROBE result constituted the three-year average
ROBE result provided for herein multiplied by the fraction, the denominator
of which shall be thirty-six (36) months and the numerator of which shall be
that number of full months elapsed from the beginning of the term up until
such date.  If a change of control occurs after the term, all incentive
payments which the participant had elected to defer under the terms of any
unfunded deferred compensation plan established by the company shall be
either contributed in full by the Company under any such deferred
compensation plan trust or, if no such trust has been established, paid in
full by the Company as soon as practicable following the change of control.





In case of separations from the Company for the following reasons, the
following provisions will apply.
 
Retirement, Death or Disability - Awards will be prorated based on the
nearest full quarter of the fiscal year of active employment.  The incentive
award payment will be made following the end of the term of the plan after
full-term results are known.  Disability will be defined in the same manner
as provided in qualified plan provisions in effect at the time of
disability.

FY 1995-96-97 CORPORATE  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Page 3


Voluntary Resignation - Awards will be forfeited when executives voluntarily
resign before the end of the term.

Termination or other Resignation - Awards, if any, will be made as
determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.

No member of the Board of Directors or the Committee nor any officer,
employee or agent of the Company shall have any liability to any person
based on or arising out of the plan, absent bad faith or willful misconduct.

Nothing contained in the plan, and no action taken pursuant to its
provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a
fiduciary relationship between the Company and any participant, beneficiary,
legal representative or any other person.  To the extent that any person
acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the plan, such
right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of
the Company.  All payment to be made hereunder shall be paid from the
general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be
established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of
such amounts.

REVISION OR CANCELLATION OF THE PLAN
Nothing in the plan shall be deemed to create any rights of participation of
any employee.  The Committee shall have the full authority in its sole
discretion to unilaterally modify, terminate or cancel the plan, in whole or
in part, or with respect to any designated participant, at any time without
liability to any participant.

NON-TRANSFERABILITY
A participant may not assign, sell, encumber, transfer or otherwise dispose
of any rights or interests under the plan and any attempted disposition
shall be null and void.

PAGE 2

COMPANY PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Exhibit A sets forth the Company ROBE results which must be obtained in
order for the corresponding percentage of the Target Incentive to be payable
to participants.  In determining whether ROBE targets have been met, the
Committee may take into account one time charges or other factors, if any,
as it deems relevant.  Incentive payouts under this plan are contingent upon
achievement of the Company's stated leverage target in effect at the close
of FY 1995.  The aggregate incentive amounts which may be paid out under the
plan are designated by the Chairman & CEO and approved by the Committee.

PAYMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE AMOUNTS
The determination of the total available incentive amount, if any, which
might be paid to any plan participant, shall be determined by the Chairman &
CEO and approved by the Committee in its sole discretion following the close
of FY 1995 and shall be based upon the achievement of the related ROBE
result as shown on Exhibit A and the achievement of individual performance
objectives as identified at the beginning of the plan year.  Payment of the
portion of the incentive target recognizing individual performance is
contingent upon achievement of the threshold corporate net income (net of
incentive plan funding).

No participant has any vested interest in the plan and must be actively
employed as of April 30, 1995 to be eligible for incentive award
distribution.  A participant may elect to defer receipt of all or a portion
of any incentive payment as provided in the form of Deferral Elections
approved from time to time by the Committee.  Such deferral election must be
made by the participant in accordance with applicable deferred compensation
plans and in a manner consistent with applicable federal, state and local
tax laws.

ADMINISTRATION
The plan adopted by the Committee shall be administered by the Chairman &
CEO.  The Chairman & CEO is authorized to promulgate rules relating to
administration of the plan and to make determinations with respect thereto,
including any discretionary cash payments in excess of available incentive
amounts calculated hereunder.

If a "change of control" (as defined in the Company's Stock Compensation
Plan) occurs after the term, all incentive payments which the participant
had elected to defer under the terms of any unfunded deferred compensation
plan established by the company shall be either contributed in full by the
Company under any such deferred compensation plan or, if no such trust has
been established, paid in full by the Company as soon as practicable
following the "change of control".

REVISION OR CANCELLATION OF THE PLAN
This Corporate Incentive Plan shall not create any rights of future
participation therein of any employee. The Committee shall have the full
authority, in its sole discretion, to unilaterally modify, terminate or
cancel the plan at any time, in whole or in part, or with respect to any
designated participant, at any time, without liability to any participant.

NON-TRANSFERABILITY
A participant may not pledge, assign, sell, encumber, or transfer or
otherwise dispose of any rights or interests under the plan and any
attempted disposition shall be null and void.

                 SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AGREEMENT



                 AGREEMENT,  dated  as  of  ___________________,  1994 (this

"Agreement") between PHH CORPORATION (the "Employer") and ____________________ 

(the "Executive").

                            W I T N E S S E T H:

                 The  Executive  is among the senior management group of the

Employer, as currently established, and is a party to a Supplemental Executive

Retirement Agreement dated as of [all October 12, 1988 except Mr. Nagel

who  is  January  12, 1993] (the "Original Agreement").  In establishing the

Original Agreement, the Employer has concluded generally that it would be in

the  best interests of the Employer to provide for a relative parity in 

normal  retirement benefits amongst those executives included in the senior 

executive  management group, to redetermine the type and level of service that

qualifies  as  executive service and, in light of the Executive's particular

circumstances,  to  provide  certain  adjustments to various features of the

Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan, as amended and restated effective

May  1,  1987 as further amended by a First Amendment dated June 18, 1990, a

Second Amendment dated November 11, 1991, and a Third Amendment dated 

February  28, 1994 (the "Supplemental Plan") for the Executive. The Employer 

has reviewed the Original Agreement, reaffirmed its purposes and interest and

determined to update certain provisions in light of current circumstances, 

and the Executive has accepted and agreed upon the updating changes.

<PAGE>

                 Accordingly,  and in part pursuant to Section 2.1(g) of the
Supplemental Plan, the Employer and the Executive agree as follows:

         1.      Certain Definitions.

                 (a)      For  purposes  of  Section  6  of the Supplemental

         Plan,  "Credited Years of Executive Service" for the Executive shall 

         mean  the sum of _____ plus the number of years of employment by the 

         Employer or a Subsidiary from and after April 30, 1989.

                 (b)      For  purposes  of  Section 3.2 of the Supplemental

         Plan,  the Executive shall be considered as having sufficient Credited

         Years  of  Executive Service under this Agreement in order to

         qualify  for  a  _____%  Executive Service Benefit [or such greater

         percentage,  not  to  exceed 60%, as may be applicable by computing

         Credited  Years  of Executive Service as the sum of        plus the

         number  of years of employment by the Employer or a Subsidiary from

         and  after April 30, 1989].  [NOTE:  Material in brackets to be 

         included only if percentage is less than 60.]

                 (c)      For  purposes of Section 2.1(i) of the Supplemental

         Plan,  the  term "Final Average Compensation" shall not be less the


         amount  computed  thereunder  for the Employer's Fiscal Year ending

         April 30, 1993 for any determination made before April 30, 1998.

         2.      Payment  Offsets.  For purposes of Section 3.3 of the Plan,

in  addition to the reductions provided by clause (iv), qualified pension or

profit  sharing plans of subsequent employers whether or not affiliated with

the  Employer,  regardless  of  whether  the Executive actually receives any

amount in any given year, shall be included as an additional reduction, 

calculated  in  the  same manner as provided in Section 3.3 of the Supplemental

Plan.

         3.      Certain  Elections. In the event that the Executive terminates

employment  after  the sum of his age and Credited Years of Executive Service 

is at least 60, then, in lieu of the payment commencement date determined under

Section 6 of the Supplemental Plan, he shall be entitled to make an election to

receive at any age after 55 the Supplemental Retirement Benefit

duced  for  early receipt of benefits as provided in Section 3.3 of the Sup-

plemental Plan.

         4.      Employer.    For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "Employer"

includes any direct or indirect subsidiary controlled by the Employer within

the  meaning of Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and (b)

the  Employer  may transfer its obligations hereunder to any such subsidiary

that is the parent company of a major business unit of Employer's consolidated  

group, in which case PHH Corporation shall be relieved of its obligations 

hereunder.

         5.      Effect  of  This  Agreement.    This  Agreement supercedes,

amends  and  restates  the  Original  Agreement  and  is  intended to be and

constitutes  a  separate Agreement between the Employer and the Executive in

addition  to  any  and  all  rights  he  may now or hereafter have under the

Supplemental Plan, the Qualified Pension Plan as defined in the Supplemental

Plan, the PHH Long Term Disability Plan as defined in the Supplemental Plan,

the  PHH  Excess  Benefit  Plan  as defined in the Supplemental Plan and any

other rights and benefits to which the Executive is entitled.  All the terms

and provisions of the Supplemental Plan are hereby incorporated by reference

into,  and  made  a  part  of  this  Agreement without, however, changing or

diminishing  the  independent  application  of  the  provisions  of  the

Supplemental Plan to the Executive.

         IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement under

seal the date first above written.

                                    PURPOSE

provide  deferred  compensation  for  certain  highly  compensated
employees  of  PHH  Corporation  (formerly PHH Group, Inc.) and of
certain  of  its  affiliates.   Subject to the compensation limits
specified  in  Sections  3.1 and 4.1, the Plan compensates certain
designated participants in the PHH Corporation Pension Plan to the
extent  that benefits under such plan are reduced by virtue of the
limitations  on  benefits payable from tax qualified pension plans
set  forth in section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended
(the "Code") and the limit on compensation which may be taken into
account  under  tax  qualified  pension  plans  imposed by section
401(a)(17) of the Code.  The Plan is intended to qualify as a plan
maintained  for  the  benefit  of a "select group of management or
highly  compensated  employees"  within  the meaning of applicable
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
This  Plan  amends and restates the PHH Corporation Excess Benefit
Plan effective May 1, 1994.

                                   ARTICLE II

Employer  who  is  a  participant  in  the  Basic  Plan and who is

discretion, as an Eligible Employee.



           2.6   EMPLOYER means the Company and any other employer
which  participates  in the Basic Plan and which, with the consent

                                  ARTICLE III

                               LIFETIME BENEFITS

           3.1   ELIGIBILITY OF BENEFITS DURING LIFE.  An Eligible
Employee who retires under the Early Retirement, Normal Retirement
or  Deferred  Retirement  provision  of  the  Basic  Plan shall be
entitled  to  receive  compensation  under  this  Plan,  from  the
Company,  equal  to  the difference between the benefit payable to
the  Eligible  Employee under the Basic Plan and the benefit which
would  have  been payable to the Eligible Employee under the Basic
Plan  if  the  dollar and percentage limits on benefits imposed by
section  415(b)(1)  of the Code did not apply, and if the limit on
compensation  imposed  by  section  401(a)(17)  of  the  Code were
increased  to  one  hundred  sixty six and two-thirds percent (166
2/3%)  of  the actual 401(a)(17) limit.  If benefits payable to an
Eligible  Employee  under  the  Basic Plan are increased after the
Eligible  Employee's  participation  in the Basic Plan terminates,
whether  due  to  cost  of  living  increases  in the said section
415(b)(1)  or  401(a)(17)  limits  or otherwise, then the Eligible
Employee's  benefits  under  this  Plan  shall  be  decreased
accordingly.

           3.2   COMMENCEMENT  AND  FORM  OF BENEFITS DURING LIFE.
An  Eligible  Employee's benefits under Section 3.1 shall commence
at  the  same  time  as  the Eligible Employee's benefits commence
under  the  Basic Plan, and shall be paid to the Eligible Employee
in  the  same  form  as the Eligible Employee's benefits under the
Basic Plan.

                                DEATH BENEFITS

If   an  Eligible  Employee  dies  before  beginning  to  receive
compensation under this Plan, and if the surviving spouse or other
beneficiary  of  such  Eligible  Employee  is  entitled to a death
benefit  under  the Basic Plan, then the surviving spouse or other
beneficiary  of the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to receive
an  amount  under  this  Plan,  from  the  Company,  equal  to the
difference between the benefit payable to such surviving spouse or
other  beneficiary under the Basic Plan and the benefit which such
surviving  spouse  or  other beneficiary would have received under
the  Basic  Plan  if  the dollar and percentage limits on benefits
imposed  by section 415(b)(1) of the Code did

                              2
<PAGE>


not apply and if the
limit  on  compensation  imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code
were  increased  to  one  hundred sixty six and two-thirds percent
(166  2/3%)  of  the actual 401(a)(17) limit.  If benefits payable
under the Basic Plan to an Eligible Employee's surviving spouse or
other  beneficiary  are  increased  after  the Eligible Employee's
death, whether due to cost of living increases in the said section
415(b)(1)  or  401(a)(17)  limits  or otherwise, then the benefits
payable  to  the  surviving spouse or other beneficiary under this
Plan shall be decreased accordingly.

           4.2   DURATION  OF  PAYMENT.  The surviving spouse's or
the beneficiary's benefit payable under Section 4.1 shall commence
at  the  same  time as the surviving spouse's or the beneficiary's
death  benefit  under  the Basic Plan and shall continue until the
surviving  spouse's  or  the beneficiary's death benefit under the
Basic Plan terminates.

                                   ARTICLE V

                                 ADMINISTRATION

           5.4   CLAIMS PROCEDURE.

                 (a)   Initial  Claim.  If an Eligible Employee or
an  Eligible  Employee's  surviving  spouse  or  other beneficiary
(hereinafter  referred  to  as a "Claimant") is denied any benefit
under this Plan, the Claimant may file a claim with the Committee.
The  Committee  shall  review  the  claim  itself  or  appoint  an
individual  or  an entity to review the claim.  The Claimant shall
be  notified  within  sixty  (60)  days  after  the claim is filed
whether  the  claim  is  allowed  or  denied,  unless the Claimant
receives  written  notice  prior  to the end of the sixty (60) day
period stating that circumstances require an extension of the time
for  decision.    The  notice of the decision shall be in writing,
sent  by  mail  to  the Claimant's last known address, and, if the
notice  is  a  denial  of  the  claim, the notice must contain the
following information:

                       (1)   the specific reasons for the denial;

                       (2)   a  specific  reference  to  pertinent
provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based; and

                       (3)   if  applicable,  a description of any
additional information or material necessary to perfect the claim,
an  explanation  of why such information or material is necessary,
and an explanation of the Plan's claims review procedure.

                 (b)   Review  Procedure.   A Claimant is entitled
to  request  a  review  by  the  Committee  of  any  denial of the
Claimant's claim.  The request for review must be submitted to the
Committee  in  writing within sixty (60) days of mailing of notice
of  the denial.  Absent a request for review within the sixty (60)
day  period,  the  claim will be deemed to be conclusively denied.
The  review  of  a  denial  of  a  claim shall be conducted by the
Committee  or  an individual or entity appointed by the Committee.
The  reviewer  shall  afford the Claimant an opportunity to review
all  pertinent documents and submit issues and comments in writing
and  shall  render  a review decision in writing, all within sixty
(60)  days after receipt of a request for a review, provided that,
where  not prohibited by law, the reviewer may extend the time for
decision  by  not more than sixty (60) days upon written notice to
the  Claimant.    The Claimant shall receive written notice of the
reviewer's  decision,  together  with  specific  reasons  for  the
decision and reference to the pertinent provisions of the Plan.

           5.5   INDEMNIFICATION  AND  INSURANCE.    To the extent
permitted  by  law,  neither  the  Committee,  nor  any  other
person

                                 4

<PAGE>


performing  duties  hereunder, shall incur any liability for
any  act  done,  determination  made or failure to act, if in good
faith,  and the Company shall indemnify the Committee, its members
and  such  other  persons  against  any and all liability which is
incurred  as  a  result  of  the  good  faith  performance  or
non-performance  of  their duties hereunder.  Nothing in this Plan
shall  preclude the Company from purchasing liability insurance to
protect such persons with respect to their duties under this Plan.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

           6.1   LIMITATION  OF RIGHTS.  Nothing contained in this
Plan shall be construed to:

                 (a)   limit  in  any way the right of an Employer
to terminate an Eligible Employee's employment at any time; or

                 (b)   b e    evidence   of   any   agreement   or
understanding, express or implied, that an Employer will employ an
Eligible  Employee  in  a particular position or at any particular
rate of remuneration.



           6.2   LIFE  INSURANCE.  The Company, in its discretion,
may  apply  for  and  procure,  as  owner and for its own benefit,
insurance on the life of an Eligible Employee, in such amounts and
in  such  forms  as  the Company may choose.  An Eligible Employee
shall  have no interest whatsoever in any such policy or policies,
but,  at  the  request of the Company, the Eligible Employee shall
submit  to  medical  examinations  and supply such information and
execute such documents as may be required by the insurance company
or companies to whom the Company has applied for insurance.

           6.3   NONALIENATION  OF BENEFITS.  No benefit under the
Plan  shall  be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation,
sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any
attempt  to  do so shall be void.  No benefit under the Plan shall
in  any  manner  be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts,
liabilities,  engagements  or  torts of any person.  If any person
entitled  to  benefits under the Plan becomes bankrupt or attempts
to  anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber
or charge any benefit under the Plan, or if any attempt is made to
subject  any  such  benefit  to the debts, contracts, liabilities,
engagements  or  torts of the person entitled to any such benefit,
except  as  specifically  provided  in the Plan, then such benefit
shall  cease and

                              5

<PAGE>


terminate in the discretion of the Administrator,
and  the  Administrator  may  hold  or  apply the same or any part
thereof  to  the  benefit  of any dependent or beneficiary or such
person,  in  such  manner  and proportion as the Administrator may
deem  proper.   The Employer shall not in any manner be liable for
or  subject  to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of any person entitled to benefits hereunder.

           6.4   AMENDMENT  OR TERMINATION OF PLAN.  The Board may
amend  the  Plan  from time to time in any respect, and may at any
time  terminate  the  Plan in its entirety or as it applies to any
E m p l oyer;  provided,  however,  that  an  Eligible  Employee's
entitlement  to  benefits earned under this Plan as of the date of
amendment  or  termination may not be terminated or reduced.  This
Plan  shall  terminate automatically if the Basic Plan terminates,
i n    which  event  (i)  no  additional  employees  shall  become
participants  in this Plan and (ii) benefits under this Plan shall
be  paid in the same manner and at the same time as benefits under
the Basic Plan, regardless of whether Basic Plan benefits are paid
at or before an Eligible Employee's retirement.

           6.5   UNFUNDED  PLAN.    This  Plan  is  unfunded.  The
obligations  of  the  Company with respect to the benefits payable
hereunder  shall  be  paid out of the Company's general assets and
shall  not  be  secured by any form of trust, escrow or otherwise.
The  rights  of  an  Eligible Employee, or the Eligible Employee's
surviving  spouse or other beneficiary, to benefits under the Plan
shall  be  solely  those  of an unsecured creditor of the Company.
Any  insurance  policy  or other assets acquired by or held by the
Company  in connection with the liabilities assumed by it pursuant
to the Plan shall not be deemed to be held under any trust for the
benefit  of  an  Eligible  Employee  or  the  Eligible  Employee's
surviving  spouse  or  beneficiary,  or  to  be  security  for the
performance  of  the obligations of the Company, but shall be, and
remain,  a  general,  unpledged  and  unrestricted  asset  of  the
Company.  No representation shall be made to any Eligible Employee
which  is  contrary  to  this Section or which in any way suggests
that   any  insurance  policies  or  other  assets  which  may  be
maintained by the Company in respect of its obligations under this
Plan  will  be  used solely for that purpose.  Notwithstanding the
preceding  provisions  of  this  Section  6.5, the Company, in its
discretion,   may  establish  a  "rabbi"  trust  for  purposes  of
accumulating  or  holding  assets in connection with the Company's
liabilities  under  the  Plan  as  long  as  the establishment and
maintenance  of such trust does not cause benefits under this Plan
to  be  taxed  to  Eligible  Employees  before  such  benefits are
received.

                               6

<PAGE>


           6.6   CONSTRUCTION  OF  PLAN.    This  Plan shall be so
construed  that it will be maintained an unfunded plan of deferred
compensation  for  a  "select  group  of  management  or  highly
compensated employees" within the meaning of applicable provisions
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.



           6.7   COMPANY   OBLIGATIONS.    The  Company  shall  be
obligated  to  pay  benefits under this Plan to Eligible Employees
and  no other person shall be obligated to fulfill the obligations
of the Company under this Plan.

           6.8   FORFEITURE OF RIGHT TO FUTURE BENEFITS.  Notwith-
standing  any  other  provision of this Plan, an Eligible Employee
(or such  Eligible  Employee's  surviving  spouse  or  other
beneficiary) will forfeit all rights with respect to Plan benefits
on  account  of  which  payments  remain  to  be  made and will be
immediately  obligated  to return to the Company the amount of any
Plan  benefits previously distributed to the Eligible Employee and
the  Eligible  Employee's surviving spouse or other beneficiary if
(a)  such Eligible Employee, within a period of two years from the
date  his  or  her  employment with the Employer or its affiliates
terminates,  directly  or  indirectly,  either  individually or as
owner,  partner,  agent, employee, consultant or otherwise, except
for  the  account of and on behalf of the Employer or an affiliate
of  the  Employer,  engages  in  any activity competitive with the
business  of  the  Employer or an affiliate of the Employer, or in
competition  with  the Employer or one of its affiliates, solicits
or  otherwise  attempts to establish for himself or herself or for
any  other person, firm or entity, any business relationships with
any  person,  firm  or  corporation  which  was,  at  the time the
Eligible Employee's employment terminates or within one year prior
thereto,  a  customer  of the Employer or one of its affiliates or
(b)  an  Eligible  Employee's  employment is terminated because of
willful  misconduct  or gross negligence in the performance of his
or  her  duties,  as determined by the Employer, and the Committee
determines  in its sole and absolute discretion that such matching
contributions shall be forfeited.

                 If  an  Eligible  Employee  is  determined by the
Board,  in  its sole and absolute discretion, to have committed or
threatened  to  commit  an  act  set  forth  above,  the  Eligible
Employee,  by  the  Eligible  Employee's  participation  herein,
acknowledges  that  such  act will cause irreparable injury to the
Employer and that money damages alone will not provide an adequate
remedy  to  the  Employer, and that the Board may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, determine that the Employer is

                                7

<PAGE>

entitled to an injunction  against  such  act  and  direct  
the  appropriate representatives of the Employer to seek such an injunction.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                 EFFECTIVE DATE

           7.1   EFFECTIVE  DATE.   This amendment and restatement
of  the  Plan  shall  become  effective  May 1, 1994.  The Plan as
herein  amended  and restated shall apply to persons in the employ
of  an  Employer  on  and after that date.  The rights, if any, of
former  employees  of  any  Employer  whose  employment terminated
before  that date shall be determined under the terms of this Plan
as in effect immediately before May 1, 1994.

           IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Plan to
be  executed  and  its  seal to be affixed hereto, effective as of
May 1, 1994.

                          PHH CORPORATION 
                       AMENDED AND RESTATED 
              DEFERRED COMPENSATION TRUST AGREEMENT 
 
 
  THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED TRUST AGREEMENT is made and 
entered into this      day of           19  , by and between PHH 
Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Company"), and,  ("Trustee"). 

                         W I T N E S S E T H: 


  WHEREAS, the Company maintains two non-tax-qualified 
supplemental retirement plans known as the PHH Corporation 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the PHH Corporation 
Excess Benefit Plan (each such plan is referred to individually 
as a "Plan" and they are referred to collectively as the 
"Plans") to provide retirement benefits for certain of its key 
executives; and 


  WHEREAS, the Plans provide for the Company to pay all 
benefits from its general revenues and assets; and 

  WHEREAS, by Trust Agreement dated July 31, 1990 by and 
between the Company and the Security Trust Company, N.A. (the 
"Prior Trust Agreement"), the Company has heretofore established 
a trust fund with respect to the PHH Corporation Supplemental 
Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"); and 

  WHEREAS,                       is corporate successor 
to Security Trust, N.A. and as such serves as Trustee under the 
Prior Trust Agreement pursuant to Section 16.4 thereof; and 


<PAGE>


  WHEREAS, the Company wishes to amend and restate the 
Prior Trust Agreement as hereinafter set forth so that the trust 
fund will extend to both Plans; and 

  WHEREAS, the trust fund shall be subject to the claims 
of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's 
bankruptcy or insolvency, and may not necessarily hold 
sufficient assets to satisfy all of the benefits to be provided 
under the Plans; and 

  WHEREAS, contributions (if any) to the trust fund shall 
be held by the Trustee and invested, reinvested and distributed 
in accordance with the provisions of this Trust Agreement; and 

  WHEREAS, the trust established by this Trust Agreement 
is intended to be a "grantor trust" with the result that the 
corpus and income of the trust are treated as assets and income 
of the Company pursuant to sections 671 through 679 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual 
covenants contained herein, the Company and the Trustee, 
intending to be legally bound, declare and agree as follows. 
 
                         ARTICLE I 
                          GENERAL 

  1.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST.  The Company hereby 
establishes with the Trustee a grantor trust ("Trust") on behalf 
of the participants in the Plans (the "Participants") 


                           -2-

<PAGE>


and the beneficiaries of such Participants (the "Beneficiaries").  The 
Trust so established shall be governed by the terms of this 
Trust Agreement. The Company shall not be obligated to fund the 
Trust except as expressly provided herein. 


  1.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS.  The Trust shall consist of 
such sums of money and other property acceptable to the Trustee 
as from time to time shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee.  
The Trust shall be revocable unless and until a Change in 
Control or Potential Change in Control as described in Section 
1.4 occurs, at which time the Trust shall become irrevocable, 
subject, however, to the obligation of the Trustee to return 
assets to the Company upon a resolution of the Company's Board 
of Directors as described in Section 1.4.  Until such time, if 
ever, as the Trust becomes irrevocable, the Company shall have 
the right, upon written notice to the Trustee, to revoke the 
Trust and to receive a distribution of the Trust assets.  In the 
event the Trust becomes irrevocable, the Company shall have no 
right to direct the Trustee to return or divert any Trust assets 
before the payment of all Plan benefits to Participants and 
Beneficiaries except in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 7.5 below. 

  All money and other property of the Trust, all 
investments and reinvestments made therewith or proceeds thereof 
and all earnings and profits thereon, less all payments and 
charges as authorized herein, are hereinafter referred to 


                             -3-

<PAGE>


as the "Trust Fund."  The Trust Fund shall be held by the Trustee and 
shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this 
Trust Agreement.  The Trust Fund shall at all times be subject 
to the claims of the general creditors of the Company as set 
forth in Section 4.2.  The insufficiency of assets in the Trust 
shall not relieve the Company of its obligation or liability to 
make benefit payments otherwise due under the terms of the 
Plans. 


  1.3 CONTRIBUTIONS TO TRUST.  Except as required in 
Section 1.4 below, the Company in its discretion may contribute 
to the Trust from time to time such amounts as it deems 
advisable. 

  1.4 CHANGE IN CONTROL/POTENTIAL CHANGE IN CONTROL.    
Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or a Potential Change 
in Control as hereinafter defined, the Company shall pay to the 
Trustee sufficient amounts to fund all Accrued Benefits, as 
hereafter defined, under the Plans as of the date such Change in 
Control or Potential Change in Control occurs.  Accrued Benefits 
shall be valued by an independent actuarial firm (the 
"Actuaries") selected by the Company using the assumptions set 
forth in Schedule A to this Trust Agreement.  The Company shall 
furnish a copy of the Actuaries' valuation report to the Trustee 
within thirty (30) days after such date, and the Trustee shall 
be entitled to rely on such report.  If a Change in Control does 
not occur within ninety (90) days after 


                           -4-

<PAGE>


the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control, and the Board 
of Directors of the Company adopts a resolution to the effect 
that, for purposes of this Trust Agreement, a Change in 
Control is not imminent, any amounts contributed to the Trust 
because of the Potential Change in Control, together with any 
earnings thereon, shall be paid by the Trustee to the Company.  
For purposes of this Agreement (a) "Accrued Benefits" shall 
mean benefits calculated under the Plans based on (i) service 
as of the date of the Change in Control or Potential Change in 
Control and (ii) compensation projected to the benefit commencement 
date assumed on Schedule A to the Trust Agreement, using for that 
projection the Compensation Scale set forth on Schedule A, and 
(b) a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have taken place if: 
(i) a third person, including a "group" as defined in section 
13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, becomes the beneficial 
owner of shares of the Company having twenty percent (20%) or 
more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the 
election of directors of the Company; or (ii) as a result of, or 
in connection with, any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or 
other business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or 
any combination of the foregoing transactions (a "Transaction"), 
the persons who were directors of the Company before the Transaction 
shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of 
the Company or any successor to the Company.  A 


                             -5-

<PAGE>


"Potential Change in Control" shall be deemed to 
have taken place if (i) any third person commences a tender or 
exchange offer (other than a tender or exchange offer which, if 
consummated, would not result in a change of control) for twenty 
percent (20%) or more of the then outstanding shares of common 
stock or combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
voting securities; (ii) the Company enters into an agreement, 
the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a 
Change in Control; (iii) any person (including the Company) 
publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking 
actions which if consummated would constitute a Change in 
Control; or (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company adopts a 
resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Trust 
Agreement, a Change in Control is imminent.  The Company shall 
have a duty to inform the Trustee whenever a Change in Control 
or Potential Change in Control has occurred.  If any two 
Participants or Beneficiaries notify the Trustee in writing that 
a Change in Control has occurred then, unless, in the written 
opinion of counsel to the Company (which opinion may be based on 
representations of fact as long as counsel does not know that 
such representations are untrue) such a Change in Control has 
not occurred, a Change in Control will be deemed to have 
occurred for purposes of this Trust Agreement.

                          ARTICLE II 
                      TRUSTEE ACCEPTANCE 

  2.1 TRUSTEE ACCEPTANCE.  The Trustee accepts the 
Trust established under this Trust Agreement on the terms and 
subject to the provisions set forth herein, and it agrees to 
discharge and perform fully and faithfully all of the duties and 
obligations imposed upon it under this Trust Agreement. 

                           ARTICLE III 
                            THE PLANS 

  3.1 DELIVERY OF PLANS.  A copy of each Plan has been 
delivered to the Trustee.  All terms defined in the Plans shall 
have the same meanings when used herein unless expressly 
provided to the contrary herein.  The Company will deliver 
promptly to the Trustee copies of all amendments to the Plans. 

  3.2 PLANS TO CONTROL.  The terms of each Plan shall 
govern the amount, form and timing of benefit payments under 
that Plan to which a Participant or Beneficiary is entitled. 

  3.3 AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLANS.  The Company 
retains sole discretion to modify or amend any of the provisions 
of the Plans or to terminate one or both of them as provided 
therein.

                         ARTICLE IV 
                         TRUST FUND 


  4.1 GRANTOR TRUST; UNFUNDED PLANS.  It is intended 
that the Trust constitute a grantor trust under Code sections 
671 through 679, with the assets of the Trust Fund being treated 
as assets of the Company for purposes of Federal, state and 
local income tax laws.  The creation of this Trust is not 
intended to cause the Plans to be treated as a funded plan for 
purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974, as amended from time to time. 

  4.2. COMPANY INSOLVENCY. 

       (a) The assets of the Trust Fund shall at all 
times be subject to the rights of the bankruptcy or insolvency 
creditors of the Company under this Section.  At any time the 
Trustee has actual knowledge or has determined that the Company 
is Insolvent (as defined below), the Trustee shall deliver any 
undistributed principal and income in the Trust Fund to satisfy 
such claims of the general creditors of the Company as a court 
of competent jurisdiction may direct.  The Board of Directors 
and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall have the 
duty to inform the Trustee of the Company's Insolvency.  If the 
Company or a person claiming to be a creditor of the Company 
alleges in writing to the Trustee that the Company has become 
Insolvent, the Trustee shall independently determine, within 
thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, whether the 



                            -8-

<PAGE>


Company is Insolvent and, pending such determination, the 
Trustee shall discontinue payments under the Plans, shall hold 
the Trust Fund assets for the benefit of the Company's general 
creditors, and shall resume payments under the Plans only after 
the Trustee has determined that the Company is not Insolvent (or 
is no longer Insolvent, if the Trustee initially determined the 
Company to be Insolvent).  For purposes of such determination, 
the Trustee may employ legal counsel, accountants and other 
advisors and shall be entitled to rely on their advice.  Unless 
the Trustee has actual knowledge of the Company's Insolvency, 
the Trustee shall have no duty to inquire whether the Company is 
Insolvent.  The Trustee may in all events rely on such evidence 
concerning the Company's solvency as may be furnished to the 
Trustee which will give the Trustee a reasonable basis for 
making a determination concerning the Company's solvency.  For 
purposes of this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall be 
considered to possess any knowledge and information concerning 
the Company in the possession of the Trustee's Banking 
Department or other departments that can reasonably be imputed 
to the Trustee under normal bank procedures.  Nothing in this 
Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish any rights of the 
Participants and Beneficiaries to pursue their rights as general 
creditors of the Company with respect to payments under the 
Plans.  The Company shall be considered "Insolvent" for purposes 
of this Trust Agreement in 


                                  -9-

<PAGE>


the event of (a) the Company's inability to pay its debts as 
they mature, within the meaning of Section 15-202 of the 
Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act; (b) a general 
assignment for the benefit of the Company's creditors; (c) 
the voluntary commencement by the Company of any proceeding 
under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other 
law of any jurisdiction for the relief, liquidation or 
rehabilitation of debtors (all of which proceedings are 
hereinafter collectively referred to as "Insolvency 
Proceedings"); (d) the making of an admission by the Company of 
any of the material allegations of or consenting to or 
acquiescing in a petition, application, motion or complaint 
commencing an Insolvency Proceeding or the seeking by the 
Company of the appointment of, or the taking of possession by, a 
receiver, custodian, trustee, liquidator or similar official of 
or for a substantial part of its assets; (e) the involuntary 
commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding against the Company 
which is not fully stayed, timely controverted or dismissed 
within one hundred twenty (120) days after the filing thereof; 
or (f) the appointment of or taking of possession by a receiver, 
custodian, trustee, liquidator or similar official of or for the 
Company or of or for a substantial part of its assets. 


       (b) If the Trustee discontinues payments from 
the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 4.2(a) and subsequently 
resumes such payments, the first payment following such 


                      -10-

<PAGE>


discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all 
payments which would have been made (together with interest on 
the amount delayed at a rate equal to the "prime rate" charged 
by the Trustee's commercial lending department) in accordance 
with each Plan during the period of such discontinuance, less 
the aggregate amount of payments made under that Plan by the 
Company in lieu of the payments provided for hereunder during 
any such period of discontinuance. 

       (c) It is intended that the rights of the 
general creditors of the Company to enforce the provisions of 
this Article in the event of the Company's Insolvency be 
enforceable with respect to the Trust Fund at the time of 
Insolvency under both Federal and state law. 

                        ARTICLE V 
            DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE TRUSTEE 
               WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS 

  5.1 IN GENERAL. 

       (a) The Trustee shall invest and reinvest the 
principal and income of the Trust Fund as directed by the 
Company or, in the absence of direction, as it shall determine 
in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Trustee 
shall follow the Company's direction as to investments only if 
the Trustee, in its own judgment, determines that the Company's 
directions are reasonable in light of the current and 
anticipated obligations of the Plans.  The Trustee shall keep 


                              -11-

<PAGE>


the Trust Fund invested, without distinction between principal 
and income, in any property, whether real, personal or mixed, 
and wherever situated and whether or not productive of income, 
including without limitation, capital, common and preferred 
stocks and personal, corporate and governmental or other 
obligations, whether secured or unsecured, and including any 
collective part interest therein; mortgages, leaseholds, fees 
and other interests in realty; oil, gas or mineral properties 
and rights, royalties, payments or other interests in such 
properties; contracts, choses in action, trust and participation 
certificates or other evidences of ownership, part ownership or 
part interest; all without being limited or restricted to 
investments of a character authorized for trustees or other 
fiduciaries under any present or future laws and, except as 
otherwise required by Federal law, without regard to the 
proportion any such property may bear to the entire amount of 
the Trust Fund. 


       (b) Specifically, but not by way of limitation, 
the Trustee is authorized and empowered to invest all or any 
part of the Trust Fund in any common or collective trust fund or 
pooled investment fund presently or hereafter maintained by the 
Trustee as the same may be amended from time to time; and the 
declaration of trust establishing such common or collective fund 
is hereby made a part hereof as if set forth at length herein, 
the assets of the fund invested in said common or 

                                 -12-

<PAGE>

collective trusts shall be held and administered by the Trustee 
strictly in accordance with the terms of the instrument, and the 
combining of assets of the Trust Fund with assets of other trusts 
in such common or collective trust fund is specifically authorized 
hereby. 


       (c) The Trustee in its discretion may keep such 
portion of the Trust Fund in cash or cash balances or hold all 
or any portion of the Trust Fund in savings accounts, 
certificates of deposit and other types of time or demand 
deposits with any financial institution or quasi-financial 
institution, either domestic or foreign (including any such 
institution operated or maintained by the Trustee in its 
corporate capacity) as the Trustee may from time to time 
determine to be in the best interests of the Trust Fund. 


       (d) Notwithstanding any powers granted to 
Trustee pursuant to this Trust Agreement or to applicable law, 
Trustee shall not have any power that could give this Trust the 
objective of carrying on a business and dividing the gains 
therefrom, within the meaning of section 301.7701-2 of the 
Procedure and Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant to 
the Internal Revenue Code. 

       (e) In no event may Trustee invest in 
securities (including stock or rights to acquire stock) or 
obligations issued by the Company, other than a de minimis amount 
held in common investment vehicles in which Trustee invests.  All 


                           -13-

<PAGE>


rights associated with assets of the Trust shall 
be exercised by Trustee or the person designated by Trustee, and 
shall in no event be exercisable by or rest with Plan 
Participants. 
 
                       ARTICLE VI

                  PAYMENTS BY THE TRUSTEE 

  7.1 EFFECT OF ARTICLE.  This Article shall only apply 
after funds have been transferred to the Trust.  Until that 
time, this Article shall have no force or effect and shall 
impose no duties or obligations on the parties. 

  7.2 DELIVERY OF ACTUARIAL STATEMENTS.  The Company 
shall deliver to the Trustee a copy of each statement which the 
Company receives from the Company's actuaries concerning the 
Accrued Benefits of Participants (and, if applicable, 
Beneficiary) under the Plans upon receipt of such statement by 
the Company. 

  7.3 PAYMENTS FROM TRUST FUND.  Unless the Company has 
provided written evidence to the Trustee that the Company has 
made payments to Participants (and, if applicable, 
Beneficiaries) pursuant to the terms of the Plans, the Trustee 
shall make such payments from the Trust Fund provided that the 
Company is not Insolvent at the time of such payments.  If a 
Participant or Beneficiary does not receive a payment that he or 
she believes he or she has become entitled to under a Plan, he 
or she shall notify the Trustee of such entitlement.  The 
Trustee shall within ten (10) days after its receipt of such 
notice forward a copy of such notice to the Company.  If the 
Company fails to notify the Trustee within ten (10) days after 
its receipt of such notice that it denies the claim of the 


                          -17-

<PAGE>


Participant or Beneficiary to payment by the Trustee, the 
Trustee shall make payment from the Trust Fund to the 
Participant or Beneficiary under the terms of the Plan as soon 
as practicable and, in any event, within thirty (30) days after 
the expiration of said ten (10) day notice period.  The Trustee 
shall provide the Company with written confirmation of the fact 
and amount of such payment after it is made.  If the Company 
shall notify the Trustee within said ten (10) day notice period 
that it denies the claim of the Participant or Beneficiary to 
payment by the Trustee, then, within thirty (30) days after 
receipt by the Trustee of such notice from the Company, the 
Company shall commence an action or proceeding in court and 
shall join the Trustee so that the dispute may be resolved. Such 
action or proceeding shall be commenced in the Federal or state 
court at the situs of the Trust Fund, subject to removal by any 
party in accordance with the rules of practice applicable 
thereto. 

  7.4 TAX WITHHOLDING.  The Trustee shall deduct from 
each payment hereunder any Federal, state or local withholding 
or other taxes or charges which the Trustee is required to 
deduct under applicable laws. 

  7.5 RETURN OF EXCESS ASSETS.  As of each April 30 
(the "Determination Date") during the term of this Agreement, 
the Trustee shall determine the fair market value of such assets 
as may have been contributed to the Trust, and report 

                          -18-

<PAGE>

that value in writing to the Company.  If the total assets of the 
Trust exceed 110% of the present value of the Accrued Benefits under 
the Plans as of that date (valued by the Actuaries in the same 
way that benefits were valued for purposes of Section 1.4 
above), the Trustee shall pay to the Company the amount of any 
such excess or agree to a reduction in the face amount of any 
letter of credit used to fund the Trust equal to the amount of 
such excess.  The determination of the above items and the 
amount, if any, to be paid to the Company, shall be made not 
later than the September 1 next following each Determination 
Date, and payment to the Company if any, shall be made within 
thirty (30) days after the determination is completed.  The 
payment of excess assets to the Company under this Section 7.5 
shall only be made to the extent that assets are available to 
make such payment, and the  Trustee shall not be required to 
surrender or borrow from any insurance policy to fund such 
payment nor shall the Trustee be required to sell any stock or 
liquidate any other asset should the Trustee in its sole 
discretion deem it not prudent to do so. 


  7.6 LETTER OF CREDIT.  The Company may provide to the 
Trustee as an asset of the Trust Fund one or more irrevocable 
and unconditional letters of credit.  The Trustee shall accept a 
letter of credit as part of the Trust Fund only if (i) it is 
irrevocable and grants the Trustee the unconditional right to 
draw upon it in whole or in part at any time, (ii) it is issued  


                           -19-

<PAGE>


by a bank having total assets at the time the letter of credit 
is issued of at least $1 billion, and (iii) the Trustee has 
received an opinion of Piper & Marbury, or of other outside 
legal counsel selected by the Company, addressed to the Trustee, 
to the effect that the acceptance by the Trustee of a letter of 
credit as part of the Trust Fund should not adversely affect the 
status of the trust as a "grantor trust" for purposes of the 
Code.  The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such opinion.  
The Trustee agrees that it shall draw upon a letter of credit 
only upon the following circumstances: (i) the letter of credit 
will expire within fifteen (15) days and either the letter of 
credit has not been renewed or the Trustee has not received from 
the Company assets having a market value equal to the face 
amount of the letter of credit, or (ii) the Trustee is obligated 
to make payments to a Participant or Beneficiary or to commence 
an action or proceeding in court in the nature of interpleader 
as provided in Section 7.3 and the Trustee, in its sole and 
absolute discretion, determines that it does not have sufficient 
liquid assets to make the payments which it is obligated to make 
or which are under dispute pursuant to Section 7.3. 


  7.7 ACCELERATED PAYMENTS.  Notwithstanding any 
provision of the Trust Agreement or the Plans to the contrary, 
the Trustee shall make payments of Plan benefits hereunder 
before such payments are otherwise due if it determines, based 



                         -20-

<PAGE>

on an opinion of counsel to the Trustee (who may, but need not, 
be counsel to the Company), that a Participant or Beneficiary 
has recognized or will recognize income for federal income tax 
purposes with respect to amounts that are or will be payable to 
him or her under a Plan before they otherwise would be paid to 
him or her.  The amount to be paid under this Section 7.7 shall 
be the amount of the benefit which the Participant or 
Beneficiary recognizes as income.  Payments under this Section 
7.7 shall be made during the year in which the Participant or 
Beneficiary recognizes income, or as soon as practicable 
thereafter.  Payments under this Section 7.7 shall reduce 
benefits otherwise payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under 
the terms of the Plan with respect to which payments are made.

*Amounts reflect a one-third portion of rentals, the portion deemed
representative of the interest factor.
Note: The interest included in fixed charges consists of the amounts identified
      as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the
      substantial portion of which represents interest on debt incurred to
      finance leasing and mortgage banking activities, as well as the interest
      costs associated with home relocation services which are ordinarily
      recovered through direct billings to clients and are included with
      "Costs, including interest, of carrying and reselling homes" in the
      Consolidated Financial Statements.
