PART I

ITEM l.  BUSINESS

(a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Company (the term "Company" as used herein includes the 
registrant identified on the facing sheet, The Clorox Company,
and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise) 
was originally founded in Oakland, California in 1913 as the 
Electro-Alkaline Company.  It was reincorporated as Clorox 
Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox Chemical Co. in 
1928, and as The Clorox Company (an Ohio corporation) in 
1957, when the business was acquired by The Procter & 
Gamble Company.  The Company was fully divested by The 
Procter & Gamble Company in 1969 and, as an independent 
company, was reincorporated in 1973 in California as 
The Clorox Company.  In 1986, the Company was 
reincorporated in Delaware.

The Clorox Company Annual Report for the Year Ended 
June 30, 1994 ("Annual Report") to its stockholders is 
included in this Form l0-K.  Portions of the Annual Report 
are incorporated herein by specific reference.

During fiscal year 1994, the Company continued the 
implementation of a new strategy for its domestic 
business.  The process of divestiture of the Company's 
frozen food product lines and its bottled water 
business was completed.  In its continuing operations, 
the Company continued to focus on expanding the business 
through internal development of new products and line 
extensions of existing products.  The Company introduced 
14 new products in the U.S. during fiscal year 1994.  
It also continued its strategy of considering 
strategic acquisitions and, in that regard,  acquired 
S.O.S brand soap pads during the fiscal year.  In 
addition to the S.O.S domestic business, the S.O.S 
acquisition provided a major source of growth in the 
Company's Canadian operations.  

Internationally, the Company continued the implementation 
of its strategy of expanding its laundry, household 
cleaning and insecticide businesses to markets where 
these categories are not yet fully developed, but 
where high potential exists.  With Yuhan Corporation, 
the Company formed the joint venture Yuhan-Clorox Co., 
Inc., which is now the leading bleach producer in the Republic 
of Korea.  During fiscal year 1994, the Company made two 
acquisitions of bleach businesses in Chile and reached a 
definitive agreement to acquire the leading scrubber pad 
and stain remover business in Argentina, the acquisition of
which was completed in July 1994.  The Company is in the 
process of completing a merger of its Argentine subsidiaries, 
following the increase of the Company's ownership of its 
Argentine operations which occurred at the end of fiscal 
year 1993.

(b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

The Company's operations are predominantly in one segment 
- -- non-durable household consumer products.  Such 
operations include the production and marketing of 
non-durable consumer products sold primarily through 
grocery and other retail stores.  Financial information 
for the last three fiscal years attributable to the 
Company's operations is set forth in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, pages 20 through 29 of the 
Annual Report, incorporated herein by this reference.




(c)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.  Products currently marketed in the 
United States and certain foreign countries are listed 
on page 36 of the Annual Report, incorporated herein 
by this reference.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS - METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION.  Most 
non-durable household consumer products are 
nationally advertised and sold within the United 
States to grocery stores through a network of 
brokers that was reduced through consolidation during 
fiscal year 1994, and to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, 
military and other retail stores primarily through 
a direct sales force.  The Company also sells, 
within the United States, institutional versions of specialty 
food and non-food products.  Outside the United States, the 
Company sells consumer products through subsidiaries, 
licensees, distributors and joint venture arrangements 
with local partners.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.  The Company 
has obtained ample supplies of all required raw materials 
and packaging supplies, which, with a few exceptions, 
were available from a wide variety of sources during 
fiscal year 1994.  Contingency plans have been developed 
for single sourced supplier materials.  No supply problems 
are presently anticipated.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.  Although some products are 
covered by patents, the Company does not believe that 
patents, patent licenses or similar arrangements are 
material to its business.  Most of the Company's brand 
name consumer products are protected by registered 
trademarks.  Its brand names and trademarks are extremely 
important to its business and the Company pursues a 
course of vigorous action against apparent infringements.

SEASONALITY.  The only portions of the operations of the 
Company which have any significant degree of seasonality 
are the marketing of charcoal briquets and insecticides.  
Most sales of these product lines occur in the third and 
fourth fiscal quarters.  Working capital to carry 
inventories built up in the off-season and to extend 
terms to customers is generally provided by internally 
generated funds plus commercial paper lines of credit.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG.  During fiscal year 1994, 
revenue from the Company's sales of its products to 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliated companies 
exceeded 10% of the Company's gross consolidated 
revenues.  Except for this relationship, the Company is 
not dependent upon any other single customer or a 
few customers.  Order backlog is not a significant 
factor in the Company's business.

RENEGOTIATION.  None of the Company's operations is 
subject to renegotiation or termination at the election 
of the Federal government.

COMPETITION.  The markets for consumer products are highly 
competitive and most of the Company's products compete 
with other nationally advertised brands within each 
category, and with "private label" brands and "generic" 
non-branded products of grocery chains and wholesale 
cooperatives.  Competition is encountered from similar 
and alternative products, many of which are produced 
and marketed by major national concerns having financial 
resources greater than those of the Company.

A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or 
newly developed) usually encounters intense competition 
requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and 
sales promotion.  If a product gains consumer acceptance, 
it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional 
support to maintain relative market position.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  The Company's operations 
incurred expenses of approximately $44,558,000 in fiscal 
year 1994, $42,445,000 in fiscal year 1993 and 
$42,052,000 in fiscal year 1992 on research activities 
relating to the development of new products or the maintenance 
and improvement of existing products.  None of such research 
activity was customer sponsored.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  The Company does not anticipate 
making material capital expenditures in the future for 
environmental control facilities or to comply with 
environmental laws and regulations.  However, in general, 
the Company does anticipate spending increasing amounts 
annually for facility upgrades and for environmental 
programs.  The amount of capital expenditures for 
environmental compliance was not material in fiscal 
year 1994 and is not expected to be material in the 
next fiscal year.

In addition, the Company is involved in certain 
other environmental matters, as follows:

(i)  The Company sold its architectural coatings business 
in fiscal year 1990.  In connection with the disposition 
of those manufacturing facilities, the Company retained 
responsibility for certain environmental obligations.  
The financial reserve established at the time of the 
sale is expected to be adequate to cover the financial 
responsibilities for environmental matters which may 
arise in the future.

(ii)  The Company has been named as a potentially 
responsible party ("PRP") by the Environmental Protection 
Agency pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control 
Act, the Sanitary Landfill Closure and Contingency Fund 
Act, and a section of the Solid Waste Management Act, 
for two sites in New Jersey.  Based on the Company's 
experience and because the Company's level of 
involvement is extremely limited, the Company does not 
expect that these matters will represent a material 
cost to the Company in the future.

(iii)  The Company received a "No Further Action" 
letter regarding New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery 
Act requirements related to the sale of its Jersey 
City, New Jersey manufacturing facility, which occurred 
during fiscal year 1994.  The Company does not expect 
that the cost of any future environmental liability 
in connection with the sale of this facility will 
be material.

(iv)  The Company operates a water treatment 
operation at its former Oakland, California 
manufacturing location.  This operation will be 
an on-going cost for the foreseeable future.  A 
financial reserve established in an earlier year 
is considered by management to be adequate to 
cover the future costs of this water treatment 
operation.

(v)  During fiscal year 1994, the Company executed an 
"Administrative Order on Consent" indicating its 
willingness to participate in a "de minimis" 
settlement offer relating to its alleged involvement at 
the American Chemical Services site in Griffith, Indiana.  
The Company does not expect the settlement to represent 
a material cost in the future.

(vi)  The Company has been identified as a PRP by the 
Environmental Protection Agency for a site in Johnson 
County, Kansas.  The Company is currently negotiating a 
settlement of this matter, which is not expected to 
represent a material cost to the Company.

(vii)  The Company has incurred environmental remediation 
costs at one of its facilities in Chicago, Illinois, 
which are not material.  The Company is seeking 
reimbursement of all these costs from an adjacent 
property owner.

(viii)  The Company has announced that it contemplates 
the sale of its Dyersburg, Tennessee manufacturing facility 
and its Frederick, Maryland manufacturing facility.  
Customary environmental investigations are being conducted 
in conjunction with the contemplated sales of these sites.  
The Company does not expect that material environmental 
liabilities will be identified, and accordingly has not
recorded any loss contingencies.

(ix)  The Company has been named in a private action 
by a party seeking contribution by the Company for 
remediation costs relating to a site that the Company 
may have formerly been  associated with in Dickinson 
County, Michigan.  Although the parties are currently 
in the discovery process and the basis for the Company's 
potential liability has not yet been clearly 
identified,  the Company does not expect that this 
matter will represent a material cost in the future.

Although the potential cost to the Company related to 
the above ongoing environmental matters is uncertain 
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible 
pollution and clean-up costs; the complexity and evolving 
nature of governmental laws and regulations and their 
interpretations; and the timing, varying costs and 
effectiveness of alternative clean-up technologies; based 
on its experience and without offsetting for expected 
insurance recoveries or discounting for present value, 
the Company does not expect that such costs individually 
and in the aggregate will represent a material cost to 
the Company or affect its competitive position.

NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.  At the end of fiscal year 1994, 
approximately 4,850 persons were employed by the Company's 
continuing operations.

(d)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC 
OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES.

Net sales, pretax earnings and identifiable assets 
related to foreign operations and export sales are 
each below l0% of the respective consolidated amounts 
for the Company for fiscal year 1994, have been below 
these levels for the two preceding fiscal years, but 
may not be indicative of future levels due to the 
Company's strategy to expand its international operations.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

PRODUCTION FACILITIES.  The Company operates production 
and major warehouse facilities for its operations in 
approximately 30 locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, 
Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and the Republic of Korea.  
The vast majority of the space is owned.  Some space, 
mainly for warehousing, is leased.  The facility in Jersey 
City, New Jersey was sold during fiscal year 1994.  The 
Frederick, Maryland facility was closed in August 1994.  
As part of the acquisition of  S.O.S in fiscal year 1994, 
the Company acquired two facilities, one in the United States 
and the other in Canada.  The Canadian S.O.S facility is 
scheduled to be closed in fiscal year 1995.  The Company 
considers its manufacturing and warehousing facilities to 
be adequate to support its business.

OFFICES AND TECHNICAL CENTER.  The Company's general office 
building is owned and is located in Oakland, California.  The 
Company also occupies leased office space in Oakland one 
block from its general office building.  The Company's 
Technical Center and Data Center are owned and are located 
in Pleasanton, California.  Leased sales and other office 
facilities are located at a number of manufacturing and 
other locations.

ENCUMBRANCES.  None of the Company's owned facilities 
are encumbered to secure debt owed by the Company, except 
that the manufacturing facility in Wheeling, Illinois 
secures industrial revenue bond indebtedness incurred in 
relation to the construction thereof.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

None.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF 
SECURITY HOLDERS

None.

THE CLOROX COMPANY STOCK OPTION PLAN (1977)
(Amended 10/16/80, 7/21/82, 6/21/83,  10/19/83,
9/18/85, 11/20/85, 7/15/87 and 11/19/93)




ARTICLE A -- PURPOSE

The purpose of The Clorox Company Stock Option Plan (1977) is
to encourage those key employees of The Clorox Company 
(the "Company") and affiliated companies who are largely 
responsible for the success and development of the business 
to increase their proprietary interest in the Company by 
the allotment and sale to them by the Company of shares of 
Clorox Common Stock as provided in this Plan.

ARTICLE B -- SALE OF SHARES

The allotment and sale of shares of Clorox Common Stock 
shall be made through the granting of options to purchase 
said shares in accordance with and subject to the terms 
and restrictions of this Plan.  Such options may or may 
not qualify as "Incentive Stock Options" under Section 
422A of the Internal Revenue Code (as it may hereafter 
from time to time be amended). (Amended 7/21/82).

ARTICLE C -- NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE SOLD THROUGH OPTIONS

The aggregate number of shares of Clorox Common Stock 
which may be issued under all options to be granted 
pursuant to this Plan shall not exceed one million 
nine hundred thousand (1,900,000) shares.  The shares 
to be delivered upon exercise of options granted under 
this Plan shall be made available at the discretion of 
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") 
out of either authorized and unissued shares or 
treasury shares. (Amended 10/19/83).

ARTICLE D -- ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN

  1.  This plan shall be administered by the committee of
      the Board (the "Committee") designated by it for that
      purpose.  The Committee shall be composed of three or 
      more members of the Board who are not officers or 
      employees of the Company or an affiliated company, to 
      be appointed by the Board from time to time and to 
      serve at the pleasure of the Board.

  2.  It shall be the duty of the Committee to administer 
      this Plan in accordance with its provisions, to report
      thereon not less than once each year to the Board, and
      to make such recommendations of amendments or otherwise
      as it may deem necessary.  A decision by a majority of
      the Committee shall govern all actions of the Committee.
      Members of the Committee shall not be eligible to receive
      options under this Plan while serving, but may exercise
      options previously granted in accordance with the terms
      of said options.

  3.  Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the 
      Committee shall have authority to grant options, to 
      construe the respective option agreements and this Plan,
      to determine the terms and provisions of the respective
      option agreements including the setting of the dates 
      when the option or parts of it may be exercised, and 
      to make all other determinations necessary or advisable
      for administering this Plan.  If an option is intended
      to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, the option 
      agreement shall contain those terms and conditions 
      necessary to so qualify said option. (Amended 7/21/82).

  4.  The Committee may establish from time to time such 
      regulations, provisions, and procedures, within the 
      terms of this Plan as, in its opinion, may be advisable 
      in the administration of this Plan.

  5.  The Committee may designate the Secretary of the 
      Company or other employees of the Company to assist 
      the Committee in the administration of this Plan and 
      may grant authority to such persons to execute 
      documents on behalf of the Committee.

  6.  The Committee shall have the authority to grant options
      consistent with the terms and conditions of this Plan, 
      but which may contain other provisions satisfying the 
      conditions of any applicable law or regulation 
      affording the option or the optionee favorable 
      treatment for specified purposes.

ARTICLE E -- PARTICIPATION

The Committee shall select those key employees of the Company
and affiliated companies who, in the opinion of the Committee,
have demonstrated a capacity for contributing in a 
substantial measure to the success of the Company, and 
shall determine the number of shares with respect to which 
options are to be granted to each.

ARTICLE F -- OPTION PRICE

The option price shall be established by the Committee as of 
the date the option is granted and shall be not less than 
100% of the fair market value of such shares on the day 
such option is granted.

ARTICLE G -- CONDITION OF OPTIONS

The fact that an employee has been granted an option under 
this Plan shall not affect or qualify the right of the 
employer to terminate his employment at any time.

ARTICLE H -- NUMBER OF OPTIONS

More than one option may be granted to any employee 
under this Plan.

ARTICLE I -- ADJUSTMENT

Appropriate adjustments in the number of shares which can be 
issued (ARTICLE C), and in the numbers and option prices of 
shares covered by outstanding options granted hereunder, 
shall be made to give effect to any stock splits, stock 
dividends, or other changes in the stock of the Company.

ARTICLE J -- EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

  1.  Any stock option granted by the committee shall have a 
      maximum life of ten (10) years from the date of grant.

  2.  No option granted under this Plan shall be exercisable 
      within one (1) year from the date of grant.

  3.  In case an optionee ceases to be an employee of the 
      Company or any of its affiliated companies while 
      holding an unexercised option:

      (a)  Any unexercisable portions of the option are then 
           void except in case of death of the optionee.

      (b)  Except in case of death or retirement of the 
           optionee, any exercisable portions of an option 
           shall terminate and be no longer exercisable 
           unless exercised before the expiration date 
           of the option or within three (3) months of 
           the date of such cessation, whichever is earlier.
          (Amended 10/16/80).

  4.  When an employee retires, in accordance with the 
      provisions of any appropriate profit sharing or 
      retirement plan of the Company or any of its 
      affiliated companies, any options shall become 
      immediately exercisable at any time prior to the 
      expiration date of the options or within a period 
      following the employee's retirement date specified 
      from time to time by the Committee, whichever 
      period is shorter.  Termination of employment 
      under the permanent disability settlement 
      provision of any such plan shall be deemed the 
      same as retirement. (Amended 11/17/93)

      If the Compensation Committee changes the time 
      period following Retirement in which an Option 
      may be exercised, the change will not (i) have the 
      effect of shortening the exercise period of Options 
      held by persons who retired before the effective 
      date of the Compensation Committee's action, to (ii) 
      make exercisable any Option which had expired pursuant 
      to an exercise time period previously set by the 
      Compensation Committee. (Added 11/17/93)

  5.  Options are not transferable otherwise than by will 
      or by the laws of descent and distribution.

  6.  In case of the death of the optionee while an employee 
      of the Company or any of its affiliated companies, 
      the persons to whom the options have been transferred 
      by will or by the laws of descent and distribution 
      shall have the privilege of exercising remaining 
      options or parts thereof (whether or not exercisable 
      on the date of the death of such employee) at any 
      time prior to the expiration date of the option or 
      within one (1) year of the date of death of the 
      optionee, whichever is earlier.  Otherwise, any option 
      may be exercised only by the optionee personally or 
      by his legal representative.

  7.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit an 
      option which is being exercised either (a) by an 
      optionee who has retired due to permanent disability or 
      (b) after the death of the optionee, as provided in 
      paragraphs 4 and 6 above, to be surrendered, in lieu 
      of exercise, for an amount equal to the difference 
      between the option price and the fair market value, 
      if higher, of shares of Clorox Common Stock on the 
      day the option is surrendered, payment to be made 
      in shares of Clorox Common Stock valued at their 
      fair market value on such date, cash or a combination 
      thereof, in such proportion and upon such other terms 
      and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee.
      The difference between the number of shares subject to 
      options so surrendered and the number of shares, 
      if any, issued upon exercise shall represent shares 
      which shall not be available for granting future options 
      under this Plan.

  8.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit an 
      option which is being exercised by an optionee who is 
      subject to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to be 
      surrendered in part in lieu of exercise and exercised 
      in part as follows: not less than 50% of the number 
      of shares being exercised must be paid for at the 
      option price; and the remaining number of shares 
      may be surrendered for an amount per share equal 
      to the difference between the option price and the 
      fair market value of shares of Clorox Common Stock 
      on the day the option is so surrendered, payable by 
      the Company in cash but in no event shall the amount 
      paid per share exceed 100% of the option price of the 
      shares so surrendered.  The number of shares so 
      surrendered, as well as the shares issued, shall 
      represent shares which shall not be available for 
      granting future options under this Plan.

  9.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, time spent on leave of 
      absence shall be considered as employment for the 
      purposes of this Plan.  Leave of absence means any 
      period of time away from work granted to an employee 
      by the employer because of illness or injury or 
      because of other reasons satisfactory to the employer.

 10.  A certificate or certificates for the shares purchased 
      through the exercise of options will be issued in 
      regular course after exercise of the option and 
      payment therefore The Company reserves the right 
      from time to time to suspend the exercise of any 
      option for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days 
      where such suspension is required for corporate 
      purposes.  No such suspension shall extend the 
      life of the option beyond its expiration date and, 
      in no event, will there be a suspension in the five 
      calendar days immediately preceding the expiration 
      date.

 11.  On exercise of an option, payment of the option price 
      may be made (a) in cash or (b) in shares of Clorox 
      Common Stock valued at their fair market value on 
      the date of such payment, or a combination thereof.  
      Certificate(s) for such shares tendered in payment 
      shall be in a form for good delivery and the optionee 
      must have held the tendered shares for at least one 
      year.  In addition, after July 1, 1983, (i) only an 
      optionee who is not at the time subject to the 
      provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended, may pay the option price in 
      shares receivable upon exercise of the option being 
      exercised, valued at their fair market value on the 
      date of such payment plus cash for any resulting 
      fraction of a share, and only with respect to options 
      outstanding on June 30, 1983; and (ii) no option 
      granted will be exercisable in the manner described in 
      (i) hereof. (Amended 6/21/83).

 12.	 The Company shall have the power to withhold, or require
      an optionee to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient
      to satisfy any federal, state, local or foreign
      withholding tax requirements on any non-qualified stock
      option exercised pursuant to the Plan.

      To the extent permissible under applicable tax, 
      securities, and other laws, the Company may, in its 
      sole discretion, permit the optionee to satisfy a tax 
      withholding requirement by directing the Company to 
      apply shares of stock to which the optionee is entitled 
      as a result of the exercise of an option other than an 
      Incentive Stock Option, to satisfy such requirement.  
      (Added 7/15/87).

ARTICLE K -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

  1.  The Board may at any time repeal this Plan and may 
      amend it from time to time.  The optionee and the 
      Company shall be bound by any such amendments as of 
      their effective dates, but if any outstanding options 
      are affected, notice thereof shall be given to the 
      holders of such options and such amendments shall not 
      be applicable to any option without the consent of the 
      optionee.  If this Plan is repealed in its entirety, 
      any unexercised option shall continue to be exercisable 
      in accordance with its terms.

  2.  Should any option expire, cease to be exercisable or 
      be otherwise canceled without being fully exercised, 
      the number of shares as to which the option has not 
      been exercised shall thereupon continue to be reserved 
      for, and be subject to, the granting of options under 
      this Plan.  Such shares may be optioned again to the 
      employee who had been granted such canceled option 
      or to other employees at an option price, determined 
      in accordance with Article F, which may be lower than, 
      the option price of such canceled option.

  3.  No shares shall be issued or delivered upon the 
      exercise of any option unless and until, in the opinion
      of Counsel for the Company, any applicable registration
      requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 
      any applicable listing requirements of any national 
      securities exchange on which stock of the same class 
      is then listed and any other requirements of law or of 
      any regulatory body having jurisdiction over such 
      issuance or delivery shall have been fully complied 
      with.

  4.  "Affiliated company" means any company controlling, 
      controlled by or under common control with the Company.

ARTICLE L -- CONSENT OF OPTIONEE

Every optionee shall be bound by the terms and restrictions 
of this Plan and his acceptance of an option shall constitute 
an agreement between him and the Company or an affiliated 
company and any successors in interest to any of them.

ARTICLE M -- PERFORMANCE UNITS (Add 10/16/80)

  1.  The Committee may from time to time, and subject to the 
      provisions of this Plan and such other terms and 
      conditions as the Board or the Committee may prescribe, 
      grant one or more performance units to any optionee 
      under the 1977 Plan with respect to options granted 
      thereunder at any time or to any optionee under the 
      1968 Plan with respect to outstanding options granted 
      thereunder and outstanding as of October 17, 1980.  
      Performance units shall be related (on a one-for-one 
      basis and with the effect herein set forth) to shares 
      which are subject to an option granted on or after 
      October 17, 1980 and to shares which are subject to 
      an option granted under either Plan outstanding as 
      of October 17, 1980 but only to the extent then 
      unexercised.

  2.  Upon the exercise of any option to which performance 
      units have been related by grant of the Committee, 
      there shall be canceled that number of performance 
      units equal to the sum of the shares issued on 
      exercise plus the number of shares surrendered in lieu 
      of exercise.

  3.  The value of a performance unit and the method of 
      assigning the value shall be determined by the Committee 
      at the time of the granting of the performance unit.  
      The value to be paid shall be based upon the achievement 
      of criteria of performance over an award period, such 
      criteria and period to be determined by the Committee 
      at the time of grant.  In its administration of this 
      Plan, the Committee shall have full discretion to 
      change from time to time the criteria of performance 
      with respect to outstanding performance units in 
      recognition of conditions, events or transactions not 
      foreseen at the time of grant.

  4.  At the expiration of the award period determined by 
      the Committee for each performance unit, the 
      performance unit value, if any, shall be credited 
      to an account for the benefit of the optionee who 
      shall thereafter have a fully vested interest in 
      that value, with payment deferred as hereafter 
      provided.   Interest shall be credited to that 
      account at a rate fixed from time to time by the 
      Committee.  Thereafter, if the option to purchase 
      the related shares is exercised or if the related 
      shares are surrendered in lieu of exercise, there 
      shall be charged to the optionee's account the 
      value of that number of performance units (plus 
      any interest accrued thereon) equal to the sum of 
      the shares issued on exercise plus the number of 
      shares surrendered in lieu of exercise.

  5.  Payment of the vested performance unit values 
      (plus any interest accrued thereon) shall be 
      deferred until the earliest of the following dates 
      and be made in the manner respectively set forth:

      (a)  At the expiration of the original term of the 
           option to purchase the related shares, in the 
           discretion of the Committee, the value may be 
           paid up to approximately one-half in full shares of 
           Clorox Common Stock valued at their fair market 
           value on the date of such payment and the balance 
           in cash, or all in cash.

      (b)  In case an optionee ceases to be an employee of 
           the Company or any of its affiliated companies, 
           except in case of death or retirement of the 
           optionee, in five equal annual cash payments 
           commencing on the date of such cessation unless 
           the Committee, in its sole discretion, fixes a 
           shorter term;

      (c)  On retirement of the optionee, in cash at any 
           time elected by the optionee within one (1) year 
           of the date of retirement;

      (d)  On death of the optionee, in cash at anytime 
           elected by the optionee's legal representative 
           within one (1) year of the date of death.

      If vested performance unit values are paid as above, 
      the number of shares subject to related stock options 
      shall represent shares which shall not be available for 
      granting future options under this Plan.

ARTICLE N -- DURATION OF PLAN

This Plan will terminate on October 31, 1987 unless an earlier 
termination date is fixed by action of the Board, but any 
options granted prior thereto may be exercised in accordance 
with their terms.

Article 7.  The Stock Option Plan

     7.1 Grant of Options.  One plan under the Program
shall relate to Options.  Subject to the other applicable
provisions of the Program, Options may be granted to
Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be
determined by the Committee.  The Committee shall have
complete discretion in determining the number of Options
granted to each Participant.  The Committee may grant any
type of Option permitted by law at the time of grant and
shall specify whether or not any Option is intended to be
an incentive stock option described in section 422A of the
Code.  In the case of incentive stock options, the following
conditions shall apply in addition to any other requirements
of this plan or the Code:
     (a)  10-Percent Stockholders.  An optionee must not,
immediately before an incentive stock option is granted,
own stock representing more than ten percent of the voting
power or value of all classes of Stock of the Company or of
any subsidiary.  This requirement is waived if (i) the
exercise price of the incentive stock option to be granted
is at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the
Stock subject to the Option, determined at the time the
Option is granted, and (ii) the Option is not exercisable
more than five years from the date the Option is granted.
     (b)  Annual Limitation.  The aggregate Fair Market
Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of
the Stock with respect to  which incentive stock options
are exercisable for the first time by the optionee during
any calendar year may not exceed $100,000.

     7.2 Option Agreement.  Each Option shall be evidenced
by an Option agreement that shall specify the type of Option
granted, the Option price, the duration of the Option, the
number of shares to which the Option pertains, and such other
provisions as the Committee shall determine.

     7.3 Option Price.  No Option granted pursuant to this
plan shall have an Option price that is less than the Fair
Market Value of the Stock on the date the Option is granted.

     7.4 Duration of Options.  Each Option shall expire at
such time as the Committee shall determine at the time it
is granted, provided; however, that no Option shall be
exercisable later than ten years and one day from the date
of its grant.

7/15/87

<PAGE>

     7.5 Exercise of Options.  Options granted under this
plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to
such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in
each instance approve, which need not be the same for all
Participants.  Each Option which is intended to qualify
as an incentive stock option pursuant to Section 422A of
the Code shall comply with the applicable provisions of
the Code pertaining to such Options.

     7.6 Payment.  The Option price of Stock upon exercise
of any Option shall be paid in full either (i) in cash, or
(ii) in shares of Stock valued at their Fair Market Value
on the date of exercise, or (iii) by a combination of (i)
and (ii), in the manner provided in the Option agreement.
Certificates for such shares tendered in payment shall be
in a form of good delivery and, if the certificates were
issued pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock
option, the optionee must have held the tendered shares
for at least one year.

     7.7 Restrictions on Stock Transferability.  The
Committee may impose such restrictions on any shares
acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option under this
plan as it may deem advisable, including, without
limitation, restrictions under applicable Federal
securities law, under the requirements of any stock
exchange upon which such shares of Stock are then
listed and under any state securities laws applicable
to such shares.

7/15/87

<PAGE>

     7.8  Termination of Employment Due to Death,
Disability, or Retirement.  In the event the employment
of a Participant is terminated by reason of death or
Disability, any outstanding Options then exercisable may
be exercised at the time prior to the expiration date of
the Options or within 12 months after such date of
termination of employment, whichever period is the
shorter.  In the event of termination of employment by
reason of Retirement, all of the Participant's options
which have been outstanding for more than six months shall
become immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any
time prior to the expiration date of the Options or within
a period following the Participant's Retirement specified
from time to time by the Committee, whichever period is
shorter.  Options which have been outstanding for less than
six months on the date of the Participant's Retirement shall
not become exercisable until they have been outstanding for
six months and thereafter may be exercised at any time prior
to the expiration of the Option or within the period
following the Participant's Retirement specified from time
to time by the Committee, whichever period is shorter.
However, in the case of incentive stock options, the
favorable tax treatment prescribed under section 422A of
the Code shall not be available if such options are not
exercised within three months after date of termination,
or 12 months in the case of death or disability as defined
in section 22(e) (3) of the Code. If an incentive stock
option is not exercised within three months of termination
due to Retirement, it shall be treated as a nonstatutory
stock option for the remainder of its allowable exercise
period.

If the Compensation Committee changes the time period
following Retirement in which an Option may be exercised,
the change will not (i) have the effect of shortening the
exercise period of Options held by persons who retired
before the effective date of the Compensation Committee's
action, or (ii) make exercisable any Option which had
expired pursuant to an exercise time period previously
set by the Compensation Committee.

     7.9 Termination of Employment Other Than for Death,
Disability, Retirement or Termination for Cause.  If the
employment of the Participant shall terminate for any reason
other than death, Disability, Retirement, or Termination for
Cause, the rights under any then outstanding Option granted
pursuant to this plan shall terminate upon the expiration
date of the Option or three months after such date of
termination of employment, whichever first occurs.  Upon
a Termination for Cause rights under all Options shall
terminate immediately.

     7.10 Nontransferability.  No Option granted under the
plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or
otherwise alienated or hypothecated, otherwise than by will
or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Further, all
Options granted to a Participant under this plan shall be
exercisable during his lifetime only by such Participant.


10/16/91 - Section 7.8 effective Retroactively to 7/1/91.
11/17/93 - Section 7.8 regarding post retirement exercise
period changed.
11/17/93 - Last paragraph of Section 7.8 added. 

<PAGE>

    7.11 Time of Exercise for Incentive Stock Options.
Notwithstanding other provisions pertaining to the times
at which Options may be exercised, no Option that is
intended to be an incentive stock option shall first
become exercisable at a time earlier than that originally
specified in the Option grant, if the result would be to
cause such Option, when granted, not to be treated as an
incentive stock option (whether by reason of the possible
future violation of the annual limitation of section 7.1(b)
or otherwise).

Article 8.  The Restricted Stock Plan

     8.1 Grant of Restricted Stock.  One plan under the
Program shall relate to Restricted Stock.  Subject to
other applicable provisions of the Program, the Committee,
at any time and from time to time, may grant shares of
Restricted Stock under the plan to such Participants and
in such amounts as it shall determine.  The Committee may
also offer participants in the Company's management
incentive compensation plan, or any other Company bonus
or incentive plan in which awards are otherwise paid
primarily or totally in cash, the opportunity to elect
to receive Restricted Stock, including a bonus amount of
Restricted Stock to serve as an incentive to make such an
election, in lieu of receiving all or a portion of the
participant's award in cash.  Each grant of Restricted
Stock shall be in writing and shall specify the Period(s)
of Restriction and the time or times, which may be
accelerated upon the attainment of specific financial
goals, at which such period(s) shall lapse with respect
to a specified number of shares of Stock.  The Periods of
Restriction shall not exceed ten years from the date of
grant of the Restricted Stock.

     8.2 Nontransferability.  Except as provided in section
8.8 hereof, the shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder
may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise
alienated or hypothecated for such period of time as shall
be determined by the Committee and shall be specified in
the Restricted Stock grant, or upon earlier satisfaction
or other conditions as specified by the Committee in its
sole discretion and set forth in the Restricted Stock grant.

     8.3 Other Restrictions.  The Committee may impose such
other restrictions on any shares of Restricted Stock granted
pursuant to this plan as it may deem advisable including,
without limitation, restrictions under applicable Federal
or state securities laws, and may legend the certificates
representing Restricted Stock to give appropriate notice
of such restrictions.

     8.4 Voting Rights.  Participants holding shares of
Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting
rights with respect to those shares during the Period of
Restriction.

     8.5 Dividends and Other Distributions.  During the
Periods of Restriction, Participants holding shares of
Restricted Stock granted hereunder shall be entitled to
receive all dividends and other distributions paid with
respect to those shares while they are so held.  If any
such dividends or distributions are paid in shares of Stock,
those shares shall be subject to the same restrictions on
transferability as the shares of Restricted Stock with
respect to which they were paid.

11/17/93 - Former Article 8 (Stock Indemnification Rights)
Deleted.  Section 8.1 added accelerated vesting upon meeting
goals and right to receive Restricted Stock in lieu of cash
bonus.

     8.6 Termination of Employment Due to Retirement.
     (a)  In the event that a Participant terminates his
          employment due to Retirement, the Periods of
          Restriction applicable to the Restricted Stock
          pursuant to subsection 8.2 hereof, shall lapse
          automatically and, except as otherwise provided
          in subsection 8.3 and 8.6 (b), the Shares of
          Restricted Stock shall thereby be free of
          restrictions and freely transferable if such
          Restricted Stock was issued to the Participant
          more than six months prior to the Participant's
          Retirement Date.  With regard to Restricted Stock
          issued to the Participant less than six months
          before the Participant's Retirement Date, the
          Periods of Restriction shall lapse only after
          six months have elapsed since the issuance.
     (b)  If the grant of Restricted Stock contains a
          provision permitting lapse of the Period(s)
          of Restriction to be accelerated upon the
          attainment of specific financial goals, a
          Participant's Retirement will not accelerate
          the lapse of the Period(s) of  Restriction.
          In such a case the Participant's Restricted
          Stock shall not be forfeited but the Period(s)
          of Restriction will lapse at the earlier of the
          Participant's death or upon the achievement of
          the conditions specified in the grant of the
          Restricted Stock.

     8.7 Termination of Employment Due to Death or
Disability.  In the event a Participant's employment with
the Company terminates because of his death or Disability
during the Periods of Restriction, the restrictions
applicable to the shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to
section 8.2 hereof shall lapse automatically.

     8.8 Termination of Employment for Reasons Other Than
Death, Disability, or Retirement.  Except as otherwise
provided in this section, in the event that a Participant's
employment with the Company terminates for any reason other
than those set forth in sections 8.6 and 8.7 during the
Periods of Restriction, any shares of Restricted Stock
still subject to restrictions at the date of such
termination automatically shall be forfeited and returned
to the Company.  In the event of an involuntary termination
of the employment of a Participant by the Company other
than a Termination for Cause, the Committee in its sole
discretion may waive the automatic forfeiture of any or
all such shares.  With regard to Restricted Stock granted
pursuant to an election to receive Restricted Stock in
lieu of a cash award under the Company's Management
Incentive Compensation Plan, or any other Company bonus
or incentive plan in which awards are otherwise paid
primarily or totally in cash, the Committee may provide
at the time of the grant that upon the Participant's
termination of employment for any reason, or for any
reason other than Termination for Cause, the restrictions
applicable to those shares of Restricted Stock, including
any bonus amount, shall lapse automatically.

10/16/91 Section 8.6 Effective Retroactively to 7/1/91
11/17/93 Section 8.6 (b) added
11/17/93 Provision for vesting Restricted Stock received

Units may be granted to Participants at any time and from
time to time as shall be determined by the Committee.  The
Committee shall have complete discretion in determining the
number of Performance Units granted to each Participant.

     9.2 Value of Performance Units.  Each Performance Unit
shall have an arbitrary value to be determined by the
Committee at the time of grant.  The Committee shall
establish performance goals in its discretion which,
depending on the extent to which they are met, will
determine the ultimate value of the Performance Unit to
the Participant.  The time period during which the
performance goals must be met shall be called a performance
period, and also is to be determined by the Committee.

     9.3 Payment of Performance Units.  After a performance
period has ended, the holder of a Performance Unit shall be
entitled to receive the value thereof as determined pursuant
to section 9.2.

     9.4 Form and Timing of Payment.  Payment under section
9.3 above shall be made in cash and/or shares of Stock and
shall be in the form of a lump sum or installments as
prescribed by the Committee.  If any payment is to be made
on a deferred basis, the Committee may provide for the
payment of additional compensation computed in a manner
like interest during the deferral period.  In general, the
time and manner of making installment payments and the
interest component that is applied during the period of
deferral shall be determined by the Committee.

     9.5 Termination of Employment Due to Death, Disability,
or Retirement.  In the case of death, Disability or
Retirement, the holder of a Performance Unit shall receive
perorate payment based on the number of full months' of
service completed during the performance period but based
on the achievement of performance goals during the entire
performance period.  Payment shall be made at the time
payments are made to Participants who did not terminate
service during the performance period.

of an involuntary termination of employment of the
Participant by the Company other than a Termination for
Cause, the Committee in its sole discretion may waive
the automatic forfeiture provisions and pay out on a
perorate basis.

     9.7 Nontransferability.  No Performance Unit granted
under this plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned,
or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will
or by the laws of descent and distribution to the extent
permitted by section 9.5 until the termination of the
applicable performance period.

pursuant to Subsection (f) above;

             (ii)     The date three months after the
termination of the Optionee's Service for any reason
other than Retirement or Total and Permanent Disability.

     The Optionee may exercise all or part of his or her
Options at any time before the expiration of such Options

such Options had become exercisable before his or her
Service terminated or became exercisable as a result of
the termination.  The balance of such Options shall lapse

Service but before the expiration of his or her Options,
all or part of such Options may be exercised at any time
within 12 months after the date of death by the executors
or administrators of the Optionee's estate or by any person
who has acquired such Options directly from him or her by
bequest, inheritance or beneficiary designation under the
Plan, but only to the extent that such Options had become
exercisable before his or her Service terminated or became
exercisable as a result of the termination.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Clorox Company


Results of Operations
- ---------------------------

The Company's continuing operations again achieved record unit 
volume in 1994, following record years in 1993 and 1992. The 
increase in unit volume was principally due to the S.O.S 
acquisition, the consolidation of an Argentine subsidiary in 
which the Company increased its interest to 90 percent in June 
1993, and the introduction of new products including Liquid-Plumr
build-up remover, Clorox Stain-Out soil and stain remover, 
Clorox toilet bowl cleaners, Tilex soap scum remover, and Hidden
Valley Ranch kids' dressings. Also contributing to volume growth
were record shipments for Clorox liquid bleach, Pine-Sol cleaners,
and the Kingsford line of charcoal briquets.

Net sales increased 12 percent in 1994, following increases of 
6 percent in 1993, and 5 percent in 1992. This year's growth 
was primarily driven by volume increases from the acquisitions
and new product introductions described above. Price increases 
on a few established brands were offset by a price decrease on 
Pine-Sol cleaner and increased incentive trade promotions.

Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was 45 
percent in 1994, and 44 percent in both 1993 and 1992. 
Research and Development (R&D) expense increased 5 percent 
over 1993 and 1992, but remained relatively constant as a 
percent of net sales in 1994, while achieving a second 
consecutive record year of new product introductions. In 
1993, the R&D function began to implement several productivity 
improvements to bring products to market faster and at lower 
overall costs. These efficiencies were realized in 1994 and 
the Company aims to continue to shorten development times 
and further improve cost efficiency, while maintaining a 
high level of new product activity in 1995.

Selling, delivery and administration (SD&A) expenses were up 
10 percent over 1993 but decreased slightly as a percent of net 
sales. Without the S.O.S and Argentine acquisitions, SD&A was 
approximately one percentage point lower as a percent of net 
sales (19 percent), versus 1993 and 1992. This cost reduction 
is a reflection of several significant cost savings projects 
including broker and advertising agency consolidations, the 
initiation of a new logistics strategy, and improved budgetary 
controls, all of which occurred or were initiated in 1994. 
The Company will continue to focus on improving its cost 
structure during 1995.

Total marketing spending, comprising trade promotions, 
consumer promotions and advertising, increased versus 1993 
levels. Advertising expense alone increased 18 percent 
versus 1993 principally as a result of the Company's new 
product introductions and line extensions in late 1993 and 
during 1994. In spite of an overall increase in marketing 
spending in 1993, advertising expense in 1993 decreased 8 
percent from the 1992 level, reflecting a shift toward 
trade promotions during 1993.

Interest expense, the majority of which relates to long-term
debt, was level with 1993. Interest expense related to 
commercial paper borrowings to finance seasonal working 
capital needs also was in line with 1993. Interest expense 
is down significantly compared with 1992 principally due to 
strong cash flows, which reduced the need for commercial 
paper borrowings, and to lower interest rates.

The Company's effective tax rates were 41.3 percent, 
39.0 percent, and 40.9 percent in 1994, 1993, and 1992, 
respectively. The higher rate in 1994 was principally due 
to a 1 percent increase in the statutory federal tax rate, 
and the retroactive effect of that increase which was 
reflected in 1994 earnings. The statutory rate increase 
had the effect of reducing earnings per share from 
continuing operations by $.11. The lower rate in 1993 
versus 1992 primarily resulted from the favorable resolution
of tax liabilities in prior years.

Earnings per share from continuing operations in 1994 
increased $.28 from 1993, a 9 percent increase which 
was driven principally by the volume growth described 
above and shares purchased in 1994 under the Company's 
share repurchase program. Earnings per share in 1994 
increased $.89 from 1993, which was in turn up $1.23 from 
1992, the year which included a $.35 per share charge from 
adopting the accounting standard for postretirement 
health-care benefits. In early 1994, the Company sold its 
bottled water and frozen foods businesses. Earnings per 
share in 1994 include $.59 relating primarily to the gain 
on the sale of these discontinued operations.

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 112 in 1994, and included the cumulative 
expense, which was not material, in operations. This 
statement requires the accrual of benefits provided by 
the Company to former or inactive employees after 
employment, but before retirement.

Financial Position and Liquidity
- ------------------------------------

Cash flow from 1994 continuing operations was a record 
$298,440,000 and resulted from record earnings supported 
by a relatively modest increase in working capital. The 
modest increase in working capital relative to the growth 
of the business was largely due to management's focus on 
the efficient utilization of working capital items, driven
by the Clorox Value Measure (CVM) economic value 
measurement system that was implemented this year. The graph
on page 18 shows that CVM was on an upward trend during 
the last two years. Favorable working capital changes 
were moderated by the acceleration of income tax payments 
due to the 1993 tax law changes. In 1993, cash provided by 
operations was down from 1992 principally due to adverse 
changes in working capital, primarily accounts receivable 
and accounts payable.

Proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations generated 
cash of $159,293,000 in 1994. The strong cash flows from 
continuing operations and the sale of discontinued operations 
enabled the Company's cash position at June 30, 1994 to 
increase approximately $45,000,000 from a year ago to 
approximately $116,000,000. 

Dividends paid during 1994 amounted to $97,095,000, or 
$1.80 per share. In July 1994, the Company announced a 6.7 
percent increase in the quarterly dividend to $.48 per share 
from $.45 per share, for a new annual rate of $1.92.

At June 30, 1994, the Company had a $200,000,000 credit 
agreement with a syndication of banks which was renewed in 
August 1994, and now expires in August 1995. Management 
believes that the Company has access to additional bank 
credit and the public debt markets should the need arise. 
Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings and 
long-term debt at year-end increased slightly from 1993 
year-end. 

On January 31, 1994, the Company purchased the S.O.S products 
business for $116,488,000. The effect of this acquisition 
was not dilutive to earnings in 1994. Also, during 1994, 
the Company made additional foreign investments of 
$25,949,000. During 1993, the Company had acquired a controlling 
interest in its joint venture in Argentina that previously 
had been accounted for on the equity basis and as of June 30, 
1993 was consolidated.

Capital expenditures were $56,627,000, $77,637,000, and 
$124,742,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. 
Spending generally has been for expanded capacity, 
process improvements, and environmental programs and 
initiatives. Capital spending has declined significantly from 
1992 as that year included the majority of the Company's
spending on its most recently built domestic facility, a bleach
plant in Aberdeen, Maryland.

In each of 1994, 1993, and 1992, cash flow from operations 
has exceeded cash needs for capital expenditures, dividends, 
and scheduled debt service, and is expected to do so again in 
1995.

In 1989, the Company commenced a program to repurchase up to 
5 million shares of its outstanding stock through periodic 
open market and block transactions. These shares are and will 
be held in the Company's treasury and reissued for corporate 
uses. Through June 30, 1994, the Company had repurchased 
3,674,515 shares, of which 1,883,000 shares at a cost of 
$99,910,000 were acquired during 1994.

In order to manage the impact of interest rate movements on 
interest expense and interest income, the Company has approved 
the use of interest rate derivative instruments, such as 
interest rate swaps. These instruments have the effect of 
converting fixed rate interest to floating, or floating to 
fixed. The conditions under which derivatives can be used 
are set forth in a Company Policy Statement, and include a 
restriction on the amount of such activity to a designated 
portion of existing debt, a limit on the term of any 
derivative transaction, and a specific prohibition on the 
use of any leveraged derivatives.

Although not material, in 1994 the Company hedged its 
exposure to certain foreign currency denominated supply 
contracts and accounts receivable with foreign currency 
contracts.

The Company is committed to an ongoing program of comprehensive, 
long-term environmental assessment of its facilities. 
This program is implemented by the CompanyUs Department of 
Health, Safety and Environment, with guidance from the 
Company's legal counsel. During each facility assessment, 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
is evaluated and the facility is reviewed in an effort to 
identify possible future environmental liabilities. Although 
not material, at June 30, 1994 and 1993, the Company accrued 
for the probable future costs of environmental liabilities 
without offsetting for expected insurance recoveries or 
discounting for present value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Clorox Company

1
Significant Accounting Policies
- ----------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation

The Company is principally engaged in the production and 
marketing of nondurable consumer products to grocery stores 
and other retail outlets. The consolidated financial statements
include the statements of the Company and its majority-owned 
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and 
accounts are eliminated in consolidation.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments consist of money market and other high 
quality instruments with an initial maturity of three months 
or less and are stated at cost which approximates market value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost 
of the majority of inventories is determined on the last-in, 
first-out (LIFO) method. Cost for the remainder of the 
inventories is determined generally on the first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) method.

Brands, Trademarks, Patents 
and Other Intangibles

Brands, trademarks, patents and other intangible assets 
arising from transactions after October 31, 1970 are 
amortized over their estimated useful lives up to a 
maximum of 40 years. Carrying values are reviewed 
periodically and a determination of impairment is 
based on estimates of future cash flows, undiscounted 
and without interest charges.

Investments in Affiliates

The Company holds minority investments in foreign entities 
which are accounted for under the equity method. The most 
significant investment is a 20 percent equity ownership in 
Henkel Iberica, S.A. of Spain.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method to account for 
income taxes, in accordance with Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income 
Taxes". 

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using 
the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange 
rates during the year. Translation gains and losses are 
reported primarily in stockholders' equity and are excluded 
from net earnings. 

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share are computed by dividing net earnings 
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
during the year. The potential dilution from the exercise of 
stock options is not material.

Major Customer

Sales to the Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
and affiliates, were 12% of consolidated net sales in 1994.

Accounting Changes

In 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting 
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". In adopting
SFAS No. 106, the Company elected to fully recognize 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of July 1, 
1991 (see Note 13). The cumulative effect of adoption 
resulted in a charge to 1992 earnings of $19,061,000 
($.35 per share), net of $11,832,000 tax benefit. 


2
Discontinued Operations
- -------------------------

The Company sold its bottled water and frozen foods businesses
during the first quarter of 1994 for $159,293,000. The sale of 
these businesses resulted in a net gain of $31,430,000. In June 
1993, the Company sold its Prince Castle business which did 
not result in a material gain or loss.
Results of discontinued operations are classified separately 
in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings and include

consisted primarily of accounts payable and accrued 
liabilities. 


3
Acquisitions
- --------------

On January 31, 1994, the Company acquired and accounted for as 
a purchase, the S.O.S products business of Miles Inc. The 
acquisition cost of $116,488,000 included the S.O.S brand 
of steel wool soap pads and other cleaning products in the 
United States and Canada, manufacturing facilities, and 
certain items of working capital. Approximately $98,850,000 
of the purchase price has been allocated to brands and 
trademarks to be amortized over 40 years. The purchase 
included at fair value current assets of $9,200,000, 
property, plant and equipment of $15,600,000, and the 
assumption of current liabilities of $5,300,000 and a 
postretirement health-care liability of $1,900,000. The 
acquisition was funded from cash and short term borrowings.
Results of operations after the acquisition date are included 
in the 1994 Statement of Consolidated Earnings. The following 
pro forma information has been prepared assuming that this 
acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the respective 
periods. The pro forma information includes adjustments for 
interest expense that would have been incurred to finance the 
purchase, additional depreciation based on the fair market 
value of the property, plant, and equipment acquired, and the 
amortization of intangibles arising from the transaction. The 
pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative 
of the results of operations as they would have been had the 
transactions been effected on the assumed dates.

an additional 39 percent interest in its joint venture in 
Argentina bringing total ownership to 90 percent. This 
investment had been accounted for on the equity method and 
as of June 30, 1993 was consolidated.

Had the cost of inventories been determined using the FIFO 
method, inventories would have been higher by approximately 
$14,843,000 at June 30, 1994 and $14,735,000 at June 30, 1993. 
The LIFO method was used to value 85 percent of the inventory 
at June 30, 1994 and 88 percent at June 30, 1993.

Long-term debt                          $216,088       $204,000 

The Company has a $200,000,000 credit agreement with a syndication
of banks which was renewed in August 1994, and now expires in 
August 1995. The credit agreement requires maintenance of a 
minimum net worth of $600,000,000. At June 30, 1994, the credit 
agreement was available for general corporate purposes and for 
the support of additional commercial paper issuance.
At June 30, 1994, the Company had four outstanding interest rate 
swap agreements under which the Company receives average fixed 
rates of 6.3 percent on a combined notional amount of 
$100,000,000 and pays a floating rate based on LIBOR, an 
average of 3.9 percent in 1994, as determined in six-month 
intervals through October 16, 2001. At June 30, 1993, the 
Company had one outstanding interest rate swap and received 
6.8 percent fixed and paid 3.6 percent variable interest on 
notional principal of $50,000,000. Original terms to maturity 
ranged from 81/2 to 73/4 years. At June 30, 1994, the remaining 
term for all the agreements was approximately seven years. 
The transactions effectively convert a portion of the Company's
interest rate exposure on the 8.8 percent notes from a fixed 
rate to a floating rate. The effect of swap agreements as a 
hedge of the 8.8 percent fixed rate notes reduced interest 
expense by $1,803,000 and $1,179,000, and resulted in effective 
borrowing rates of 7.9 percent and 8.2 percent in years 1994 
and 1993, respectively. The fair value of these agreements at 
June 30, 1994 and 1993 was an unrealized (loss) gain of 
($8,422,000) and $3,500,000, respectively, based on the 
market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of 
the 8.8 percent notes at June 30, 1994 and 1993 was 
approximately $212,250,000 and $234,000,000, respectively, 
based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt.


9
Stockholders' Equity
- --------------------------

In addition to common stock, the Company is authorized to 
issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value 
of $1 per share, none of which is outstanding. The Company 
has a stock option plan under which options to purchase 
shares of common stock may be granted to key employees. 
The plan provides that the option price shall not be less 
than the fair market value of the shares on the date of 
grant and that no portion of the option may be exercised 
beyond 10 years from that date. At June 30, 1994, there were 
1,943,220 shares available for the granting of additional 
options or other stock compensation awards. A summary of 
changes in common stock options during 1994 and 1993 is:

The June 30, 1994 deferred income tax liability reflects a 
$28,466,000 decrease which is not included in the 1994 
deferred tax expense. This results from the reversal of a 
prior year tax accrual recorded in conjunction with the 
1991 purchase of Pine-Sol. The accrual was deemed unnecessary
as a result of the 1993 tax law change. The offset to this 
adjustment was a reduction in brands, trademarks, patents and 
other intangibles in 1994.

Employee Benefit Plans
- ---------------------------

Retirement Income Plans

The Company has defined benefit pension plans for substantially
all its domestic employees. Benefits are based on either 
employee years of service and compensation or stated dollar 
amount per year of service. The Company is the sole 
contributor to the plans, in amounts deemed necessary to 
provide benefits and to the extent deductible for federal 
income tax purposes. Assets of the plans consist primarily 
of stocks and bonds. The components of pension expense are 
(in thousands):

The Company has defined contribution plans for most of its 
domestic employees not covered by collective bargaining 
agreements, to which it contributes based on its earnings or 
participants' contributions. The Company also participates 
in multi-employer pension plans for certain of its hourly-paid 
production employees and contributes to those plans based on 
collective bargaining agreements. The aggregate cost of the 
defined contribution and multi-employer pension plans was 
$12,753,000 in 1994, $11,570,000 in 1993, and $7,970,000 in 1992.

Retirement Health-Care

The Company provides certain health-care benefits for employees 
who meet age, participation and length of service requirements 
at retirement. The plans pay stated percentages of covered 
expenses after annual deductibles have been met. Benefits paid 
take into consideration payments by Medicare. The plans are not 
prefunded, and the Company has the right to modify or terminate 
certain of these plans.

Postretirement health-care expense consists of the following 
(in thousands):

                                       1994      1993      1992

                                   =============================

Benefits paid were $1,058,000, $1,060,000 and $550,000 in 1994, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) 
includes the following at June 30 (in thousands):
                                            1994        1993

                                      -----------------------
Total unfunded accrued benefit
 obligation included in other
 obligations                           $  45,566   $  40,199 
                                      ========================

Included in 1994 amounts is $1,900,000 representing the 
assumption of postretirement health-care liabilities related 
to the acquisition of the S.O.S brands. The assumed health-care 
cost trend rate used in measuring the APBO was 12 percent for 
1995, gradually declining to 5.5 percent over the next 10 years. 
Changes in these rates can have a significant effect on 
amounts reported. A one percentage point increase in the 
trend rates would increase the 1994 accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation by $6,742,000 and increase 1994 expense by 
$805,000. The discount rate used to determine the APBO was 8 
percent.

Discontinued Operations

As a result of the Company's decision to discontinue operations 
of its bottled water and frozen foods businesses, curtailment 
gains of $2,104,000 for pension benefits and $1,228,000 for 
postretirement health-care were recognized in 1994 in income 
from discontinued operations.

Postemployment Benefits

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", in November 
1992. This Statement requires the accrual of benefits provided 
by the Company to former or inactive employees after employment, 
but before retirement. The Company adopted SFAS No. 112 in 
1994, and included the cumulative expense, which was not 
material, in operations.


14

Contingent Liabilities
- ---------------------------

The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims 
arising out of its businesses which include contracts, 
environmental issues, product liability, patent and trademark 
matters, and taxes. In the opinion of management, after 
consultation with counsel, the disposition of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in 
the aggregate, on the Company's financial position, results 
of operations, or liquidity.

Responsibility for Consolidated 
Financial Statements

The management of the Company is responsible for the integrity 
and objectivity of the financial statements included in this 
Annual Report. In fulfilling this responsibility, management 
maintains an effective system of internal accounting controls 
and supports a comprehensive internal audit program.
The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee consisting of 
independent directors. The Committee meets regularly with 
management, internal auditors and Deloitte & Touche, 
independent certified public accountants. Deloitte & 
Touche and the internal auditors have full authority to meet 
with the Audit Committee, either with or without management 
representatives present.
Deloitte & Touche has completed its audit of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements. Their report appears below. 



Independent Auditors' Report

[DELOITTE & TOUCHE LOGO]

The Stockholders and Board of Directors 
of The Clorox Company: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of The Clorox Company and its subsidiaries as of 
June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related statements of 
consolidated earnings, consolidated stockholders' equity and 
consolidated cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1994, 
1993, and 1992. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of The Clorox Company and its subsidiaries at 
June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for the years ended 
June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, in 1992 the Company changed its method of 
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 106.
