                                     PART I



ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

  THE COMPANY.  The J. M. Smucker Company was begun in 1897 and was
incorporated in Ohio in 1921.  The Company, generally referred to as
"SMUCKER'S" (a registered trademark), operates in one industry, the
manufacturing and marketing of food products on a worldwide basis.  Unless
otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Company" as used in this report
means The J. M. Smucker Company and its subsidiaries.

  PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.  The principal products of the Company are jams, jellies,
preserves, fruit spreads, frozen pies, dessert toppings, syrups, peanut butter,
industrial fruit products (such as bakery and yogurt fillings), fruit and
vegetable juices, juice beverages, pie fillings, condiments, and gift packages.

  The Company is structured around six strategic business areas:  Consumer,
Mrs. Smith's, Foodservice, International, Industrial, and Specialty Foods.
Within the domestic markets, the Company's products are primarily sold through
brokers to chain, wholesale, cooperative, and independent grocery accounts and
other consumer markets, and to foodservice distributors and chains including:
hotels, restaurants, and institutions.  Industrial products such as bakery and
fruit fillings are typically sold direct to other food manufacturers and
marketers for inclusion in their products.  The Company's acquisition of the
Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co., a subsidiary of Kellogg Company in late fiscal
1994 has allowed the Company to expand its distribution into the frozen foods
section of the grocery store.

  The Company's distribution outside the United States is principally in
Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Latin America, although products are
exported to other countries.  The acquisition during fiscal 1994 of the
Culinar, Inc. jam division in Quebec significantly expanded the Company's
presence in the Canadian market.  International sales now represent
approximately 11% of total Company sales.

  SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.  The fruit raw materials used by
the Company in the production of its food products are generally purchased from
independent growers and suppliers, although the Company grows some strawberries
for its own use.  Because of the seasonal nature and volatility of quantities
of most of the crops on which the Company depends, it is necessary to prepare
and freeze stocks of fruit, fruit juices, berries and other food products and
to maintain them in cold storage warehouses.  Sweeteners, peanuts, and other
ingredients are obtained from various other sources.

  PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.  The Company's products are marketed under several
trademarks owned by the Company.  The principal trademarks of the Company 
include:  "SMUCKER'S", "MRS. SMITH'S", "THE R. W. KNUDSEN FAMILY", "MARY 
ELLEN", "LOST ACRES", "SIMPLY FRUIT", "DUTCH GIRL", "GOOD MORNING", "EXTRA 
FRUIT", "DOUBLE FRUIT", "J. M. SMUCKER'S", "SUPER SPREADERS", "LOW SUGAR", 
"GOOBER", "MAGIC SHELL", "SPECIAL RECIPE", "SUNDAE SYRUP", "RECHARGE", "AFTER
THE FALL", "SANTA CRUZ NATURAL", "DICKINSON'S", "SPRITZER", "FRUIT TEAZER", 
"TEAKOOLER", "HEINKE", and "FRUITAGE".  In addition, the Company licenses the 
"IXL", "SHIRRIFF", "SCHWARTAU", and "VACHON" brands.
<PAGE>   3

  Other slogans or designs considered important trademarks to the Company
include:  "With a name like SMUCKER'S, it has to be good," "SMUCKER'S" banner,
the Crock Jar shape, Gingham design, and strawberry logo.

  SEASONALITY.  Historically, the Company's business has not been highly
seasonal.  However, due to the demand for frozen pies during the fall and
holiday season, the Company expects the addition of "MRS. SMITH'S" to
significantly impact its second and third quarter results.

  WORKING CAPITAL.  Working capital requirements are greatest during the late
spring and summer months due to seasonal procurement of fruits, berries, and
peanuts.  During this period, short-term borrowing may be used to augment
working capital generated by sales.

  CUSTOMERS.  The Company is not dependent either on a single customer or on a
very few for a major part of its sales.  No single domestic or foreign customer
accounts for more than 10% of consolidated sales.

  ORDERS.  Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the
backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time is not material.

  GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.  The Company has no material portion of its business
which may be subject to negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at
the election of the government.

  COMPETITION.  The Company is the leading manufacturer of fruit spreads,
toppings, and frozen pies in the United States.  The Company's business is
highly competitive as all its brands compete for retail shelf space with other
advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products.  The rapid growth of alternative store formats (i.e.  Warehouse Club
and Mass Merchandise stores) and changes in business practices, resulting from
both technological advances and new industry techniques, have added additional
variables for companies in the food industry to consider in order to remain
competitive.  The principal methods of and factors in competition are product
quality, price, advertising, and promotion.

  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  Compliance with the provision of federal, state and
local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials
into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to
have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive
position of the Company.

  EMPLOYEES.  At April 30, 1994, the Company had approximately 2,600 full-time
employees, worldwide.

  SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.  Information concerning international
operations for the years 1994, 1993, and 1992 is hereby incorporated by
reference from the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, on page 20 under Note B:
"Operating Segments."

                           THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY

                  RESTRICTED STOCK BONUS PLAN AS AMENDED AS TO

               148,600 CLASS A AND 148,600 CLASS B COMMON SHARES

                                AUGUST 28, 1991

              [The Restricted Stock Bonus Plan as Amended (the "Plan") amends
and combines the Restricted Stock Bonus Plan as to 25,000 Common Shares [Sixth
Year End Lapse] dated August 15, 1979 and the Restricted Stock Bonus Plan as to
50,000 Common Shares [Sixth-Tenth Year End Lapses] dated August 15, 1979 (the
"Original Plans").  The terms of the Plan apply to all shares awarded to date
under the Original Plans as well as to those awarded hereafter under the Plan.]

              1.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of the Plan is to provide a means for
the Company to make awards to key employees of the Company and of its
affiliates, including officers and directors who are employees, of restricted
stock bonuses of Common Shares of the Company, thereby giving these employees
an interest in the Company's business, an additional incentive to work for its
continued success, and a further reason to remain in the employ of the Company
or of its affiliates.  The term "affiliates" where used in the Plan means
subsidiary corporations as defined in Section 425 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

              2.  ADMINISTRATION.  The Plan shall be administered by the
Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Committee").  The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe
and interpret the provisions and to supervise the administration of the Plan,
and all decisions and designations made by the Committee pursuant to the
provisions of the Plan shall be final.

              3.  DESIGNATION OF EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN. The
employees to whom restricted stock bonuses are awarded (the "Recipients") shall
be designated, from time to time, by the Committee.  A restricted stock bonus
may be awarded to any full-time, salaried, key employee of the Company or of an
affiliate.

              4.  NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.  The aggregate number
of Common Shares that may be awarded as restricted stock bonuses under the Plan
shall not exceed 148,600 Class A Shares and 148,600 Class B Shares.  The Common
Shares to be awarded under the Plan shall be the Company's authorized Common
Shares, without par value, and may be unissued shares or treasury shares as the
Committee, with the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Company, may
from time to time determine.  To the extent the Company shall reacquire
<PAGE>   2
Common Shares for such purposes, the shares may be reacquired at the time
restricted stock bonus awards are made, or from time to time in advance,
whenever the Board of Directors of the Company may deem the purchase advisable.
If any Common Shares subject to the Restrictions provided in Paragraph 5 below
are forfeited to the Company, those Common Shares shall not again be available
for the award of restricted stock bonuses under the Plan unless the Recipient
of those Common Shares did not at any time prior to the forfeiture receive the
benefits of the ownership thereof (other than the right to vote them).

              5.  NATURE OF RESTRICTIONS.  The stock bonus shares involved in
each award will be subject to a restriction (the "Restriction") providing that:

                      (a)  Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 7 below with
              respect to earlier release of the Restriction, (i) the shares
              shall be forfeited to the Company in the event the Recipient of
              the award terminates full-time employment with the Company before
              the fourth anniversary of the award, unless the termination is by
              reason of disability, death, or retirement (with the prior
              express approval of the Committee) after the Recipient has
              attained 60 years of age, in each of which events the Restriction
              will lapse immediately or at such other time or times as the
              Committee shall determine; (ii) during the period when the
              Restriction is applicable to the shares, the shares shall not be
              transferable by the Recipient except by way of gift; and (iii)
              any shares so transferred shall, in the hands of any transferee,
              remain subject to the Restriction to the same extent as if the
              shares had remained in the hands of the Recipient.

                      (b)  Share certificates representing shares subject to
              the Restriction shall bear a legend identifying the Restriction.

                      (c) Any Common Shares of the Company, of whatever class,
              issued on or with respect to stock bonus shares awarded under the
              Plan, whether such issuance is pursuant to a stock distribution,
              split, dividend, or otherwise, shall be subject to the
              Restriction to the same extent and for the same period as the
              stock bonus shares on or with respect to which they are so
              issued.


              6.  NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK BONUS.  Promptly after the
Committee awards a restricted stock bonus to a Recipient, the Committee shall
cause the Recipient to be notified of the award.  The date on which the
Committee approves the award of a restricted stock bonus shall be considered to
be the date on which the restricted stock bonus is awarded unless the Committee
designates a later date as the award date.
<PAGE>   3
              7.  ACCELERATION OF RELEASE OF RESTRICTIONS.  If a Recipient of
an award (any of whose shares remain subject to the Restriction) (a) shall have
received advice of a lease, sale, or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company to other corporations, firms, or individuals
or (b) shall have received advice of a merger, consolidation, combination [as
defined in Section 1701.01(Q), Ohio Revised Code], or majority share
acquisition [as defined in Section 1701.01(R), Ohio Revised Code] involving the
Company and as a result of which the holders of shares of the Company prior to
the transaction become, by reason of the transaction, the holders of such
number of shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation as entitle them to
exercise less than one-third of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring
corporation in the election of directors, the Recipient shall in either such
event have the right to require the Company (or the surviving or acquiring
corporation), upon his or her written notice, to release the Restriction.

              8.  RETURN OF CERTIFICATE.  In the event a Recipient forfeits
shares to the Company pursuant to Paragraph 5 above, the Recipient shall
deliver to the Company the certificate(s), in transferable form, evidencing the
shares subject to the Restrictions.  The Company may, as a condition precedent
to the delivery to the Recipient of share certificates evidencing restricted
stock bonuses, require the Recipient to agree in writing to be bound by the
provisions of the Plan, including the provisions of this paragraph 8.

              9.  ASSIGNABILITY.  As provided in Paragraph 5 above, shares
subject to the Restriction may not be transferred except by gift, and any
shares so transferred shall, in the hands of any transferee, remain subject to
the Restriction to the same extent as if the shares had remained in the hands
of the Recipient.

              10.  ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN SHARES.  In the event of any
change in the Common Shares subject to the Plan, by reason of a merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock
split-up, combination, or exchange of shares, or other change in the corporate
structure of the Company, the aggregate number of Common Shares then subject to
the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors.  The number
of restricted stock bonus shares awarded to a Recipient shall be appropriately
adjusted for any stock split-up effective, or share dividend distributed,
subsequent to the date of award and prior to the issuance or transfer of shares
pursuant to the award, and cash dividends payable after the date of the award
but prior to the issuance or transfer of shares shall be payable to the
Recipient.
<PAGE>   4
              11.  ACQUISITION FOR INVESTMENT.  Each employee receiving Common
Shares hereunder may be required by the Company, in its sole discretion, to
give a representation that he or she is acquiring the shares other than with a
view to the distribution thereof.  The Company may release any investment
representation obtained if it subsequently determines that the representation
is no longer required to insure that a sale or other disposition of the shares
would not involve a violation of the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or of applicable state blue sky laws.

              12.  COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS AND EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS.
No award of a restricted stock bonus shall be made and no certificates for
shares subject to the Restriction shall be issued or transferred until the
Company shall have taken such action, if any, as is then required to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the Ohio Securities Act, as
amended, and of any other applicable state blue sky laws, and with the
requirements of any exchange on which the Common Shares may, at the time, be
listed.

              13.  TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN.  The Board of
Directors may terminate, modify, or suspend the Plan with respect to
prospective awards, except that no modification shall, without shareholder
approval, increase the maximum number of shares that may be awarded as
restricted stock bonuses or modify the terms regarding the lapse of
restrictions.

              14.  TAX WITHHOLDING.  If the Company shall be required to
withhold any federal, state, or local tax in connection with an award of shares
under the Plan or upon the lapse of the restrictions provided in Paragraph 5,
above, it shall be a condition to such award or lapse that the Recipient pay or
make provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of all such taxes.  The
Recipient may request that all or any part of such withholding requirement be
satisfied by retention by the Company of a portion of the shares awarded or by
surrender to the Company of a portion of the shares with regard to which the
restrictions are lapsing, as applicable.  If such request is approved by the
Committee, the shares so retained or surrendered shall be credited against such
withholding requirement at the fair market value on the date of award or lapse,
as the case may be.  The Recipient may also make similar arrangements with the
Company with respect to the payment of taxes in excess of the withholding
requirement.

entirety, effective May 1, 1994.

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   ---------
                                  DEFINITIONS
                                  -----------

           For the purposes hereof, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings indicated:

           1.         The "Plan" means the supplemental retirement benefit plan

from any merger or consolidation of The J. M. Smucker Company with any other
corporation or corporations.

           5.         A "Participant" means a key executive of the Company or

           6.         The "Retirement Plan" means The J. M. Smucker Company
Employees' Retirement Plan.

           7.         The "final average monthly salary" of a Participant means
the Participant's "average monthly base compensation" under the Retirement Plan
but determined using the highest aggregate base compensation, incentive
compensation, deferred compensation and bonuses received by the Participant
during any 60 consecutive full calendar months within the period of 120

would receive at age 62 on the





                                       2

assumption that from and after the date of his retirement or termination the
Participant will receive no further compensation which is treated as wages for
purposes of the Act.  Provided, however, if an Employee previously had retired
due to permanent and total disability and was entitled to receive long-term
disability benefits under any plan maintained by an Employer, computation of
his monthly Primary Insurance Amount upon subsequent retirement under the Plan
shall be based on the Act in effect on his date of disability retirement and on
the assumption that from and after the date of his disability retirement, he
had continued to receive compensation which was treated as wages for purposes
of the Act at the rate of monthly compensation which was in effect immediately
prior to the date of his disability retirement throughout any period during
which he received Years of Service under the Plan on account of such disability
retirement.  All estimates hereunder shall be made by the Company, upon the
advice of an actuary, using standards of uniform and non-discriminatory
application.

Participant's years of "benefit service" under the Retirement Plan but
determined including any periods of employment after his normal retirement
date.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   ----------
                        SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS
                        --------------------------------

           1.         NORMAL RETIREMENT.  A Participant who retires from
employment with his Employer on or after his normal retirement date, or who has
left active employment prior to his normal retirement date under conditions of
eligibility for a long-term disability benefit under any plan maintained by an
Employer and is receiving long-term disability benefits on his normal
retirement date, shall be eligible for a monthly supplemental normal retirement
benefit in an amount equal to:

           (a)        two and one-half percent of his final average monthly
           salary multiplied by his Years of Service, not to exceed 20 
           years,
                                      less
           (b)        100 percent of his Social Security Offset Amount,
                                      less
           (c)        the amount of his monthly retirement benefit under the
           Retirement Plan.

           A monthly supplemental normal retirement benefit shall be paid to an
eligible Participant commencing as of the first day of the month following the
month in which he retires and shall be payable monthly thereafter during his
life, the last payment being for the month in which his death occurs.

           Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who is still employed
by an Employer on the April 1 following the calendar year in which he attains
age 70-1/2 shall commence





                                       4
<PAGE>   5
receiving the monthly supplemental normal retirement benefit provided under
this Section 1 of Article II as of the April 1 following the calendar year in
which he attains age 70-1/2.

           2.         EARLY RETIREMENT.  A Participant who retires from
employment with his Employer at or after age 55, but prior to his normal
retirement date, who has at least ten Years of Service, and who is not eligible
for a short- or long-term disability benefit under any plan maintained by an
Employer, shall be eligible for a monthly supplemental early retirement benefit
in an amount determined at his early retirement in the same manner as provided
for a monthly supplemental normal retirement benefit, except that the amount
determined in (a) shall be reduced by one-third of one percent for each full
month by which commencement of payment of the benefit precedes the month
following the date on which the Participant attains age 62.  A monthly
supplemental early retirement benefit shall be paid to an eligible Participant
commencing as of the first day of the month following the month in which he
retires and shall be payable monthly thereafter during his life, the last
payment being for the month in which his death occurs.

           3.         TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  The Plan is intended to
provide benefits for career employees of an Employer.  Therefore, a Participant
who terminates his employment with his Employer for any reason other than death
and who is not eligible for any retirement benefit under the Plan or a short-
or long-term disability benefit under any plan maintained by an Employer, shall
not be eligible for any supplemental retirement benefit under the Plan, except
that the Company may, in its discretion, determine that such a Participant, who
has at least ten Years of Service, is eligible for a monthly supplemental
deferred retirement benefit in an amount determined at his termination of





                                       5
<PAGE>   6
employment in the same manner as provided for a monthly supplemental early
retirement benefit.  A monthly supplemental deferred retirement benefit shall
be paid to an eligible Participant commencing as of the first day of the month
following the month in which he attains age 55 and shall be payable monthly
thereafter during his life, the last payment being for the month in which his
death occurs.

           4.         JOINT AND SURVIVOR FORM OF PAYMENT.  A Participant who
becomes eligible to receive a monthly supplemental retirement benefit and who
is married at the time payment of his monthly supplemental retirement benefit
commences shall receive payment of such benefit in the form of a qualified
joint and survivor annuity that in the event of the Participant's death would
provide a benefit to the Participant's surviving spouse equal to 50 percent of
the benefit the Participant was receiving at the time of his death.  To receive
a benefit under the qualified joint and survivor form of payment, a
Participant's surviving spouse must be the same spouse to whom the Participant
was married at the time payment of his monthly supplemental retirement benefit
commenced.  The present value of the qualified joint and survivor annuity
payable to a Participant hereunder shall be the actuarial equivalent of the
present value of the benefit otherwise payable to him under the Plan.

                                  ARTICLE III
                                  -----------
                               SURVIVOR BENEFITS
                               -----------------

           If a Participant who has at least ten Years of Service should die
after his retirement or termination of employment but prior to the commencement
of benefit payments under the Plan, and if the Participant had a surviving
spouse as defined in the Retirement Plan, the surviving spouse shall be
eligible for payments as if the Participant had effectively





                                       6
<PAGE>   7
elected the 50 percent joint and survivor option described under the Retirement
Plan and designated his spouse as his Contingent Annuitant, commencing at the
earliest date that the Participant would have been eligible for payments if the
Participant had survived.

           If a Participant who has at least ten Years of Service should die
prior to retirement or termination of employment, and if the Participant had a
surviving spouse as defined in the Retirement Plan, the surviving spouse shall
be eligible for payments as if the Employee had retired or terminated on the
day before his death.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                   ----------
                               SPECIAL CREDITING
                               -----------------

           Employees who are Participants under the Plan as of its effective
date of January 1, 1985 automatically will be credited with 20 Years of Service
as of the date of retirement.

                                   ARTICLE V
                                   ---------
                                 ADMINISTRATION
                                 --------------

           The Company shall be responsible for the administration of the Plan.
The Company shall have all such powers as may be necessary to carry out the
Plan, including the power to determine all questions relating to eligibility
for and the amount of any benefit and all questions pertaining to claims for
benefits and procedures for claim review; to resolve all other questions
arising under the Plan, including any questions of construction; and to take
such further action as the Company shall deem advisable in the administration
of the Plan.  The actions taken and the decisions made by the Company hereunder
shall be final and binding upon all interested parties.

                                   ---------- 
                                    FUNDING
                                    -------

           Benefits under the Plan shall be paid out of the general assets of
the Employers including any trust or fund created for that purpose.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                  -----------
                           AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
                           -------------------------

           The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any
time by action of its Board of Directors.  Notwithstanding any such action, the
Company shall be obligated to pay any benefits already accrued to any
Participant under the Plan at the date of amendment or termination of the Plan
and to continue making payments in the amounts determined to any retired
Participant or his beneficiary, and shall be obligated to pay benefits in
amounts not less than the benefits to which a Participant or his beneficiary
would be entitled hereunder upon retirement, death or other termination of
employment at the time of such amendment or termination.  If a trust is being
used to fund assets under the Plan and the Plan is terminated, any excess
assets remaining in the trust after the full value of benefits already accrued
to Participants under the Plan have been paid to such Participants or their
beneficiaries shall revert to the Company.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                  ------------
                                 MISCELLANEOUS
                                 -------------

           1.         NON-ALIENATION OF RETIREMENT RIGHTS OR BENEFITS.  Neither
the Participant nor any beneficiary shall encumber or dispose of his right to
receive any payments





                                       8
<PAGE>   9
hereunder, which payments or the right thereto are expressly declared to be
non-assignable and non-transferable.  If a Participant or beneficiary without
the written consent of the Company attempts to assign, transfer, alienate or
encumber his right to receive any payment hereunder, or permits the same to be
subject to alienation, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind,
then thereafter during the life of such Participant or of such beneficiary, as
the case may be, and also during any period in which any Participant or
beneficiary is incapable in the judgment of the Company of attending to his
financial affairs, any payment which the Company is required to make hereunder
may be made, in the discretion of the Company, directly to him or to such
beneficiary or to any other person for his use or benefit or that of his
dependents, if any, including any person furnishing goods or services to or for
his use or benefit or the use of benefit of his  dependents, if any.  Each such
payment may be made without the intervention of a guardian, the receipt of the
payee shall constitute a complete acquittance to the Company with respect
thereto, and the Company shall have no responsibility for the proper
application thereof.

           2.         NO EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEED.  Nothing herein contained shall
be construed as a commitment or agreement on the part of any person employed by
the Company or any subsidiary to continue his employment with the Company or
any subsidiary, and nothing herein contained shall be construed as a commitment
on the part of the Company or any subsidiary to continue the employment or the
annual salary rate of any such person for any period, and all Participants
shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan was never
put into effect.

           3.         INTEREST OF PARTICIPANT.  The obligation of the Company
under the Plan to provide the Participant with





                                       9
<PAGE>   10
benefits hereunder merely constitutes the unsecured promise of the Company to
make payments as provided herein, and the Participant shall have no interest
in, and no lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company or of any
subsidiary.

           4.         CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS.  The provisions of the Plan
shall in no event be construed as giving any person, firm or corporation, any
legal or equitable rights as against the Company, its officers, employees, or
directors, except any such rights as are specifically provided for in the Plan
or are hereafter created in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

           5.         NO COMPETITION.  The right of any Participant, surviving
spouse, or other beneficiary to a supplemental retirement benefit under the
Plan will be terminated, or, if payment thereof has begun, all further payments
will be discontinued and forfeited, in the event the Participant (i) at any
time wrongfully discloses any secret process or trade secret of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) engages, either directly or indirectly, as an
officer, trustee, employee, consultant, partner, or substantial shareholder, on
his own account or in any other capacity, in a business venture within the
ten-year period following his retirement or termination of employment that the
Company's Board of Directors reasonably determines to be competitive with the
Company to a degree materially contrary to the Company's best interest.

           6.         SEVERABILITY.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
particular provision of the Plan shall not affect any other provision hereof,
and the Plan shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or
unenforceable provision were omitted herefrom.

           7.         GOVERNING LAW.  The Plan shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Ohio.

           8.         SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  The Plan and the obligations
created hereunder shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and
assigns.

           9.         DISHONEST CONDUCT OF A PARTICIPANT.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, if a Participant's employment
with an Employer is terminated because the Company determines the Participant
(i) engaged in dishonest or fraudulent acts against an Employer, (ii) willfully
injured property of an Employer, (iii) conspired against an Employer, or (iv)
disclosed confidential information concerning an Employer, then no supplemental
retirement benefit shall be payable to the Participant or his surviving spouse
under the Plan.

           EXECUTED at Orrville, Ohio, this first day of May, 1994.

                                                        Exhibit 10(c)

                           THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY

                             1987 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                                  (as amended)


     1.      The total number of shares which may be issued and sold
under options granted pursuant to this Stock Option Plan shall not exceed
1,600,000 of the Company's Class A Common Shares and 1,600,000 of the Company's
Class B Common Shares, except to the extent of adjustments authorized by the
last sentence of Paragraph 5 of this Stock Option Plan.  Such shares may be
treasury shares or shares of original issue or a combination of the foregoing.

     2.       The Board of Directors of the Company may, from time to time and
upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, authorize the granting to
officers (including officers who are members of the Board of Directors) and to
other key employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries of options to buy
from the Company Common Shares and may fix the number of shares to be covered
by each such option.  Successive options may be granted to the same person
whether or not the option or options first granted to such person remain
unexercised.

     3.       Options granted under this Stock Option Plan may be (i) options
which are intended to qualify under particular provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code, as in effect from time to time, (ii) options which are not
intended so to qualify under the Internal Revenue Code, or (iii) combinations
of the foregoing.  No option shall run for more than ten years and one day from
the date granted.  No option shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Options shall be
exercisable during the optionee's lifetime only by him or her or, if the option
is not intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" by his or her
guardian or legal representative.

     4.       The option price shall not be less than the fair market value of
the shares covered by the option at the time the option is granted.  The option
price shall be payable (a) in cash or by check acceptable to the Company, (b)
at the discretion of the Board of Directors, by the transfer to the Company by
the optionee of Common Shares owned by the optionee for at least six months and
having a value at the time of exercise equal to the total option price, or (c)
by a combination of such methods of payment.

     5.       The Board of Directors may make or provide for such adjustments
in the option price and in the number or kind of Common Shares or other
securities covered by outstanding





                                       
<PAGE>   2



options as it in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, may determine is
equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of
optionees that would otherwise result from (a) any stock dividend, stock split,
combination of shares, recapitalization, or other change in the capital
structure of the Company, or (b) any merger, consolidation, separation,
reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, or issuance of rights or
warrants to purchase stock, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event
having an effect similar to any of the foregoing.  Specifically, but without
limitation, where any transaction or event referred to herein would result in a
change in the control of the Company, the Board of Directors, in its
discretion, may provide in substitution for unexercised options then
outstanding such alternative options or other consideration as it, in good
faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in
connection therewith the surrender of all such unexercised options.  The Board
of Directors may also make or provide for such adjustments in the number or
kind of Common Shares or other securities which may be sold under this Stock
Option Plan as it in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, may
determine is appropriate to reflect any transaction or event described in the
preceding sentence.

     6.       The form of each Stock Option Agreement shall be prescribed, and
any Stock Option Agreement evidencing an outstanding option may with the
concurrence of the affected optionee be amended, by the Board of Directors,
provided that the terms and conditions of each such Stock Option Agreement and
amendment are not inconsistent with this Stock Option Plan.

     7.       The Board of Directors may, with the concurrence of the affected
optionee, cancel any option granted under this Stock Option Plan.  In the event
of any such cancellation, the Board of Directors may authorize the granting of
new options (which may or may not cover the same number of shares that had been
the subject of any prior option) in such manner, at such option price and
subject to the same terms, conditions, and discretions as, under this Stock
Option Plan, would have been applicable had the cancelled options not been
granted.

     8.       This Stock Option Plan shall be administered by the Board of
Directors which may from time to time delegate all or any part of its authority
under this Stock Option Plan to a committee of the Board composed of not less
than three directors.  The members of the committee shall not be eligible, and
shall not have been eligible for a period of at least one year prior to their
appointment, to participate in this Stock Option Plan or in any other plan of
the Company or any affiliate entitling the participants therein to acquire

                                       2

stock, stock options, or stock appreciation rights where such participation
would cause that member not to be a "disinterested person" for purposes of Rule
16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor rule to the
same effect).  To the extent of such delegation, references in this Stock
Option Plan to the Board of Directors shall also refer to the committee.  The
majority of the committee shall constitute a quorum, and the action of a
majority of the members of the committee present at any meeting at which a
quorum is present, or acts unanimously approved in writing, shall be the acts
of the committee.

     9.       This Stock Option Plan may be amended from time to time by the
Board of Directors but without further approval by the shareholders of the
Company no such amendment shall increase the aggregate number of Common Shares
that may be issued and sold under this Stock Option Plan (except that
adjustments authorized by the last sentence of Paragraph 5 shall not be limited
by this provision) or change the designation in Paragraph 2 of the class of
employees eligible to receive options or cause Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (or any successor rule to the same effect) to cease to be
applicable to this Stock Option Plan.

     10.      If the Company shall be required to withhold any federal, state,
or local tax in connection the exercise of an option granted under this Stock
Option Plan, it shall be a condition to such exercise that the optionee pay or
make provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of all such taxes.  The
optionee may request that all or any part of such withholding requirement be
satisfied by retention by the Company of a portion of the shares purchased upon
exercise of such option.  If such request is approved by the Board of
Directors, the shares so retained shall be credited against such withholding
requirement at the fair market value on the date of exercise.  The optionee may
also make similar arrangements with the Company with respect to the payment of
taxes in excess of the withholding requirement.

This plan is designed to recognize key management members based on

is to reward key contributors who have an impact on the profit decisions of our

       on a percentage of the participant's salary range midpoint).

- - -      Actual award is limited to 175% of the participant's standard
       award.

- - -      The recommended award is determined by the Executive Committee
       and approved by the Executive Compensation Committee. The recommended 
       award is based on individual performance and time in the Plan.  
       
- - -      Awards are made on a cash basis.

Criteria for Participation
- - --------------------------

- - -      Key member of management team.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Shareholders
The J. M. Smucker Company


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The J. M.
Smucker Company as of April 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended April 30, 1994.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of The J. M.  Smucker Company at April 30, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended April 30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
  As discussed in Notes E and G to the consolidated financial statements, in
1993 the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes and
postretirement benefits other than pensions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations

Comparison of 1994 with 1993

The Company posted record sales in 1994 of $511,525,000, an increase of 4% over
the 1993 level of $491,309,000.  The inclusion of results from Canada Group
East and "Mrs. Smith's" since their respective dates of acquisition accounted
for the growth.

Total dollar sales within the Consumer business area were down slightly from
last year.  The most significant decline was in the price-competitive,
warehouse club store market where the recent consolidations among the major
chains in the market have resulted in a loss of previous distribution.  Within
the grocery market, volume declines in traditional fruitspreads and peanut
butter were somewhat offset by modest price increases on assorted items and
increased tonnage of "Simply Fruit" and "Low Sugar" fruitspreads, and dessert
toppings.  The growth in the toppings area was primarily due to the successful
introduction of "Sundae Syrups" in various regions throughout the United
States.  In the Company's beverage business, the recent introduction of
"Smucker Coolers" in the second half of the year helped build momentum and
permitted the beverage business to realize a modest increase over last year.

Sales within the International area were up nearly 50% over last year despite
the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.  Had exchange rates remained
constant with fiscal 1993, sales would have been approximately 6% higher.  All
of the increase in the International area occurred in the Canadian market as a
result of expanding the pre-acquisition Canadian business, now known as Canada
Group West, along with the previously mentioned Group East acquisition.  The
Latin American market more than doubled sales as the Company continued its
effort to develop the "Smucker" fruitspread business in Mexico and other Latin
America markets.  In the Australasian market, overall volume was down from last
year due to a poor apricot crop, which impacted fruit sales in the foodservice
and commercial markets, and to management's decision to phase out low emphasis
products.  The business in Elsenham, England continues to fall short of
management's expectations, and the Company will continue to explore
alternatives for improvement during fiscal 1995.
<PAGE>   5

In the Industrial business area, sales of formulated fruit products to other
consumer products companies realized another year of growth as the introduction
of several new products and the addition of new customers helped to broaden the
base of the formulated market.  Overall Industrial sales were down a modest 2%
as a result of the Company's decision to eliminate certain unprofitable frozen
fruit product lines.

The Company's Foodservice business, which services restaurants, hotels, and
other institutional customers, experienced another good year with volume growth
in the core business items of portion control and traditional fruitspreads.

In the Specialty Foods area, the smallest of the Company's business areas,
intense price competition and an overall decline in demand for gift items
resulted in a decrease in sales of 8% from the previous year.

Net income for 1994 was $30,498,000 or $1.05 per share compared to last year's
$32,945,000 or $1.12 per share (after recognizing the impact of the accounting
change for postretirement benefits).  The majority of the year-to-year
shortfall was attributed to two items - significant introductory advertising
expenditures in April for "Mrs. Smith's" new "SmartStyle" line of
thaw-and-serve desserts, and a decision by the Company to write off the
remaining $2,326,000 of goodwill associated with the Company's purchase of its
Elsenham Quality Foods Ltd. subsidiary in England.

The Company's gross profit was up slightly as a percentage of sales over last
fiscal year.  Excluding the impact of the Company's two acquisitions, which
operated at lower profit margins than the Company's average, the gross profit
of the existing business realized approximately a one percent increase in the
profit margin percentage.

Selling, distribution, and administrative costs increased at a greater rate
than sales, mostly due to increased spending in the marketing area.  As
mentioned above, the Company chose to execute an advertising program supporting
the introduction of the "SmartStyle" frozen dessert line.  This program had
been planned prior to the purchase date.  Additional marketing expenses were
incurred in support of the introduction of two new "Smucker" products, "Sundae
Syrups" and "Super Spreaders".  The write-off of the Elsenham goodwill also
contributed to the overall increase in costs.
<PAGE>   6

The use of cash to partially finance the Company's acquisitions resulted in
lower balances for investing purposes.  As a result, interest income was down
compared to prior year.  The impact of lower interest rates throughout most of
the year also contributed.  Interest expense increased as a result of the debt
financing associated with the "Mrs. Smith's" acquisition and a reduction in the
amount of capitalized interest.  The borrowed amount was $48,048,000 at April
30, 1994.

The Company's effective tax rate increased to 42.2% from 39.2% in 1993 due to
an increase in the federal statutory tax rate and an increase in items that are
not deductible for tax purposes, notably, the write-off of the Elsenham
goodwill.
<PAGE>   7

Comparison of 1993 with 1992


During 1993 net sales increased $7,837,000 or approximately 2% over 1992.
Although this growth rate was somewhat below recent years, earnings increased
10% over fiscal 1992 before the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 106.

Volume growth in the Industrial, Specialty Foods, and Foodservice strategic
business areas accounted for the sales increase.  Within the Industrial area,
strong sales of fruit-based ingredients to other consumer products companies
were responsible for the growth, continuing last year's trend.  The Specialty
Foods area realized the largest percentage increase in sales of any business
area as the Company continued to focus on expanding branded products within
this segment.  Volume gains in portion control, fruit spread, and dessert
topping items contributed to the growth in Foodservice.

Total sales in the Consumer area were essentially flat during the year as
overall fruitspread volume remained constant with 1992 levels, despite share of
market gains.  Within the grocery market, sales of the Company's "Simply Fruit"
product rebounded from 1992 to post strong growth in the highly competitive
"fruit-only" category.  Sales of toppings also grew, helping to offset a
downturn in peanut butter sales.  The Company realized substantial sales growth
in its warehouse club store and mass retail markets while a general softness in
the health and natural foods market contributed to a decline in sales of fruit
juice and beverage products.
<PAGE>   8

In the International area, sales fell below 1992 results due to declining
exchange rates, economic conditions, and competitive activity.  Conscious
decisions to de-emphasize sales of some lower margin items also contributed.
In Canada, U.S. dollar sales were comparable to last year as higher
distribution and introduction costs hindered market expansion.  In the
Australasia market, sales increased as the Henry Jones Foods organization
assumed responsibility for "Smucker" brands in the Pacific Rim region.  In the
United Kingdom, performance fell below expectations due to a soft economy, weak
pound sterling, and stiff competition.

Cost of products sold decreased as a percentage of net sales as the Company
benefited from lower costs on several key fruits and other raw materials and
from improved efficiencies at its manufacturing facilities.  In addition, there
was continued focus on cost reduction efforts company-wide.

Selling, distribution, and administrative costs increased at a rate consistent
with sales, as higher selling and merchandising costs were partially offset by
marketing expenditures which remained at fiscal 1992 dollar levels.  Corporate
administrative expenses increased slightly as a percent of net sales.

Interest income was down from last year due to lower interest rates in the
market and a decrease in interest income earned from other sources.  Interest
expense decreased due to the absence of short-term borrowing during the year
and the early retirement of a portion of long-term debt.

The increase in income taxes was consistent with the pre-tax income increase.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" during the fourth quarter, retroactive to May 1,
1992.  The cumulative effect of the adoption of this statement did not have a
material impact on the Company's results.
<PAGE>   9

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position as growth has
been financed through a balance of internally generated funds and limited debt.
Although the cash balance at April 30, 1994 has declined from last year due to
the impact of acquisitions, cash provided from operations was a positive
$55,172,000.  In addition to the acquisitions, capital expenditures of
$18,707,000 and the payment of dividends represented the greatest uses of cash
during the year.  Dividends declared on all Common Shares rose 8% to
$13,642,000 or $.47 per share.


In April 1994, the Company replaced its existing lines of credit with a
three-year revolving credit agreement.  Under the agreement, the Company can
borrow up to $125,000,000 to meet future working capital or growth
requirements.  With the exception of borrowing to finance a portion of the Mrs.
Smith's acquisition, the Company has been able to meet all other cash
requirements either through short-term borrowings or internally generated
funds.


Based on projected cash flows for 1995, the Company expects additional
borrowing against its revolving credit agreement.  The anticipated acquisition
of the "After The Fall" beverage business during the first quarter of fiscal
1995, along with seasonal purchases of fruit during the summer months, will
result in a substantial increase in borrowing during the first two quarters of
fiscal 1995.  Debt balances are expected to return to levels consistent with
April 30, 1994 by the end of the year.  Capital expenditures of $20,450,000 are
expected for 1995 as the Company continues to focus on modernization and
expansion of its facilities.  The Company expects the combination of cash
provided from operations and borrowings available under the revolving credit
agreement to be sufficient to meet all cash requirements in fiscal 1995.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The J. M. Smucker Company


Fiscal Years Ended April 30, 1994, April 30, 1993, and April 30, 1992

Note A:  Accounting Policies

  Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly-owned.  All significant intercompany transactions and accounts are
eliminated in consolidation.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The Company considers all short-term investments
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

  Financial Instruments:  The fair value of the Company's financial instruments
approximates their carrying amounts.
<PAGE>   16

                                                                      Exhibit 13



  Inventories:  The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or
market, with market considered as replacement value.  Cost is determined on the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of domestic inventories.
Inventories not on the LIFO method are valued principally by the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method.  If the FIFO method (which approximates current cost)
had been used for all inventories, the balances would have been $11,169,000 and
$11,015,000 higher than reported at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  Goodwill and Intangible Assets:  The excess cost over net assets of
businesses acquired and other intangibles, principally trademarks and patents,
are being amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging up to
40 years.  Accumulated amortization of goodwill and intangible assets at April
30, 1994 and 1993, was $10,228,000 and $8,434,000, respectively.

  Property, Plant, and Equipment:  Property, plant, and equipment are carried
at cost with depreciation computed over the estimated useful life by the
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods
for income tax purposes.
<PAGE>   17

                                                                      Exhibit 13

  Foreign Currency Translation:  Assets and liabilities of the Company's
foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date, while income and expenses are translated using average
rates.  Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.

  Net Income Per Common Share:  Net income per Common Share is based on the
weighted average number of the Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares
considered outstanding during the year.

  Reclassifications:  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to current year classifications.

Note B: Operating Segments

The Company operates in one industry:  the manufacturing and marketing of food
products.  The following presents information about operations in different
geographic areas:

Note C:  Acquisitions


On March 31, 1994, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the "Mrs. Smith's" frozen pie business from Mrs. Smith's Frozen
Foods Co., a subsidiary of Kellogg Company, for $84,102,000 (contract price of
$80,100,000 plus closing adjustments).  This business, located in Pottstown,
Pennsylvania, manufactures and markets branded frozen pies, desserts, and pie
shells under the "Mrs. Smith's" brand name.  The purchase price was paid from a
combination of debt financing and internally generated funds.  In connection
with the acquisition, the Company purchased $36,452,000 of intangible assets,
primarily trademarks and goodwill, and plans to amortize them over 40 years
using the straight-line method.

In July 1993, the Company purchased for $16,093,000 in cash, the jam, preserve,
and pie filling business of Culinar, Inc. of Canada.  In connection with this
acquisition, the Company purchased $7,159,000 of intangible assets, primarily
goodwill, and plans to amortize them over 20 years using the straight-line
method.

These acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, results of operations subsequent to the dates of acquisition
are included in the consolidated financial statements.

The acquisition of the Culinar business did not have a material impact on the
financial results of the Company.  Had the acquisition of "Mrs. Smith's"
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1993, proforma consolidated results would
have been as follows:

The proforma results are based on historical financial information provided by
Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co. and are adjusted to give effect to certain
costs, primarily interest expense, amortization of intangible assets,
depreciation on revalued property, plant, and equipment, and income taxes.
These unaudited results do not necessarily reflect the actual results which
would have occurred had the acquisition been completed at the beginning of
1993, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.

During April 1994, the Company signed a letter of intent with After The Fall
Products, Inc. to acquire its beverage business located in Brattleboro,
Vermont.  The transaction is subject to the execution of a purchase agreement
and other customary conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of
fiscal 1995.

</TABLE>

  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9% for 1994, 1993,
and 1992.  Plan assets consist of listed stocks and government obligations,
including 168,000 of both of the Company's Class A and Class B Common Shares at
April 30, 1994 and 1993.  The discount rate was 7.5% and 8% in 1994 and 1993,
respectively, while the rate of increase in future compensation levels used in
determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations
was 5.75% for both years.  Prior service costs are being amortized over the
average remaining service lives of the employees expected to receive benefits.
Included in the above table is the unfunded supplemental retirement benefit
plan which had a projected benefit obligation of $6,230,000 and $4,727,000 in
1994 and 1993, respectively.
  The Company also charged to operations approximately $675,000, $606,000, and
$675,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively, for contributions to foreign
pension plans and to plans not administered by the Company on behalf of
employees subject to certain labor contracts.  These amounts were determined in
accordance with foreign actuarial computations and provisions of those labor
contracts.  For those plans not self-administered, the Company is unable to
determine its share of either the accumulated plan benefits or net assets
available for benefits under those plans.

Note E:  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions


In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company sponsors several
unfunded defined postretirement plans which provide health care and life
insurance benefits to substantially all active and retired, domestic,
nonrepresented employees, their covered dependents, and beneficiaries.  These
plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and
contain other cost-sharing features, such as deductibles and coinsurance.
Covered employees generally are eligible for these benefits when they have
reached age 55 and attained 10 years of service.

During fiscal 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106).  This standard
requires that the estimated cost of postretirement benefits, principally
health care, be accrued over the period earned rather than expensed as
incurred.  The effect of adopting SFAS 106 resulted in the Company recognizing
a one-time charge to consolidated income of $4,454,000 ($.15 per share), net of
$2,704,000 of income tax benefit.

The discount rate assumption used to determine the actuarial present value of
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% in 1994 and 8% in
1993.  For 1995, the assumed health care cost trend rates were 11.8% for
participants under age 65 and 10.0% for participants age 65 or older.  Both
rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% in the year 2004.  The health
care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the
obligation and periodic cost reported.  A one percent annual increase in the
assumed cost trend rate in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of April 30, 1994 by $1,824,000 and the
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year by $253,000.

In addition, certain of the Company's active employees participate in
multi-employer plans which provide defined postretirement health care benefits.
The aggregate amount contributed to these plans, including the charge for
periodic postretirement benefit costs, totaled $1,436,000, $1,356,000, and
$1,185,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Note F:  Stock Benefit Plans

  ESOP:  The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust (ESOP)
for domestic, non-represented employees.  The Company has entered into loan
agreements with the Trustee of the ESOP for purchases by the Trustee in amounts
not to exceed a total of 1,200,000 unallocated Common Shares of the Company at
any one time.  These shares are to be allocated to participants over a period
of not less than 20 years.  No additional borrowings were made by the ESOP in
either fiscal year 1994 or 1993; $1,384,000 was borrowed during 1992.  All
existing and future loans bear interest at 1/2% over prime and will be payable
as shares are allocated to participants.  The Company incurred no net expense
in any of the three years.  The principal payments received from the ESOP in
1994, 1993, and 1992 were $183,000, $250,000, and $157,000, respectively.

  Savings Plan:  The Company offers an employee savings plan under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all domestic employees not covered by
collective bargaining agreements.  The Company's contributions under the plan
are based on a specified percentage of employee contributions.  Charges to
operations for this plan in 1994, 1993, and 1992 were $787,000, $736,000, and
$470,000, respectively.

  Restricted Stock:  The Restricted Stock Bonus Plan provides for issuance of
Common Shares to key employees.  There are 105,600 Class A and 148,600 Class B
Common Shares available for issuance under the plan at April 30, 1994.  Shares
awarded under this plan contain certain restrictions for four years relating,
among other things, to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment and
to transferability.

  Shares awarded are issued as of the effective date of the award and recorded
at market value.  A corresponding deferred compensation charge is expensed over
the period during which restrictions are in effect.  There were no awards made
during the fiscal year.  An award of 43,000 Class A Common Shares was made in
1993.

  Stock Options:  The Company has two stock option plans covering officers and
certain key employees.  Options granted under these plans become exercisable at
the rate of one-third per year beginning one year after the date of grant, and
the option price is equal to the market value on the effective date of the
grant.

  Changes in the stock option plans are as follows:

Note G:  Income Taxes

During 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This statement requires the use of the
asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income
taxes.  The Company previously accounted for income taxes in conformity with
APB 11.  The effect of this change in accounting method was not material to the
financial statements or results of operations.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting.  Significant components
of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 30, 1994 and
1993 are as follows:

  Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to foreign tax loss carry-
  forwards and other foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of

Note H:  Long-Term Debt

In April 1994, the Company replaced its short-term lines of credit with a
three-year $125,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility.  Borrowings under
the revolving credit facility were $48,048,000 at April 30, 1994.  Under the new
agreement, the Company is subject to certain covenants and restrictions
relating to current and interest coverage ratios, along with periodic payments
for commitment fees on the unused balance.  Interest rates are variable,
primarily based on money market, LIBOR, or prime.  The revolving credit
facility expires in 1997 and is extendible at the option of the Company with
the approval of the banks.

                                                                      Exhibit 13
Note I:  Leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings, and equipment for varying periods
of time, with renewal options.  Leases of cold storage facilities are
continually renewed for short periods.

Rental expense in 1994, 1993, and 1992 totaled $9,110,000, $8,552,000, and
$8,513,000, respectively; included therein were cold storage facility rentals,
based on quantities stored, amounting to $5,525,000, $4,538,000, and
$4,708,000, respectively.



Note J:  Common Shares

In August 1991, the shareholders of the Company approved Amended Articles of
Incorporation changing the Company's existing Common Shares into Class A Common
Shares and authorizing a new class of non-voting Common Shares, designated as
Class B Common Shares.  Subsequently, on September 30, 1991, the Company
distributed one share of the newly created Class B Common Shares for each Class
A Common Share then issued.

The Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation provide that but for certain
exceptions, those acquiring the Company's Class A Common Shares will be
entitled to cast one vote per share on matters requiring shareholder approval
until they have held their shares for four years, after which time they will be
entitled to cast ten votes per share.  The Company's Class B Common Shares are
non-voting, except under certain conditions outlined in the Company's Amended
Articles of Incorporation.
