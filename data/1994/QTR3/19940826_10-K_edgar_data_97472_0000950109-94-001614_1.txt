ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
          --------

(a)  General Development of Business

     Texas Industries, Inc. (the "Registrant" or "Company"), incorporated April
19, 1951, directly and through subsidiaries, is a producer of steel and
cement/concrete products for the construction and manufacturing industries. In
November 1985, the Registrant purchased the remaining 50% interest in Chaparral
Steel Company ("Chaparral").  Chaparral sold 5,940,000 shares of its common
stock in a public offering for approximately $83 million in July 1988.
Brookhollow owns commercially zoned land for investment, resale and other real
estate activities.

(b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments

     For a description of Registrant's industry segments, refer to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements entitled "Business Segments" on page 14 of the
Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended May 31, 1994,
incorporated herein by reference.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business


STEEL OPERATIONS

     Chaparral, an 81 percent-owned subsidiary, has operated a steel mill at
Midlothian, Texas, since 1975.  The steel operation follows a market mill
concept which entails the low cost production of a wide variety of products
ranging from reinforcing bar and specialty products to large-sized structural
beams.  Chaparral operates two electric arc furnaces with continuous casters
which feed a bar mill, a structural mill and a large beam mill which together
produce a broader array of steel products than a traditional mini-mill.
Finished products produced include beams, merchant quality rounds, special bar
quality rounds, rebar and channels. In fiscal year 1992, commissioning was
completed on the new large beam mill, with a rolling capacity exceeding 400,000
tons per year, which produces structural steel beams up to twenty-four inches
wide.  The current rated production capacity of the melting operation exceeds
1.5 million tons per year;  the rolling capacity is 2.0 million tons per year.
Approximately 1.4 million tons of finished products were produced in 1994.

     Chaparral's primary raw material is scrap steel, which includes shredded
steel.  A major portion of the shredded steel requirements are produced by the
shredder operation at the steel mill.  The shredded material is primarily
composed of crushed auto bodies purchased on the open market.  The supply of
scrap steel is expected to be adequate to meet future requirements.

     Chaparral's products are marketed in 44 states and to a limited extent in
Canada, Mexico, Western Europe, China and Japan.  Sales are primarily to the
construction industry and to the railroad, defense, automotive, mobile home and
energy industries.  Chaparral's principal customers are steel service centers,
steel fabricators, forgers and original equipment manufacturers.  No single
customer purchases ten percent or more of the sales volume within any one year.
Sales to affiliates are minimal.  Orders are generally filled within 45 days and
are cancelable.

     Chaparral competes with steel producers, including foreign producers, on
the basis of price, quality and service.  Certain of the foreign and domestic
competitors, including both large integrated steel producers and mini-mills,
have substantially greater assets and larger sales organizations than Chaparral.
Intense sales competition exists for substantially all of Chaparral's products.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
     Chaparral's steel mill consumes large amounts of electricity and natural
gas.  Electricity is obtained from a local electric utility under an
interruptible supply contract with six-month price adjustments which reflect
increases or decreases in the utility's fuel costs.  Natural gas is obtained
from a local gas utility under a supply contract.  Chaparral believes that
adequate supplies of both electricity and natural gas are readily available.

     Delivery of finished products is accomplished by common-carrier, customer-
owned trucks, rail and barge.  Chaparral also operates two distribution
facilities.  Currently, Chaparral does not place heavy reliance on franchises,
licenses or concessions.


CEMENT/CONCRETE

     The cement/concrete business segment includes the manufacture and sale of
cement, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, concrete pipe, block and brick.
Production and distribution facilities are concentrated in Texas and Louisiana
with markets extending into contiguous states.  The Registrant also has certain
patented and unpatented mining claims in Southern California which contain
deposits of limestone.

     Cement production facilities are located at two sites in Texas:  one at
Midlothian, approximately 25 miles south of Dallas/Fort Worth, which is the
largest cement plant in Texas, and the other at Hunter, approximately 40 miles
south of Austin.  The limestone reserves used as the primary raw material are
located on fee-owned property which is adjacent to each of these plants.  The
rated annual capacity and estimated minimum reserves of limestone for each of
these plants are as follows:

</TABLE>

     The cement plants produced approximately 2.0 million tons of finished
cement in 1994, 1.7 million tons in 1993 and 1.4 million tons in 1992.  Annual
shipments of finished cement to outside trade customers were approximately 1.6
million tons in 1994, 1.2 million tons in 1993 and 1.0 million tons in 1992.
Additional shipments of clinker were approximately .4 million tons in 1994, .6
million tons in 1993 and .5 million tons in 1992.

     The Registrant's principal marketing area for cement includes Texas,
Louisiana, Colorado, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.  Sales offices are maintained
throughout the marketing area and sales are made primarily for use in the
construction industry to numerous customers, no one of which would purchase ten
percent or more of the trade sales volume within any one year.  The major volume
of unit trade sales is of standard portland cement, although the Registrant
produces and markets a variety of specialty cements.

     The Registrant distributes cement from its plants by rail and truck to 8
distribution terminals located throughout the marketing area.

     The Registrant's aggregate business, which includes sand, gravel, crushed
limestone and expanded shale and clay, is conducted from facilities primarily
serving Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin and Houston, Texas, and Alexandria, New
Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Monroe, Louisiana, areas.  The following table
summarizes certain information about the Registrant's aggregate production
facilities:

</TABLE> 

     The reserves shown above are contained on 26,728 acres of land, 12,090
acres of which are owned in fee by the Registrant and the remainder of which are
leased.  The expanded shale and clay plants operated at 80 percent of capacity
for 1994 with sales of approximately 928,000 cubic yards.  Production for the
remaining aggregate facilities was 79 percent of practical capacity and sales
for the year totaled 10.8 million tons, of which approximately 8.0 million tons
were shipped to outside trade customers.

     Sales of these various aggregates are generally related to the level of
construction activity within close proximity of the plant location.  The cost of
transportation limits the marketing of these products to the areas relatively
close to the plant sites.  These products are marketed by the Registrant's sales
organization located in the areas served by the plants and are sold to numerous
customers, no one of which would be considered significant to the Registrant's
business.  The distribution of these products is provided to trade customers
principally by contract and customer-owned haulers, and a limited amount of
these products is distributed by rail for affiliated usage.

     The Registrant's ready-mix concrete operations are located in three areas
in Texas (Dallas/Fort Worth, East Texas and Houston) and four areas in Louisiana
(New Orleans, Alexandria, Shreveport and Monroe).  The following table
summarizes various information concerning these facilities:

</TABLE>

     The plants listed above are located on sites owned and leased by the
Registrant.  The Registrant manufactures and supplies a substantial amount of
the cement and aggregates used by the ready-mix plants with the remainder being
purchased from outside suppliers.  Ready-mix concrete is sold to various
contractors in the construction industry, no one of which would be considered
significant to the Registrant's business.

     The plant sites for the above products (except for one that is leased) are
owned by the Registrant.  The products are marketed by the Registrant's sales
force in each of these locations, and are primarily delivered by trucks owned by
the Registrant.  Because the cost of delivery is significant to the overall cost
of most of these products, the market area is generally restricted to within
approximately one hundred miles of the plant locations.  These products are sold
to various contractors, owners and distributors, none of which would be
considered significant to the Registrant's business.

     Currently, Registrant does not place heavy reliance on patents, franchises,
licenses or concessions related to its cement/concrete segment.  The
Registrant's cement plants and expanded shale and clay plants can burn either
coal, natural gas or other high BTU fossil fuels.

     In most of the Registrant's principal markets for concrete products, the
Registrant competes vigorously with at least three other vertically integrated
concrete companies.  The Registrant believes that it is a significant
participant in each of the Texas and Louisiana concrete products markets.  The
principal methods of competition in concrete products markets are quality and
service at competitive prices.

     The Registrant is involved in the development of its surplus real estate
and real estate acquired for development of high quality industrial, office and
multi-use parks in the metropolitan areas of Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston,
Texas and Richmond, Virginia.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various
federal and state environmental laws and regulations.  Under these laws the U.
S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and agencies of state government have
the authority to promulgate regulations which could result in substantial
expenditures for pollution control and solid waste treatment.  Three major areas
regulated by these authorities are air quality, water quality and hazardous
waste management.  Pursuant to these laws and regulations emission sources at
the Company's facilities are regulated by a combination of permit limitations
and emission standards of statewide application, and the Company believes that
it is in substantial compliance with its permit limitations and applicable laws
and regulations.

                                      -6-

     Chaparral's steel mill generates, in the same manner as other steel mills
in the industry, electric arc furnace ("EAF") dust that contains lead, chromium
and cadmium.  The EPA has listed this EAF dust, which Chaparral collects in
baghouses, as a hazardous waste.  Chaparral has contracts with reclamation
facilities in the United States and Mexico pursuant to which such facilities
receive the EAF dust generated by the steel mill and recover the metals from the
dust for reuse, thus rendering the dust non-hazardous.  In addition, Chaparral
is continually investigating alternative reclamation technologies and has
implemented processes for diminishing the amount of EAF dust generated.

     Under a permit, the Company substitutes recycled high BTU liquid waste
materials for fossil fuel, principally coal, at its Midlothian cement plant.
Use of these recycled materials not only diminishes the amount of air emissions
as compared to coal but contributes to the reduction of waste and to the
conservation of depleting natural resources.  The Company's part B permit
application to utilize these recycled materials is currently being processed by
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

     The Company intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the
environment but since many of these requirements are not fixed, presently
determinable, or are likely to be affected by future legislation or rule making
by government agencies, it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate
future costs or benefits of compliance and their effect on the Company's
operations, future net income or financial condition.  Notwithstanding such
compliance, if damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment
has been or is caused by the conduct of the Company's business or by hazardous
substances or wastes used in, generated or disposed of by the Company, the
Company may be held liable for such damages and be required to pay the cost of
investigation and remediation of such contamination.  The amount of such
liability could be material.  Changes in federal or state laws, regulations or
requirements or discovery of unknown conditions could require additional
expenditures by or provide additional benefits to the Company.


OTHER ITEMS

     The Registrant provides products for the construction industry.  It is not
uncommon for the Registrant to report a loss from its cement/concrete operations
in the quarter ending February due to adverse weather conditions.  The dollar
amount of Registrant's backlog of orders is not considered material to an
understanding of the business of the Registrant.

     Registrant's enterprise employs approximately 2,700 persons.

    Annual maturities of long-term debt for each of the five succeeding years
are $12.8, $16.6, $16.5, $16.4, and $15.9 million.

    The Company has available a bank line of credit of $25 million of which $4.4
million has been utilized to support letters of credit.  This line is due to
expire in November 1996.  The interest rate charged on borrowings is 1.75% over
LIBOR.  Commitment fees at an annual rate of 1/2 of 1% are paid on the unused
portion of this line.

    As a result of a sinking fund payment and a notice of redemption issued by
the Company, holders of $46.9 million of the Company's outstanding 9%
convertible subordinated debentures due in 2008 converted such debentures into
1,432,296 shares of the Company's common stock at $32.74 per share.

DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES

    The Company received cash dividends from subsidiaries of $6.4 million in
1994, and $4.8 million in 1993 and 1992.

RESTRICTED TRANSFER OF ASSETS FROM SUBSIDIARIES

    A subsidiary has loan covenants that restrict the transfer of assets by
loans, advances or dividends to the parent.  These covenants require that the
subsidiary maintain minimum levels of working capital, restrict loans and the
percentage of net income that can be distributed as dividends.  The restricted
net assets were $188.1 million and the restricted retained earnings were $35.7
million at May 31, 1994.  The retained earnings of subsidiaries included in the
consolidated retained earnings at May 31, 1994, were $24.5 million.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:

Net income for Fiscal Year 1994 equalled $25.8 million or $2.29 per share, up
substantially from the prior year's income of $1.1 million or $.11 per share.
The cement, aggregate and concrete operations continued to improve for the
fourth consecutive year while Chaparral earnings increased from the previous
year in spite of a difficult market for structural steel beams.

In the coming year, the positive trend in earnings is expected to continue as
the cement, aggregate and concrete operations benefit from the recovery in
construction activity in the Texas region. Chaparral's earnings will largely be
determined by structural steel beam market conditions.

CEMENT, AGGREGATE AND CONCRETE OPERATIONS

Operating profit of $46.7 million for 1994 compared with a level of $31.7
million for the previous year. Revenues for the segment were $244.9 million, a
26% increase over last year. Revenues for all product groups were up for the
year.

Favorable trends in Texas construction activity were maintained during the year
due to both increased residential building and street and highway construction.
Some modest improvement in commercial building was apparent as well. While by no
means representing a construction boom, this level of building activity served
to bring demand and supply for cement into balance for the first time since the
mid-eighties. As a result, cement prices have risen from the extremely low
levels of four years ago to levels that are more representative of markets
outside the region. Construction activity in the region had a similar impact on
the aggregate, ready-mix and other product groups of the segment.

The general recovery of the Texas economy, together with the benefits from free
trade with Mexico, are expected to result in continued growth in construction
activity. As the largest cement producer in Texas and one of the largest
producers of aggregates in the region, the segment is well positioned to take
advantage of this further growth.

STEEL OPERATIONS

Operating profit for Chaparral Steel was $35.5 million, up from last year's
level of $12.9 million. The increase in profit was due to both improved cost
efficiencies and a concentration on more desirable market areas and products.

Shipments of 1.36 million tons were 2% lower than in the previous year. Average
prices were up 12% as more sales were made in home market areas and as scrap
cost increases were passed along. Demand for Chaparral's primary product,
structural steel beams, remained at a low level during the year. There are
indications that commercial construction activity in the United States is
beginning to improve somewhat; however, a quick recovery is not currently
expected.

During Fiscal Year 1995, Chaparral will continue to focus on improving its
production operations, expanding its presence in the market for special bar
quality products and working on new applications for lightweight structural
steel beams.

Empowered employees continue to enhance the Company's competitive position in
both production and marketing. Self-directed work teams are being successfully
<PAGE>
 
implemented. Employees throughout the Company are establishing solid customer
bonds and developing new, value-added products to meet customer needs.

During 1994, $71 million of debt was replaced with lower interest rate
financing. In the spring, $47 million of subordinated debt was converted to
equity. Both of these events resulted in a significant improvement in financial
flexibility. These capital structure changes and the internal efforts discussed
above will give the Company the ability to expand in markets and products which
fit with our strengths as opportunities develop.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS & FINANCIAL CONDITION

GENERAL

The Company has two major business segments: steel and cement/concrete. The
steel operation produces beams, merchant quality rounds, special bar quality
rounds, reinforcing bars, and channels. The cement/concrete segment supplies
cement and aggregates, ready-mix, pipe, block and brick.

The steel plant follows a market mill concept which entails producing a wide
variety of products from steel scrap. Chaparral strives to be a low-cost
supplier and is able to change its product mix to recognize changing market
conditions or customer requirements. Steel products are sold principally to
steel service centers, fabricators, cold finishers, forgers and original
equipment manufacturers. Chaparral distributes primarily to markets in North
America and, under certain market conditions, to Europe and Asia.

The cement/concrete facilities are concentrated in Texas and Louisiana, with
markets extending into contiguous states. As a vertically integrated concrete
products supplier, TXI owns or leases more than 25,000 acres of mineral-bearing
land. Cement/concrete operations require large amounts of capital investment,
energy, labor and maintenance.

Corporate resources, which are excluded from operating profit, include the
president's office as well as certain financial, legal, environmental, personnel
and public ownership expenses, none of which are allocated to operations.
Brookhollow's real estate activities are also included in corporate resources.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET SALES

Consolidated 1994 sales achieved a record $707.1 million, an increase of 15%
over last year. Steel sales were up 10% due to 12% higher average selling
prices. Cement/concrete sales increased 26% on improved volumes and selling
prices of all primary products. Steel shipments of 1.36 million tons were
slightly lower than 1993. Product mix between the bar mill and structural mills
was substantially unchanged compared to 1993. Bar mill prices averaged 9%
higher, while structurals were up 13%. Steel pricing overall had trended up
until May, when a $20 per ton decrease in certain wide flange beams was
required. Wide flange beams are generally used in commercial buildings for which
demand has been flat for the last few years.

Strong demand for cement/concrete products permitted significantly greater
shipments of cement, aggregates and ready-mix, which comprise 82% of segment
sales. Cement prices averaged 6% higher, ready-mix was up 2% and, due to product
mix, average aggregate pricing was down 1%. Cement consumption in Texas reached
the in-state production capacity during the year, increasing 13% compared to the
prior year. Prices for cement/concrete products are expected to improve further
over the next year if demand remains strong.

Consolidated 1993 sales of $614.3 million increased 2% over 1992. Steel sales
were up 1% as average prices trended up on similar volume. Cement tons increased
20% with slightly higher prices. Ready-mix volume was down as highway projects
in Houston and Louisiana tailed off, although average unit pricing gained 4%.
Aggregate sales were improved by 8% greater volume and 7% better average price.

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD

Consolidated cost of products sold, including depreciation and amortization, was
$598.6 million on increased shipments of cement/concrete and higher steel scrap
costs. Chaparral's costs were $18.9 million higher at $414.2 million. Scrap
costs increased $18 per ton during the year. Cement costs were $5.8 million
higher in 1994 due to lower clinker sales than in 1993 (the profit from clinker
sales is credited as a reduction of costs). The 23% increase in cement tons and
21% increase in ready-mix volume account for the majority of the $34.6 million
increase in cement/concrete cost of products sold, which total $184.4 million
for the year. Unit production costs of ready-mix and aggregates were lower due
to higher production volumes and continuing operating efficiency improvements.

The 1993 cost, totaling $545.2 million, increased $2.8 million from 1992.
Chaparral depreciation and amortization added $5.3 million for the large beam
mill. Steel costs per ton were somewhat higher as a result of upgrading the
product mix with large beam products. Cement/concrete costs of sales declined
$13.1 million or 8%, due largely to the absence of Dolphin Construction
activities. Cement unit costs were lower due to higher production volumes and
added savings from resource recovery activities. These activities use waste
products to displace coal which would otherwise be consumed at the Midlothian
cement plant.

OPERATING PROFIT

Near record operating profit of $82.1 million resulted from steel operations
increasing by $22.6 million and cement/concrete improving by $15.0 million,
both compared to the prior year's level. Steel prices per ton averaged $36
higher against unit cost increases of $19. Operational selling, general and
administrative costs included $1.9 million additional for steel profit sharing.
Cement/concrete profits were enhanced by added shipments of all products in
combination with improved pricing. Operational SG&A was up $4.5 million in this
segment due to increased selling and technical support for resource recovery
activities.

Operating profit in 1993 was $44.6 million as steel profits declined by $12.1
million and cement/concrete advanced $9.5 million. The 1992 profit included an
$11 million land gain from disposing of a ready-mix plant site. Steel profits
in 1993 were decreased by $5.3 million additional depreciation expense of the
large beam mill, as well as higher costs of producing large beam products, which
in that year sold at depressed prices. Cement/concrete profits rose on greater
shipments of cement and aggregates, which both had improved unit costs.

SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME

Total selling, general and administrative expense, including both operations and
corporate, increased 10% to $47.3 million. Steel costs of $15.9 million
included $1.9 million in additional profit sharing and $1.6 million in severance
pay. These increases were offset by reductions in compensation and other
expenses following the 1993 restructuring. Cement/concrete costs increased $4.5
million due to expanded marketing for products and technical support for
resource recovery activities.

Consolidated other income increased $2 million to $8.6 million. Chaparral's
other income, at $3.4 million, was $1.3 million greater due in part to disposal
of certain assets. Cement/concrete other income of $3.1 million is comprised
largely of gains from the sale of retired transportation equipment. Corporate
other income of $2.1 million is comprised primarily of $1.5 million in
Brookhollow land gains and $1.3 million in investment income.
<PAGE>
 
Prior year's consolidated other income of $6.6 million is similarly constituted
of gains from routine asset retirement, land gains and investment income. The
$24 million 1992 amount contained an $11 million land gain from disposal of a
downtown Dallas plant site.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense reduced $6.4 million to $26.2 million; $5.1 million of
reduction came from TXI and $1.3 million from Chaparral. A major TXI refinancing
was completed in two phases during the year as $71 million in notes payable
were replaced in September with lower interest rate obligations. Additionally,
$40 million in consolidated notes were repaid during the year. In April, $46.9
million in convertible debentures were exchanged for common stock. Interest
expense on these debentures terminated in January. The Chaparral expense
reduction reflects continued, scheduled repayment of debt. The $1.5 million
increase in 1993 over 1992 was due to Chaparral capitalizing $3.4 million in
interest charges during 1992.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

With 1994 yielding the best operating cash and net income results in the last
several years, the Company's financial condition has continued to improve.
Shareholders' equity grew $70 million to $353 million while long-term debt
decreased by $96 million. The year end debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 33%
is the lowest in Company history. While working capital and cash balances were
about the same as last year, significant progress was made on accounts
receivable, considering that the same $77 million balance supports $93 million,
or 15%, more sales volume. Inventory increased by $18 million as steel
production outpaced shipments during the second half of the year.

Capital expenditures increased $6 million to $23 million, spent largely on
replacement items. An additional $18 million in capital items were added to
lease commitments in the cement/concrete segment. Capital expenditure plans for
1995 contemplate $50 million as each business segment envisions doubling the
pace of recent expenditures. An additional $12 million in upgrade projects and
replacement mobile equipment is projected to be leased.

Net debt retirement of $40 million, excluding the converted debentures,
represented the greatest use of cash. Repayment flexibility was achieved through
TXI's refinancing as maturities previously scheduled for 1995 and 1996 were
replaced with a six-year amortization. A credit line of $25 million was arranged
for TXI as a part of the refinancing, $4.4 million of which has been utilized to
support letters of credit. This line is due to expire in November 1996.
Chaparral has short-term credit facilities of $20 million, $15 million of which
was outstanding at May. This credit line is eligible to be renewed in January
1995.

The Company generally maintains a policy of financing major capital expansion
projects with long-term borrowing. Working capital, investments and replacement
assets are funded out of cash flow from operations. The Company expects current
financial resources and cash from 1995 operations to be sufficient to provide
funds for planned capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and other known
working capital needs for fiscal 1995. If additional funds are required to
accomplish long-term expansion of operations, management believes that funding
can be obtained through lending or equity sources to meet such requirements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Texas Industries,
Inc. (the Company) and all subsidiaries. The minority interest represents the
19.1% separate public ownership of Chaparral Steel Company (Chaparral).

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Provisions for depreciation
are computed generally using the straight-line method. Provisions for depletion
of mineral deposits are computed on the basis of the estimated quantity of
recoverable raw materials.

For cash flow purposes, temporary investments which have maturities of less than
90 days when purchased, are considered cash equivalents. Temporary investments
of $6.3 million at May 31, 1993, which are included in cash on the balance
sheets, exceed 90-day maturity.

Earnings per share are computed by deducting preferred dividends from net income
and adjusting for amortization of additional goodwill in connection with the
contingent payment for the acquisition of Chaparral, then dividing this amount
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
including common stock equivalents.

Goodwill, currently being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 40-year
period, is net of accumulated amortization of $9.9 million at May 31, 1994 and
$7.6 million at May 31, 1993. Management regularly reviews remaining goodwill
with consideration toward recovery through future operating results
(undiscounted) at the current rate of amortization.

The Company's policy for new facilities is to capitalize certain costs until the
facility is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Chaparral
began the commissioning of the large beam mill in February 1991. The mill was
substantially complete and ready for its intended use in the third quarter of
fiscal 1992 with a total of $15.1 million of costs deferred. The amounts of
amortization charged to income were $3 million, $3 million and $1 million in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, based on a five-year period.

The estimated fair value of each class of financial instrument as of May 31,
1994 approximates carrying value except for Chaparral's long-term debt. The fair
value of all long-term debt at May 31, 1994, estimated by applying discounted
cash flow analysis based on interest rates currently available to the Company
for such debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, is approximately
$218.2 million compared to the carrying amount of $202.4 million.

Certain amounts in the 1992 and 1993 financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the 1994 presentation.



WORKING CAPITAL

Working capital totaled $161.4 million at May 31, 1994, compared to $159.4
million at the prior year-end.

Notes and accounts receivable of $76.8 million at May 31, 1994, compared with
$76.7 million in 1993, are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables
of $4.6 million in 1994 and $4.2 million in 1993.

Inventories are stated at cost (not in excess of market) generally using the
last-in, first-out method (LIFO). If the average cost method (which approximates
current replacement cost) had been used, inventory values would have been higher
by $12.0 million in 1994 and $6.6 million in 1993.


Inventories are summarized as follows:

</TABLE> 

Annual maturities of long-term debt for each of the five succeeding years are
$31.1, $32.6, $28.6, $28.5 and $28.0 million.

The Company has available a bank line of credit of $25 million of which $4.4
million has been utilized to support letters of credit. This line is due to
expire in November 1996. The interest rate charged on borrowings is 1.75% over
LIBOR. Commitment fees at an annual rate of 1/2 of 1% are paid on the unused
portion of this line.

Chaparral has utilized $15 million of its $20 million available bank lines of
credit, which are due to expire in January 1995, if not renewed. Interest rates
on borrowings currently range from 4.69% to 4.88%. Commitment fees at an annual
rate of 3/8 of 1% are paid on the unused portions of these lines.

The loan agreements contain covenants which provide for minimum working capital,
restrictions on purchases of treasury stock, payment of dividends on common
stock, limitations on incurring certain indebtedness and making certain
investments. Under the most restrictive of these agreements, the aggregate
amount of annual cash dividends on common stock is limited based on the ratio,
excluding Chaparral, of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization plus dividends from Chaparral to fixed charges. Chaparral loan
agreements also restrict dividends and advances to its shareholders, including
the parent company, to $33.0 million as of May 31, 1994. The Company and
Chaparral are in compliance with all loan covenant restrictions.

As a result of a sinking fund payment and a notice of redemption issued by the
Company, holders of $46.9 million  of the Company's outstanding 9% convertible
subordinated debentures due in 2008 converted such debentures into 1,432,296
shares of the Company's common stock at $32.74 per share. Assuming these
convertible debentures had been converted as of June 1, 1993, supplemental
earnings per share for fiscal year 1994 would have been $2.20.

Property, plant and equipment, principally Chaparral's, carried at a net amount
of approximately $231.0 million at May 31, 1994 is mortgaged as collateral for
$37.6 million of secured debt. The Company's Chaparral stock is pledged as
collateral for the $71 million Senior note and the $25 million line of credit.

The amount of interest paid was $31.6 million in 1994, $33.4 million in 1993 and
$34.7 million in 1992. Interest capitalized totaled $3.4 million in 1992.

Effective June 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). An additional income
tax provision of $1,949,000 was recognized in 1994, due to federal tax
legislation enacted on August 10, 1993, which increased the corporate tax rate
to 35%.

The provision for 1992 deferred income taxes (prior to the adoption of SFAS 109)
was principally comprised of the tax effects of temporary differences as
follows: $3.2 million commissioning costs, $4.6 million real estate gains and
($7.0 million) net operating loss utilization.

The Company joins in filing a consolidated tax return with its subsidiaries.
Current and deferred tax expense is allocated among the members of the group
based on the net taxable income or loss of the individual member.

As of May 31, 1994, for tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards available for offset against both regular taxable income and
alternative minimum taxable income of approximately $6.1 million, which expire
in the years 1997 through 2000. The Company has general business tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $2.5 million which expire in the years 1995
through 2009. The Company made income tax payments of $9.7 million, $.4 million,
and $2.5 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions, furnace dust
disposal and wastewater discharge. The Company believes it is in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Notwithstanding
such compliance, if damage to persons or property or contamination of the
environment has been or is caused by the conduct of the Company's business or by
hazardous substances or wastes used in, generated or disposed of by the Company,
the Company may be held liable for such damages and be required to pay the cost
of investigation and remediation of such contamination. The amount of such
liability could be material. Changes in federal or state laws, regulations or
requirements or discovery of unknown conditions could require additional
expenditures by the Company.

The Company and subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the
normal course of business. In management's judgment (based on the opinion of
counsel) the ultimate liability, if any, from such legal proceedings will not
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a series of defined
contribution retirement plans. The amount of pension expense charged to costs
and expenses for the above plans was $1.5 million in 1994, $1.8 million in 1993,
and $1.7 million in 1992. It is the Company's policy to fund the plans to the
extent of charges to income.

INCENTIVE PLANS

All personnel employed as of May 31 share in the pretax income of the Company
for the year then ended based on predetermined formulas. The duration of the
plans is one year and is subject to annual renewal by the Company's Board of
Directors. The expense for these plans, included  in selling, general and
administrative, was $4.1 million, $1.8 million and $1.4 million for 1994, 1993,
and 1992, respectively.

Certain executives of Chaparral participate in a deferred compensation plan
based on a five-year average of earnings. Amounts recorded as expense
(reduction) under the plan were $(2.0) million, $(2.4) million and $(.6) million
for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.
<PAGE>

OPERATING LEASES

Total expense for operating leases for mobile equipment, office space and other
items (other than for mineral rights) amounted to $10.0 million in 1994, $9.6
million in 1993 and $9.9 million in 1992. Non-cancelable operating leases with
an initial or remaining term of more than one year totaled $20.8 million at May
31, 1994. Annual lease payments for the five succeeding years are $5.3 million,
$4.4 million, $3.1 million, $4.1 million and $.6 million.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Business segment information is on pages 4 and 5. Intersegment sales, which are
not material, are accounted for at prices comparable to normal trade customer
sales. Operating profit is total sales and revenue less operating costs and
expenses, excluding general corporate expenses and interest expense.
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets that are used in the Company's
operations in each segment. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and
temporary investments, real estate subsidiaries and other financial assets not
identified with a major business segment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Texas Industries, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1994. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Texas Industries,
Inc. and subsidiaries at May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended May 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
