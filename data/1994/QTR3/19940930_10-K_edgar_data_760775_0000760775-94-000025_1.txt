                             PART I


Item 1.   BUSINESS.

General

WLR Foods, Inc. (WLR Foods or the Company) is a fully-integrated poultry
processing company involved in the production, further processing
and marketing of turkey and chicken products, and the
distribution of poultry and meat products.  In addition, WLR
Foods manufactures ice for retail distribution and is a provider
of public refrigerated warehousing services.

WLR Foods markets more than 250 branded, as well as private
label, commodity and value-added poultry and related products to
selected retail, food service and institutional markets,
primarily in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions of the
United States and, to a lesser extent, the upper Midwest and
California.  WLR Foods exports to more than 40 countries, with
particular customer strength in the Far East, the Caribbean and
United States military installations.
 
WLR Foods is the combination of three poultry companies, Wampler
Foods, Inc., Horace W. Longacre, Inc. and Rockingham Poultry
Marketing Cooperative Incorporated, all of which had their
beginnings prior to 1945.  Wampler Foods, Inc. and Horace W.
Longacre, Inc. were combined in 1985, and Rockingham Poultry
Marketing Cooperative Incorporated was acquired in 1988.  Prior
to their consolidation on December 31, 1993, the Company operated
its poultry business through two major subsidiaries, Wampler-
Longacre Turkey, Inc. (Wampler-Longacre Turkey) and Wampler-
Longacre Chicken, Inc. (Wampler-Longacre Chicken).  

In April 1990, the Company acquired Cassco Ice & Cold Storage,
Inc. (Cassco), a public refrigerated warehouse and ice
manufacturing and distribution business.  WLR Foods also owns 65%
of May Supply Company, Inc. (May Supply), a wholesale distributor
of plumbing supplies and equipment.  In May 1993, WLR Foods
acquired assets of two ice manufacturing and distribution
companies located in the greater Washington, D.C. area and in
Richmond, Virginia.  These two operations have been integrated
into Cassco.

On November 27, 1992, WLR Foods acquired Round Hill Foods, Inc.
and affiliated companies (Round Hill), located in New Oxford,
Pennsylvania.  Round Hill is engaged in turkey production,
processing and marketing.

On January 1, 1994, Wampler-Longacre Turkey and Wampler-Longacre
Chicken  were merged into a single poultry company under the name
Wampler-Longacre, Inc. (Wampler-Longacre).  As a part of this
consolidation, Round Hill was also merged into Wampler-Longacre. 

<PAGE>

Poultry Production

WLR Foods controls the breeding, hatching, grow-out and
processing of its turkeys and chickens.  For fiscal 1994, WLR
Foods produced approximately 386 million pounds of dressed turkey
and 517 million pounds of dressed chicken.

     WLR Foods purchases breeder stock turkey eggs which it
hatches and places with growers who supply labor and housing to
produce breeder flocks.  These breeder flocks produce eggs that
are taken to the company-owned turkey hatchery for incubation and
hatching into poults. In its chicken operations, WLR Foods
purchases breeder flock chicks and places them with growers who
supply labor and housing to raise the birds.  The birds are then
moved to breeder farms where they begin providing eggs.  When
laid, eggs are transported to company-owned hatcheries.  Once
hatched, day-old poults and chicks are inspected and vaccinated
against common poultry diseases.  In total, WLR Foods contracts
with 146 breeder growers who grow most of WLR Foods' turkey, and
all of WLR Foods' chicken, breeder flocks.

     After hatching and vaccination, poults and chicks are
transported to one of WLR Foods' approximately 630 contract
growers located in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and
Maryland who supply labor and housing to raise the turkeys and
chickens to maturity.  WLR Foods supplies feed primarily from
company-owned feed mills and provides grower support through WLR
Foods' technicians and veterinarians.

     Grow-out and breeder farms provide WLR Foods with more than
38 million square feet of growing facilities.  These farms
typically are grower-owned, operate under contract with WLR
Foods, and provide facilities, utilities and labor.  Contract
growers are compensated on a cost-based formula and several
incentive-based formulas.  Approximately 80% of WLR Foods'
turkeys and 100% of its chickens are raised by contract growers,
with the balance grown by independent growers and company-owned
farms.  WLR Foods strives to maintain good contract grower
relationships and believes the availability of contract growers
is sufficient for anticipated needs.

     An important factor in the grow-out of poultry is the rate
at which poultry converts feed into body weight.  The Company
purchases its primary feed ingredients on the open market.  These
ingredients consist primarily of corn and soybean meal and
represent approximately 66% of WLR Foods' total cost to grow
turkeys and chickens and approximately 32% of its cost of sales
for fiscal 1994.  Because the quality and composition of feed is
critical to the feed conversion rate, WLR Foods formulates and
produces a majority of its own feed at one of its three feed
mills.  WLR Foods has annual feed manufacturing capacity in
excess of 1 million tons and anticipates no difficulty in meeting
the Company's feed  requirements in the future.

     Once the turkeys and chickens reach processing weight, they
are transported in WLR Foods' trucks to one of its six processing
plants.  These plants utilize modern, highly automated equipment
to process and package the turkeys and chickens for sale or
preparation for further processing.  WLR Foods further processes
bulk poultry by adding value beyond deponing and skinning, such 

<PAGE>

as slicing, grinding, marinating, spicing and cooking to produce
delicatessen products, frankfurters, meat salads, ground turkey
and chicken and food service products.

Distribution, Public Refrigerated Warehousing, Ice and Other

     WLR Foods' distribution business, with its warehousing and
transportation equipment, includes fresh poultry, beef, and other
meat products purchased from third parties for resale and is
conducted within a radius of approximately 75 miles of WLR Foods'
further processing facility in Franconia, Pennsylvania.  In
fiscal 1994, Cassco sold 21.8 million eight-pound equivalent bags
of retail ice, making it one of the largest ice manufacturers in
the mid-Atlantic region.  In addition, Cassco operates public
refrigerated warehouses at four locations.  WLR Foods' protein
conversion plants convert the nonedible by-products of its
poultry processing plants into feed ingredients, with the balance
sold to pet food manufacturers.

     The following table sets out sales revenues from WLR Foods'
products for the last three fiscal years.  

                            Fiscal 1994      Fiscal 1993       Fiscal 1992

Total Net Sales              $727.3         $616.7                $514.5

Competition 

     Poultry production requires continuous growing and
processing, with limited storage, making the poultry industry
highly competitive.  WLR Foods markets its products in
competition with larger and smaller poultry companies on the
basis of price, quality and service, with WLR Foods' greatest
competition coming from four or five of the country's larger
poultry producers and processors.  The pricing of poultry
products is so competitive that any company with a cost advantage
is in a favorable competitive position.  Seasonal increases in
production and customer buying patterns contribute to
fluctuations in prices which are controlled more by supply and
demand than by cost of production.  WLR Foods primarily markets
its products in the highly competitive northeastern section of
the United States.  

     In June 1994 WLR Foods was ranked as the ninth largest in
poultry processing/further processing according to Meat & Poultry
Magazine.  WLR Foods was the fourth largest American turkey
producer according to Turkey World magazine's December 1993
issue.  WLR Foods was cited as the 14th largest chicken producer
in the December 1993 issue of Broiler Industry magazine. 

<PAGE>
Seasonality 

     In general, WLR Foods consistently produces and sells its
products throughout the year.  Highest demand for poultry is in
May, June, July, November and December.  The early summer months
have strong demand for chicken and further processed products and
November and December are high demand months for turkey products. 
The highest demand for ice is during the period from mid-May to
mid-September.  

Trademarks and Patents

     Wampler-Longacre markets its products under the trademarks
WAMPLER LONGACRE and design, LONGACRE FAMILY and design, TRIM
FREE and chicken in heart design, MOUNTAIN MAID, SALADFEST, SALT
WATCHERS, TENDERLINGS and TURKEY WITH A TWIST, all of which are
federally registered trademarks.  Wampler-Longacre also markets
under the trademark CHEF'S QUALITY, which has a pending federal
application.  Wampler-Longacre markets its export and foreign
military sales under the ROCKINGHAM trademark.  Products are also
sold under the GENUINE SHENVALLEY VIRGINIA POULTRY mark. 

     Cassco distributes its products under the federally
registered trademark CASSCO.  

     Wampler-Longacre holds a patent for pasteurized salads.  

Government Contracts

     WLR Foods' government contracts are a small segment of its
total sales, consisting of bids on particular products for
delivery at specified locations.  Contracts are generally bid,
and the product is delivered, within a one- to two-month period. 
These contracts include both chicken and turkey products and can
involve further processed products.  WLR Foods had approximately 
$0.9 million of governmental contracts outstanding as of July 2,
1994, compared to approximately $1.8 million outstanding as of
July 3, 1993.

Foreign Sales 

     WLR Foods' foreign sales constituted approximately 7% of its
total annual sales in fiscal 1994, compared to 6% for fiscal year
1993 and 5% for fiscal year 1992.  Wampler-Longacre has a full-
time staffed foreign sales office which coordinates foreign sales
efforts on behalf of WLR Foods.  Foreign sales originate from
that office and use independent brokers as needed.  Sales are
made in over 40 countries.  

Transportation  

     Transportation logistics, including the availability of
transportation equipment and the efficiency of transportation
systems, are key elements in the raising of poultry, transporting
feed to the contract growers and outside purchasers, transporting
<PAGE>
poultry to the processing plants, and transporting products to
customers.  WLR Foods has contracts with two railroad companies
for the delivery of feed ingredients to WLR Foods' feedmills.

     WLR Foods' primary marketing area is the northeastern,
central and eastern United States, and delivery of the Company's
products are generally made by truck.  WLR Foods maintains a
fleet of refrigerated trucks and uses them, along with
refrigerated common carrier and customer-owned vehicles, to
deliver its product.  Export products are loaded in refrigerated
containers and shipped overseas.

Raw Materials

     WLR Foods' largest cost is for basic feed ingredients,
namely corn and soybean meal.  Feed costs represented
approximately 32% of the Company's total cost of sales in fiscal
year ended July 2, 1994.  

     Feed grains are commodities subject to volatile price
changes caused by weather, size of harvest, transportation and
storage cost and the agricultural policies of the United States
and foreign governments.  Although WLR Foods can, and sometimes
does, purchase grain in the forward markets, it cannot completely
eliminate the potential adverse effect of grain price increases. 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Compliance

     WLR Foods' facilities and operations are subject to the
regulatory jurisdiction of various federal agencies, including
the federal Food and Drug Administration, Department of
Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, and corresponding state agencies in
Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

     Wampler-Longacre currently holds two environmental permits
for its Hinton turkey processing facility:  an air permit which
regulates certain combustion equipment to comply with the Clean
Air Act and a water permit which regulates the treatment of
processing wastewater to comply with the Clean Water Act. 
Wampler-Longacre has one environmental permit for its
Harrisonburg turkey processing facility which requires it to pre-
treat its processing wastewater to meet certain effluent
standards before discharging it into the regional sewer. 
Wampler-Longacre currently has six environmental permits for its
Franconia turkey processing facility:  two water permits, issued
by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, for
the treatment of processing wastewater to comply with the Clean
Water Act, three air permits to regulate the operation of certain
combustion and incineration equipment, and one municipal waste
permit for the disposal of incinerator ash.  Wampler-Longacre's
turkey processing facility in New Oxford, Pennsylvania, holds one
environmental permit (air permit) which regulates combustion
equipment.  Wampler-Longacre also holds one environmental permit
(air permit) for its Harrisonburg feedmill issued primarily for
the control and abatement of dust.

<PAGE>

     Wampler-Longacre holds two permits for its Timberville
chicken processing and rendering facility:  a water permit to
regulate the discharge of processing wastewater and an air permit
to regulate the operation of its new protein conversion facility,
as well as certain combustion equipment.  Wampler-Longacre has
one permit for its Alma/Stanley chicken processing facility:  a
water permit to regulate the discharge of processing wastewater
to meet the standards of the Clean Water Act.  Additionally,
there are three permits for Wampler-Longacre's chicken processing
and rendering facility in Moorefield, West Virginia:  a water
permit to regulate the discharge of processing wastewater, an air
permit to regulate the operation of the company's new protein
conversion facility, and a sludge management permit regulating
the land application in West Virginia of certain wastewater
biosolids generated at the Moorefield wastewater treatment works. 
Finally, Wampler-Longacre holds one environmental permit (air
permit) for its Broadway and Moorefield feedmills which were
issued primarily for the control and abatement of dust.

     WLR Foods, on behalf of its Virginia chicken and turkey
processing facilities, filed for issuance of a Virginia Pollution
Abatement (VPA) permit regulating the land application in
Virginia of certain wastewater biosolids generated by the
facilities' Virginia wastewater treatment systems.  The VPA
permit will replace Wampler-Longacre's No-Discharge certificate
which formerly regulated the land application of the facilities'
wastewater sludges in Virginia and will supersede an Interim
Sludge Management Plan under which Wampler-Longacre has managed
certain wastewater biosolids generated from its Virginia
facilities.

     Management has taken steps to ensure that those facilities
regulated by new stormwater regulations have made the necessary
group, individual, or general permit applications in accordance
with the federal deadlines.

     Management believes that all facilities and operations are
currently in compliance with environmental and regulatory
standards.  Compliance has not had a materially adverse effect
upon WLR Foods' earnings or competitive position in the past, and
it is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the
future.

Employees

     WLR Foods employed approximately 6,800 persons as of July 2,
1994, none of whom were covered by a collective bargaining
agreement.


Item  2.  PROPERTIES.  

     WLR Foods' six poultry processing facilities and one further
processing plant are located in Virginia, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania and have a total slaughter capacity of approximately
460,000 turkeys per week and 3.1 million chickens per week.  WLR
Foods owns and operates three feed mills with a production
capacity in excess of one million tons of finished feed per year;
a turkey hatchery with a production capacity of approximately
335,000 poults per week and two chicken hatcheries with a 

<PAGE>

production capacity of approximately 3.2 million chicks per week;
freezer and cold storage for finished products with approximately
5.2 million cubic feet of capacity; and two protein conversion
plants with a total production capacity of 4,500 tons of raw
product weekly.  The diversity, number and geographic proximity
of its processing and support facilities provide WLR Foods with
operating flexibility and enable it to alter the size and mix of
poultry processed among the various facilities, as market
conditions change. 

     Cassco operates public refrigerated facilities at four
locations with approximately 7.0 million cubic feet.  These
facilities are located close to major food processors in the mid-
Atlantic region, as well as WLR Foods' own processing plants. 
Cassco also operates six ice manufacturing facilities in Virginia
and West Virginia with a capacity of approximately 1,000 tons per
day.  

     From fiscal 1988 through the end of fiscal 1994, WLR Foods
has spent over $152 million (excluding capital leases) for
replacement and productivity improvements, acquisitions and
expansion of facilities and protein conversion plant
construction.  WLR Foods owns virtually all of its manufacturing
and production equipment which is in good repair and is updated
periodically.  Replacement parts and service for the equipment
are readily available, which allows for timely processing of the
Company's products.

     On February 6, 1994, WLR Foods filed suit in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Virginia
against Tyson Foods, Inc. (Tyson), seeking, among other things,
(1) a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the Company's
Shareholder Protection Rights Plan, and (2) a declaratory
judgment as to the constitutionality of Article 14, Virginia Code
Sections 13.1-725 et seq. (Virginia Affiliated Transactions
Statute), and Article 14.1, Virginia Code Sections 13.1-728 et
seq. (Virginia Control Share Acquisitions Statute), of the
Virginia Stock Corporation Act under the Virginia and United
States Constitutions.

     In response, on February 25, 1994, Tyson, joined later by
its wholly-owned subsidiary WLR Acquisition
Corp., filed counterclaims against the Company
and all its directors, except Peter A.W. Green, seeking, among
other things, to invalidate the Company's Shareholder Protection
Rights Plan and certain severance agreements, and a declaratory
judgment that the Virginia Affiliated Transactions Statute, the
Virginia Control Share Acquisitions Statute and other Virginia
statutes, facially and as applied, are unconstitutional under the
United States Constitution.

     Tyson's counterclaims also sought a declaratory judgment
that four of the Company's directors who resigned as employees of
the Company in February 1994 were not disinterested shareholders,
and therefore were ineligible to vote their shares at a Special
Meeting of the Shareholders held on May 21, 1994, and that the
Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties in taking
certain actions described in Tyson's counterclaims.  Tyson filed
motions for preliminary relief as to the directors' eligibility
to vote and as to the constitutionality of the several Virginia
statutes, which motions for relief were denied by the District
Court on June 22, 1994 and August 7, 1994, respectively.

     Trial for any remaining issues was scheduled for September
12-15, 1994; however, those trial dates have been released.  The
District Court will issue a final judgment in the litigation
based on the written record, as supplemented.

Item  4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.  

     On March 9, 1994, Tyson Foods, Inc., through its wholly-
owned subsidiary, WLR Acquisition Corp., commenced a tender offer
to purchase all the outstanding shares of WLR Foods for $30 per
share.  The Board of Directors of WLR Foods determined that the
offer was inadequate and recommended that the Company's
shareholders not tender their shares to Tyson Foods, Inc.  This
position is detailed in the Company's Schedule 14d-9 filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 1994, as
amended.

     To further their takeover efforts, on April 14, 1994 Tyson
Foods, Inc. requested a special meeting of WLR Foods'
shareholders under the Virginia Control Share Acquisitions
Statute.

     A special meeting of the Company's shareholders was held on
May 21, 1994 for the sole purpose of considering a proposal of
Tyson to grant it and its associates voting rights for shares of
the Company's stock they have acquired or may acquire in
connection with their offer to buy the Company.

     On March 9, 1994, Tyson commenced an unsolicited public
tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the Company's
stock for $30 per share.  Among the conditions of Tyson's offer
was a requirement that it receive voting rights under Virginia's
Control Share Acquisitions Statute for all shares acquired by
Tyson and its affiliates.  Under the Control Share Statute, any
shares acquired in a control share acquisition or prior to a
control share acquisition and pursuant to a plan to make a
control share acquisition, have no voting rights unless voting
rights are granted by a resolution approved by a majority of
disinterested shares.  A control share acquisition is the direct
or indirect acquisition (other than certain excepted acquisitions
which are not relevant here) of shares of the Company that, when
added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiror,
would entitle the acquiror to vote 20% or more of the Company's
shares.

     At the May 21, 1994 special meeting, the Company's
shareholders defeated Tyson's proposal to grant it voting rights
for its control share acquisition.  At the meeting, 3,152,830
votes were cast in favor of Tyson's proposal, and 5,977,118 votes
were cast against the proposal.  There were 53,547 abstentions,
and 1,603,800 votes were either withheld or were broker non-
votes.

        Tyson Foods, Inc. terminated its tender offer on August 5,
1994.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES




The Board of Directors and Shareholders
WLR Foods, Inc.:

Under date of August 17, 1994, except Note 14 which is as of August 29, 1994, 
we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of 
WLR Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994 
and July 3, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
fiscal years in the three-year period ended July 2, 1994, as
contained in the 1994 annual report to stockholders.  These
consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are
incorporated by reference in the annual report on Form 10-K for
the year 1994.  In connection with our audits of the
aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also have
audited the related financial statement schedules as listed in
the accompanying index.  These financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statement schedules based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

entities of the same character as the Borrower consistently
applied, and all balance sheets and other financial statements
shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applicable to entities of the same
character as the Borrower consistently applied.


                            ARTICLE II

                         Representations

     Section 2.1.   Representations by Obligors.  Each Obligor
makes the following representations as the basis for its
undertakings hereunder:

          (a)  Such Obligor is a stock corporation duly organized
under the laws of Virginia and is in good standing therein, has
the power and authority to own its properties and to enter into
the Financing Instruments to which it is a party and the
transactions contemplated thereby and to perform its obligations
thereunder, and by proper corporate action has duly authorized
the execution and delivery of such Financing Instruments.  Such
Obligor is qualified to do business in each state in which it is
now doing business.

          (b)  Other than litigation with Tyson Foods, Inc. which
has previously been disclosed to the Banks, no litigation at law
or in equity or any proceeding before any governmental agency 
involving such Obligor is pending or, to the knowledge of such
Obligor, threatened in which any liability of such Obligor is not
adequately covered by insurance or in which any judgment or order
would have a material adverse effect upon the business or assets
of such Obligor or that would affect its authority to do
business, the validity of the Financing Instruments to which such
Obligor is a party or the performance of its obligations
thereunder.

          (c)  The execution and delivery of, and compliance by
such Obligor with the terms and conditions of, the Financing 
<PAGE>
Instruments to which it is a party will not constitute or result
in a default under or violation of (i) such Obligor's articles of
incorporation or bylaws, (ii) any agreement or other instrument
to which such Obligor is a party or by which it or its property
is bound, or (iii) any constitutional or statutory provision or
order, rule, regulation, decree or ordinance of any court,
government or governmental authority having jurisdiction over
such Obligor or its property.

          (d)  Such Obligor has obtained all consents, approvals,
authorizations and orders of any governmental or regulatory
authority that are required to be obtained by such Obligor as a
condition precedent to the issuance of the Note, the execution
and delivery of the Financing Instruments to which such Obligor
is a party, or the performance by such Obligor of its obligations
thereunder.

          (e)  No Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, and no event has occurred and is continuing which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event
of Default.

          (f)  All of the Financing Instruments to which such
Obligor is a party have been duly authorized by such Obligor and,
assuming due execution and delivery of the Financing Instruments
by the other parties thereto, are valid, enforceable and binding
obligations of such Obligor; provided that (i) the obligations of
such Obligor under such Financing Instruments are subject to
usual principles of equity and to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally, and (ii) the enforceability of the indemnity
provisions herein may be limited by applicable securities laws
and public policy.

                           ARTICLE III

                               Note

     Section 3.1.   Sale and Purchase of Note.  The Borrower
shall issue and sell the Note to the Banks.

     Each Bank represents that it is purchasing its Pro Rata
Share of the Note for its own account for investment and has no
present intention of reselling or disposing of such Pro Rata
Share or engaging in any "distribution" thereof (as that term is
used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder).  Each Bank represents that it is familiar with the
operations and financial condition of the Obligors based upon
information furnished to such Bank by the Obligors and has made
such inquiries as it deems appropriate in connection with the
purchase of such Pro Rata Share.

     No Bank shall assign or offer any portion of the Note, or
any participation therein, for sale in any state of the United
States without first (a) either (i) taking all necessary action
to qualify such portion for offer and sale under the securities
and "Blue Sky" laws of the United States and such state or (ii)
determining that no such action is necessary because of a 
<PAGE>
registration exemption or exemptions, and (b) providing to the
purchaser of such portion, or any participant therein, all
material information in such Bank's possession necessary to
evaluate the risks and merits of the investment represented by
the purchase of or participation in such portion.

     The Obligors represent that no Financing Instrument nor any
information (financial or otherwise) furnished by or on behalf of
the Obligors in connection with the negotiation or the sale of
the Note contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits (when considered together with all information furnished) a
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein,
in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.  There is no fact that the Obligors have not
disclosed in writing to each Bank that materially affects
adversely or, so far as the Obligors can now foresee, based on
facts known to them, will have a material adverse effect on the
properties, business, prospects, profits or condition (financial
or otherwise) of any Obligor or the ability of any Obligor to
perform its obligations under the Financing Instruments.

     Section 3.2.   Conditions Precedent to Delivery of Note. 
The Agent shall be required to accept delivery of the Note, on
behalf of the Banks, only upon delivery to it, in form and
substance satisfactory to it, of the following:

          (a)  Executed copies of the Financing Instruments.

          (b)  The certificates or policies of insurance required
by Section 8.3.

          (c)  Evidence of the due authorization, execution and
delivery of the Financing Instruments by the parties thereto.

          (d)  The Banks' commitment fee of $100,000, which shall
be shared Pro Rata by the Banks.

          (e)  Certified copies of (i) the resolutions of the
Obligors' boards of directors authorizing execution and delivery
of the Financing Instruments, (ii) the articles of incorporation
of each Obligor, and (iii) the bylaws of each Obligor.

          (f)  Evidence satisfactory to the Agent that no
Hazardous Substances (as defined in Section 6.8) are located on,
in or under the Land.

          (g)  An opinion of counsel for the Obligors.

          (h)  Such other documentation, certificates and
opinions as may be reasonably required by the Agent or any Bank.

                            ARTICLE IV

                               Loan

     Section 4.1.   Pro Rata Shares.  the Pro Rata Share for each
Bank shall be as follows:  (a) for FUNB, 40%, (b) for CBNA, 40%,
and (c) for Crestar, 20%.

     Section 4.2.   Loan.  The Banks shall make the Loan by
making Advances to the Borrower in such amounts as may be
requested from time to time by an Authorized Representative in a
Request for Borrowing; provided that the aggregate amount of
Advances made under the Loan shall not exceed the maximum
principal amount of the Note; and provided further that no
Advance shall be in an amount of less than $1,000,000.  Each
Request for Borrowing shall be in the form of Exhibit 1 hereto
and shall be delivered to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on
the Business Day preceding the Business Day on which the Advance
requested thereby is to be made.

     Section 4.3.   Advances.  An Advance shall be made by one or
more checks or wire transfers paid to such person as may be
specified in the applicable Request for Borrowing.  Each Bank
shall pay, or cause the Agent to pay on its behalf, its Pro Rata
Share of each Advance.  No Bank shall be required to pay, as its
portion of the Advances, an aggregate amount exceeding its Pro
Rata share of the maximum principal amount of the Note.

     The Banks shall be not required to make any requested
Advance until the Agent shall have received all of the items
specified in Section 3.2, even if the Agent shall have accepted
delivery of the Note, or the Banks shall have made any earlier
Advance, without having received all of such items.  The Banks
also shall not be required to make any requested Advance at any
time that an event has occurred and is continuing which
constitutes or, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute an Event of Default.

     No Advance shall be made more than three months after the
Closing Date or after the date on which the Note is payable in
full.

     Section 4.4.   Payment of Temporary Notes.  So long as any
principal of the Temporary Notes remains unpaid, the Borrower
shall apply the amount of each Advance to the payment of such
principal, and the Agent may cause any Advance to be so applied
rather than paying the amount thereof to the person indicated in
the applicable Request for Borrowing.  If the principal of the
Temporary Notes shall not have been paid in full before July 24,
1994, an Authorized Representative shall be deemed to have
submitted a Request for Borrowing for an Advance to be made on
such date in an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance
of the Temporary Notes, and the Agent shall cause the amount of
such Advance to be applied to the payment of such principal
balance.

                            ARTICLE V

                             Payments

     Section 5.1.   Amounts Payable.  (a)  The Borrower shall
make all payments required under the Note, as and when the same
become due (whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),
in the manner set forth in the Note and shall make all other
Required Payments in the manner set forth in the applicable
Financing Instruments.  Payments to the Agent shall be made in
lawful money of the United States of America at the address of
the Agent set forth in Section 11.7 or at such other place as the
Agent may direct in writing.  Any amount at any time paid to the
Agent as a payment of principal of or interest on the Note as the
same become due shall be credited against the Borrower's
obligations hereunder as of the date such obligations are due
(but subject to collection of any instrument, draft, check or
order for payment received by the Agent).

          (b)  The Borrower shall pay (i) the reasonable fees and
expenses of the Banks, the Agent and counsel to the Banks and the
Agent and all other costs, fees and expenses incidental to the
financing hereunder, the issuance of the Note and the costs of
producing the Financing Instruments, (ii) all taxes of any kind
whatsoever lawfully assessed, levied or imposed with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) all
costs of collection (including reasonable counsel fees) in the
event of a default in the payment of the principal of or interest
on the Note or other charges payable under this Agreement.  The
obligations of the Borrower under this subsection shall survive
Payment of the Note.

     Section 5.2.   Default in Payments.  If the Borrower should
fail to make any Required Payment of principal of and/or interest
on the Note by the date which is seven days after the due date
for such Required Payment, the Borrower shall pay the Banks, on a
Pro Rata basis, a late charge in an amount equal to the lesser of
(a) 5% of the amount of such Required Payment or (b) $1,200.  If
the Borrower should fail to make any other Required Payment when
due, the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay
interest thereon at the Prime Rate plus 0.5%.

     Section 5.3.   Unconditional Obligations.  The obligations
of the Obligors to make Required Payments and to perform and
observe all other covenants, conditions and agreements hereunder
shall be general obligations of the Obligors and shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any defense or any
rights of setoff, recoupment or counterclaim any Obligor might
otherwise have against the Agent or any Bank.  Nothing in this
section shall be construed as a waiver by the Obligors of any
rights or claims any of them may have against the Agent or any
Bank under this Agreement or otherwise, but any recovery upon
such rights and claims shall be had from the Agent or such Bank,
as the case may be, separately.  Subject to Section 10.1, the
Obligors shall not suspend or discontinue any such payment
hereunder or fail to observe and perform any of their other
covenants, conditions and agreements under the Financing
Instruments for any cause, including without limitation any acts
or circumstances that may constitute failure of consideration, or
commercial frustration of purpose, or any change in the tax or 
<PAGE>
other laws of the United States of America, the Commonwealth of
Virginia or any political subdivision of either, or any failure
of the Agent or the Banks to observe and perform any covenant,
condition or agreement, whether express or implied, or any duty,
liability or obligation contained in or arising out of or in
connection with any Financing Instrument.

                            ARTICLE VI

                        Special Covenants

     Section 6.1.   Insurance.  The Obligors shall continuously
maintain, or cause to be maintained, insurance against such risks
as are customarily insured against by  businesses or owners of
like size and character, paying as the same become due all
premiums in respect thereto, including without limitation:

          (a)  Insurance to the extent of $1,000,000 single limit
against liability for bodily injury, including death resulting
therefrom, and damage to property, including loss of use thereof,
arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of any of the
Obligors' properties.

          (b)  Workers' compensation insurance with respect to
all employees of each Obligor, unless such Obligor qualifies as a
self-insurer under the laws of each state in which it has
employees.

          (c)  Such other insurance as the Agent or any Bank may
reasonably require.

     All such insurance shall be taken out and maintained with
generally recognized responsible insurance companies qualified to
do business in the applicable states and having ratings from A.
M. Best & Co. of A or higher, which insurance companies are
selected by the Borrower and acceptable to the Agent and may be
written with deductible amounts comparable to those on similar
policies carried by other businesses of like size and character. 
All such policies shall be deposited with the Agent; provided
that in lieu of such policies there may be delivered to the Agent
a certificate or certificates of the respective insurers
attesting the fact that the required insurance is in force and
effect.  Prior to the expiration of any such policy the Borrower
shall furnish the Agent evidence satisfactory to the Agent that
the policy has been renewed or replaced or is no longer required
by this Agreement.

     In lieu of separate policies the Obligors may maintain
blanket or umbrella policies if such policies provide the same
coverage required above with protection against each risk not
reducible by claims for other risks to amounts less than that
specified above and the Borrower deposits with the Agent a
certificate or certificates of the respective insurers evidencing
such coverage.

     Each policy required by this section shall contain an
undertaking by the insurer (if such shall be available at
reasonable cost) that such policy shall not be modified adversely
to the interests of the Banks or canceled without at least 30
days' prior written notice to the Agent.
<PAGE>
     Section 6.2.   Cure by Banks.  If any obligor shall fail to
make any payment or perform any act required of it hereunder, the
Agent or any Bank, without prior notice to or demand upon the
Obligors and without releasing any obligation or waiving any
default, may (but shall be under no obligation to) make such
payment or perform such act.  All amounts so paid by the Agent or
any Bank and all costs, fees and expenses so incurred, including
reasonable counsel fees, shall be immediately due and payable by
the Borrower as an additional obligation under this Agreement,
together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate plus 0.5%, to
the extent permitted by law.

     Section 6.3.   Indemnification.  (a)  The Borrower shall
protect, indemnify and save harmless the Banks, the Agent and any
persons who "controls" (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Section 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) any Bank or the
Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against
all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes
of action, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees and expenses and settlement amounts) imposed upon
or incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Party on
account of or related to (i) any failure of the Obligors to
comply with any of the terms, warranties, covenants or
representations in the Financing Instruments, or (ii) any loss or
damage to property or any injury to or death of any person that
may be occasioned by any cause whatsoever pertaining to any
property of the Obligors or the use thereof; provided that such
indemnity shall be effective only to the extent of any loss that
may be sustained by an Indemnified Party in excess of the
proceeds received by it from any insurance carried with respect
to such loss and provided further that benefits of this section
shall not inure to any person other than the Indemnified 
Parties.  Nothing contained herein shall require the Borrower to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for any claim or liability
resulting from its negligence or willful, wrongful acts.

     (b)  The Borrower shall also indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Parties against any and all losses, claims, damages,
or liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in information submitted
by any Obligor to any  Bank with respect to the issuance and
purchase of the Note or caused by any omission or alleged
omission of any material fact necessary to be stated therein in
order to make such statements to such Bank not misleading or
incomplete.  

     (c)  If any action is brought against any Indemnified Party
in respect of which indemnity may be sought from the Borrower
under subsection (a) or (b) above, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Borrower in writing, and the Borrower shall
assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel,
the payment of all expenses and the right to negotiate and
consent to settlement.  Each Indemnified Party has the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in
the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
will be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless the
employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by 
<PAGE>
the Borrower.  The Borrower will not be liable for any settlement
of any such action made without its consent, but if such action
is settled with the consent of the Borrower or if there be a
final judgment for the plaintiff in such action, the Borrower
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from
and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment. 

     (d)  The obligations of the Borrower under this section
shall survive Payment of the Note.  All references in this
section to any Indemnified Party shall include its directors,
officers, employees and agents. 

     Section 6.4.   Certificate as to No Default.  The Borrower
shall deliver to the Agent concurrently with the delivery of each
of the audited financial statements of the Borrower provided for
in Section 6.6 a certificate signed by the president, a vice
president or the treasurer of the Borrower stating that, during
the period covered by such financial statements and as of the
date of such certificate, no event or condition has occurred or
existed, or is occurring or existing, that constitutes or that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event
of Default, or if such an event or condition has occurred or
existed, or is occurring or existing, specifying the nature and
period of such event or condition and what action the Obligors
have taken, are taking or propose to take with respect thereto. 
Each Obligor shall promptly notify the Agent at any time such
Obligor becomes aware of any event or condition described in the
preceding sentence. 

     Section 6.5.   References to Note Ineffective after Note
Paid.  Upon Payment of the Note, all references in this Agreement
to the Note shall be ineffective, and the Agent and the Banks
shall thereafter have no rights hereunder, except as explicitly
provided herein. 

     Section 6.6.   Financial Records and Statements.  The
Obligors shall maintain proper books of record and account, in
which full and correct entries shall be made, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applicable to entities
of the same character as the Obligors, of all their business and
affairs.  Each Obligor, within 120 days after the end of each of
its fiscal years, shall furnish the Agent copies of the balance
sheet of such Obligor as of the end of such fiscal year and
statement of income of such Obligor for such fiscal year, all in
reasonable detail and including supporting schedules.  All
financial statements referred to in the preceding sentence shall
be accompanied by an unqualified opinion, or other opinion
satisfactory to the Agent, with respect thereto rendered by
independent certified public accountants.  Each Obligor, within
60 days after the end of each quarter of each of its fiscal
years, shall furnish the Agent copies of the unaudited balance
sheet of such Obligor as of the end of such quarter and unaudited
statement of income of such Obligor for such quarter, all in
reasonable detail and including supporting schedules.  All
financial statements referred to in the preceding sentence shall
be certified by such Obligor.  Each Obligor shall furnish the
Agent such additional unaudited financial statements of such
Obligor as the Agent may reasonably request.  Any financial
statements of any Obligor required by this section may be
prepared on a consolidated basis so long as the parent
corporation for the consolidated corporations to which such
statements relate is an Obligor and all subsidiaries reflected
therein are wholly-owned subsidiaries or Restricted Subsidiaries.

<PAGE>
     Section 6.7.   Notice of Suits.  The Obligors shall notify
the Agent as soon as any obligor has knowledge thereof of any
actions, suits or proceedings at law, in equity or before or by
any governmental authority, pending or threatened, involving the
validity or enforceability of any of the Financing Instruments or
which involves an alleged or potential liability of any Obligor
exceeding $5,000,000.  

     Section 6.8.   Environmental Matters.  (a)  The Borrower
warrants and represents that (i) the Land is now and at all times
will be in full compliance with all federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, including, without
limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act and the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986, (ii) to the best knowledge of the
Borrower, as of the date hereof there are no hazardous materials,
substances or wastes or other environmentally regulated
substances, including, without limitation, any materials

legally authorized to maintain in, on or under the Land or use in
connection therewith, and (B) the existence, extent and nature of

other material governmental or other communication with respect
to any Hazardous Substances regarding the Land, nor, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, has any such citation, order, notice
or other communication been received by any previous owner or
operator of the Land. 

     (b)  The Borrower shall promptly notify the Agent of any
change in the existence, extent or nature of any Hazardous
Substances located on, in or under the Land or used in connection
therewith.  The Borrower shall promptly (i) transmit to the Agent
copies of any citations, orders, notices or other material
governmental or other communications received by the Borrower
with respect to any Hazardous Substances, and (ii) advise the
Agent of any enforcement actions taken by local, state or federal
governmental agencies, or claims by other parties, relating to
any Hazardous Substances affecting the Land. 

     (c)  The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Bank
and hold them harmless from and against any and all damages,
penalties, fines, claims, liens, suits, liabilities, costs
(including cleanup costs), judgments and expenses (including
attorneys', consultants' or experts' fees and expenses) of every
kind and nature suffered by or asserted against the Agent or any
Bank as a direct or indirect result of (i) any representation set
forth in this section being incorrect in any material respect,
(ii) the breach of any warranty or covenant set forth in this
section, (iii) any federal, state or local law, regulation or
ordinance which requires the elimination or removal of any
Hazardous Substances which are at any time located on, in or
under the Land or used in connection therewith, including any
elimination or removal required of any person owning or
possessing any part of the Land after ownership or possession
thereof by the Agent or any Bank, other than the elimination or
removal of Hazardous Substances which are (A) first located on,
in or under the Land or used in connection therewith after the
last date on which the Borrower owned or possessed any part of
the Land, or (B) placed on, in or under the Land by the party
seeking indemnification. 
<PAGE>
     (d)  The provisions of this section shall survive Payment of
the Note. 

     Section 6.9.   Consolidated Adjusted Net Worth.  The
Borrower will at all times keep and maintain a Consolidated
Adjusted Net Worth which is not less than $90,000 and not less
than 45% of the total assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.  

     Section 6.10.  Fixed Charge  Coverage Ratio.  The Borrower
shall maintain, as of the last day of each quarter of each of its
fiscal years, a ratio of (1) Consolidated Pre-Tax Income of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the period of 24
consecutive months ending as of the date of calculation to (b)
Fixed Charges of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for
such 24-month period of not less than 1.25 to 1.00.  

     Section 6.11.  Funded Debt.  The Borrower shall not permit
its Consolidated Funded debt outstanding at any time to exceed
40% of its Consolidated Adjusted Capital at such time.  For
purposes of this section, there shall not be included as Funded
Debt any Short-Term Debt if, during any period of twelve
consecutive calendar months immediately preceding the date of
determination, there is a period of at least 30 consecutive days
during which Short-Term Debt does not exceed $10,000,000;
provided that, if no such period exists, the amount by which the
lowest average daily principal amount of outstanding Short-Term
Debt exceeds $10,000,000 shall be included as Funded Debt. 

     Section 6.12.  Limitations on Liens.  The Borrower will not,
and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or
incur, or suffer to be incurred or to exist, any Lien on the
property or assets of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or upon any income or
profits therefrom, or transfer any property for the purpose of
subjecting the same to the payment of obligations in priority to
the payment of the general creditors of the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or acquire or agree to acquire, or permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to acquire, any property or assets upon
conditional sales agreements or other title retention devices,

          (a)  Liens for property taxes and assessments or
     governmental charges or levies, not yet due and
     payable. 

          (b)  Liens of or resulting from any judgment or
     award, the time for the appeal or petition for
     rehearing of which shall not have expired, or in
     respect of which the Borrower or a Restricted
     Subsidiary shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal
     or proceeding for a review and in respect of which a
     stay of execution pending such appeal or proceeding for
     review shall have been secured. 
<PAGE>
          (c)  Any mechanic's, materialmen's,
     warehousemen's, supplier's or vendor's lien or right in
     respect thereof, any deposits or Liens to secure
     statutory obligations or surety bonds or other Liens of
     like general nature incurred in the ordinary course of
     business and not in connection with the borrowing of
     money, but only if in each case the obligation secured
     is not overdue or, if overdue, is being contested in
     good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings that
     will prevent a forfeiture or sale of any property and
     an adequate book reserve shall have been set aside with
     respect thereto. 

          (d)  Minor exceptions in the nature of easements,
     rights of others for rights-of-way, utilities and other
     similar purposes, or zoning or other restrictions as to

     impair their use or value in the operation of the
     business of the Borrower and its Restricted
     Subsidiaries.  

          (e)  Liens existing as of the date hereof which
     secure Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Restricted

     the Borrower) and (iii) such Lien is incurred with
     respect to such property at the time of, or within

     shall be the surviving or continuing corporation and,
     in any merger or consolidation involving a Wholly-Owned
     Restricted Subsidiary (but not the Borrower), such
     Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary shall be the
     surviving or continuing corporation.  

          (ii) The Borrower may consolidate or merge with
     any other corporation if (A) the surviving or
     continuing corporation shall be a corporation organized

     giving effect thereto, no Event of Default, nor any
     other event or condition which, with the giving of

     an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be
     continuing.

     such consolidation or merger and after giving effect
     thereto, no Event of Default, nor any other event or

     shall have occurred and be continuing, and (C) after
     giving effect to such consolidation or merger, the
     Borrower could still incur additional liens by reason
     of Section 6.12(h).  

          (iv) Any Restricted Subsidiary may sell, lease or
     otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
     assets to the Borrower or any Wholly-Owned Restricted
     Subsidiary.

to issue or sell any shares of stock of any class (including as

declaration.  Any dividend which complies with the provisions of
this section on the date of its declaration shall be deemed to

which is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary shall remain a
Restricted Subsidiary for all purposes of this Agreement unless

have no continuing investment, whether in the nature of capital
stock, Indebtedness or otherwise, in the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary.

                              Agency

     Section 7.1.   Appointment of Agent.  Each Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action
as agent on behalf of such Bank and to exercise such powers under
the Financing Instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms thereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The duties of the
Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature, and the
Agent shall not by reason of this Agreement be a trustee or
fiduciary for any Bank.  The Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth under the
Financing Instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement.  As to any
matters not expressly provided for by the Financing Instruments
or the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agent may act or refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining
from acting) upon the instructions of the Banks, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Banks; provided that the
Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the
Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to the Financing
Instruments or the Intercreditor Agreement or applicable law. 
The Agent may resign and be replaced as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement.  The Banks, or the successor Agent on
their behalf, shall promptly give the Borrower notice of any such
resignation or replacement.  The Agent shall not be required to
take any action hereunder or under the Intercreditor Agreement,
other than any required distribution of moneys to the Banks,
until it is indemnified by the Banks to its satisfaction against
any costs or liability which it might incur by reason of so
acting.

     Section 8.1.   Guaranty of Obligations.  The Guarantors
hereby jointly and severally guarantee to the Agent, for the
benefit of the Banks, the prompt payment, when due, of all
obligations of the Borrower under the Financing Instruments (the
"Obligations") and agree that upon default by the Borrower in the
payment when due of any Obligation, the Guarantors will promptly
pay the same.  The guaranty obligation of the Guarantors
contained in this section shall be a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guaranty.  The foregoing is a guaranty of payment,
and not of collection.  

     Section 8.2.   Waivers.  (a)  The Guarantors hereby waive
notice of the creation, incurrence or extension of any
Obligations now existing or hereafter arising. 

     (b)  The Guarantors hereby waive protest, all demands and
all notices including, but not limited to, any notices in
connection with, related to or associated with, whether by law or
agreement, (i) the failure (whether partial or otherwise) by the
Borrower or by any other person to timely, properly or otherwise
pay or perform any Obligation or (ii) the creation, preservation,
perfection or enforcement or lack thereof, or any failure by any
person in respect thereof, regarding any Security.  

     Section 8.3.   Forbearance and Modifications.  The
Guarantors hereby agree that, without further notice or consent,
the same hereby being waived, and without affecting the
Guarantors' liabilities hereunder, the Agent or any Bank may at
any time, in the exercise of its sole discretion, take or refrain
from taking any lawful action, including without limitation
changing any terms of all or any part of any Obligations,
granting any extensions, modifications or renewals of any
Obligations, effecting any releases, compromises or settlements
or making any other indulgences with respect to any Obligations,
entering into any agreement concerning the use of any or all of
the Security or changing the terms of any agreement concerning
any or all of the Security, consenting to the substitution,
exchange or release of all or any part of the Security or any
person liable to the Agent or any Bank with respect thereto,
realizing upon all or any part of the Security in any lawful
manner, or forbearing from realizing upon all or any part of the
Security.  

     Section 8.4.   Continuing Liability.  (a)  The Guarantors
shall not be released from any obligations or liability under and
shall not have any rights or recourse against the Agent or any
Bank, for any reason relating to (i) any default with respect to
any Security existing when the Security is accepted by the Agent
or any Bank or at any time thereafter, (ii) any failure to
convey, create or perfect a valid Lien in any Security, (iii) any
invalidity or defect in any Security, (iv) the existence of any
equities, defenses or claims in favor of others with respect to
any Security, (v) failure to correctly estimate the value of any
Security or the change in value of any Security, (vi) any
deterioration, waste or loss to any Security, and/or (vii) any
rights and consents granted, waivers made or other actions taken
or not taken by the Agent or any Bank under Section 8.2(b).  THE
GUARANTORS HEREBY WAIVE ALL SURETYSHIP AND OTHER SIMILAR
DEFENSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE
AGENT OR ANY BANK TO PROCEED TO ENFORCE THE OBLIGATIONS AGAINST
ANY PERSON BEFORE OR CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS GUARANTY.  
<PAGE>
     (b)  The Guarantors' obligations and liabilities under the
Guaranty shall not be in any way affected or terminated if any
other person liable, primarily or secondarily, directly or
indirectly, for all or any part of any Obligations shall cease to
exist, dissolve, wind up its business, suspend business, make any
assignment for the benefit of creditors generally, become
insolvent or admit in writing its insolvency, generally not pay
its debts as they become due, or become a debtor in a bankruptcy
case or if a receiver, trustee or custodian is appointed for such
other person's property or is authorized to take charge of any of
its property to enforce a Lien against it or for purposes of
general administration for the benefit of its creditors, or if
such other person should petition or apply to any tribunal for
any receiver for or any trustee of it or its estate or for relief
under any bankruptcy, arrangement, reorganization, readjustment
of debt, receivership, dissolution or liquidation proceedings or
under any law relating to the relief of debtors, or have any such
action commenced against it, with or without its consent. 

     Section 8.5.   Subrogation.  The Guarantors hereby waive any
right of subrogation with respect to the Obligations or any
Security and agree not to enter into any agreement with the
Borrower which grants to either of the Guarantors any right
waived hereby or any right to recover from the Borrower any
amount paid by either Guarantor hereunder. 

     Section 8.6.   Subordination.  The Guarantors hereby (a)
subordinate to the Obligations any present and future debts,
obligations or liabilities, whether contingent or otherwise, of
the Borrower to any Guarantor, alone or with any other person,
(b) subordinate any Liens, whether now existing or hereafter
arising, securing payment of such debts, obligations or
liabilities, and (c) agree that no Guarantor shall ask for,
demand, sue for, take or receive any part of such debts,
obligations and liabilities while payment of any of the
Obligations is in default.  If any payment is made to any
Guarantor on account of such debts, obligations or liabilities in
violation of the terms hereof, such Guarantor shall forthwith pay
all such amounts to the Agent to be credited and applied, in the
Agent's sole discretion (but Pro Rata), to the Obligations then
outstanding, whether matured or unmatured, contingent or
otherwise.  

     Section 8.7.   Further Guaranties.  Any subsequent guaranty
to or for the benefit of Agent or any Bank by any person,
including any Guarantor, shall not supersede or terminate the
Guaranty, but shall be an additional guaranty unless otherwise
stated therein.  If any Guarantor has given a previous guaranty
to the Agent or any Bank, the Guaranty shall be in addition to
such previous guaranty.

expiration) specifying such failure and requesting that it be
remedied, given by the Agent to the Borrower, or in the case of
any such default that can be cured but cannot with due diligence
be cured within such 30-day period, failure of such Obligor to
proceed promptly to cure the same and thereafter prosecute the
curing of the same with due diligence. 

     (c)  (i)  Failure of any Obligor to pay generally its debts
as they become due, (ii) commencement by any Obligor of a
voluntary case under the federal bankruptcy laws, as now or

any warranty, representation or other statement by or on behalf

with the issuance or sale of the Note was false or misleading in
any material respect at the time it was made or delivered. 

     (g)  The acceleration of any indebtedness of any Obligor to
any person, in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or more, by

     Section 9.2.   Remedies on Default.  Upon the occurrence and
continuation of an Event of Default, the Agent may:

     (a)  Declare all payments hereunder and under the Note to be
due and payable on a date which is not earlier than 30 days after
notice of such declaration is given to the Borrower by the Agent,
whereupon the same shall become due and payable on such date.  

     (b)  Take whatever action at law or in equity may appear
necessary or desirable to collect the amounts then due and

enforce observance or performance of any covenant, condition or

     The Agent shall give notice to the Borrower of the exercise
of any of the rights or remedies under this section (i) in
writing in the manner provided in Section 11.7 and (ii) by
telephone or telegram, provided that failure to give such notice
by telephone or telegram shall not affect the validity of the
exercise of any right or remedy under this section. 

     Any balance of the moneys collected pursuant to action taken
under this section remaining after payment of all costs and
expenses of collection and amounts due hereunder shall be paid to
the Banks and applied Pro Rata toward the making of Required
Payments then due and payable, provided that after Payment of the
Note and payment of all other sums required by applicable law any
such balance shall be paid to the Borrower.

cumulative and in addition to every other remedy herein or now or
hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute.  No delay or
failure to exercise any right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be
construed to be a waiver thereof, and any such right or power may
be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed
expedient. 

     Section 9.4.   Counsel Fees and Other Expenses.  The
Borrower shall on demand pay to the Agent the reasonable counsel

     Section 10.1.  Option to Prepay.  The Note may be prepaid at
the option of the Borrower according to its terms and subject to
any requirements contained therein.  Such prepayment of the Note
shall be deemed prepayment of the Borrower's obligations
hereunder in the same amount.  Prepayment of the Note in full
shall discharge the Borrower from its obligations under this
Agreement and the Note (other than obligations which survive
Payment of the Note), but only if such prepayment shall
constitute Payment of the Note.  

     Section 10.2.  Mandatory Prepayment.  If the Banks shall
determine that, due to one or more changes in ownership or voting
of the stock of the Borrower and/or one or more other changes
relating to such stock, effective control of the Borrower is
possessed by one or more stockholders who do not now possess such
effective control, the Banks may elect that the Note be prepaid
in full.  The Borrower shall prepay the Note in full within 180
days after receiving notice of such election from the Banks or
from the Agent on behalf of the Banks. 

                            ARTICLE XI

                          Miscellaneous

     Section 11.1.  Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall be
effective upon execution and delivery hereof.  Subject to earlier
satisfaction upon prepayment of all of the Borrower's obligations
hereunder pursuant to Section 10.1 and the making in full of all
other Required Payments due and payable at the date of such
prepayment and subject to any provisions hereof which survive
Payment of the Note, the Obligors' obligations hereunder shall
expire on the date provided in the Note for the final payment of
principal thereon, or if all Required Payments have not been made
on such date, when all Required Payments have been made. 

     Section 11.2.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 
No assignment by any Obligor shall relieve such Obligor of its
obligations hereunder. 

     Section 11.3.  Jurisdiction and Venue.  Any judicial
proceeding to enforce performance of any obligation of any
Obligor under the Financing Instruments may be brought before any
court of competent jurisdiction located in the City of
Harrisonburg, Virginia or in the United Stated District Court for
the Western District of Virginia.  If any such proceeding is
brought before any such court, no Obligor shall assert any
defense relating to the jurisdiction of such court or the venue
of such proceedings.  The Obligors agree that service of process
with respect to any such proceeding may be made upon any employee
or officer of any Obligor who may be located in the Commonwealth
of Virginia at the time of such service and that  any such
service shall be deemed to be valid service upon any Obligor
named as a party in such proceeding. 

     Section 11.4.  Severability.  If any provision of this
Agreement shall be held invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such holding shall not invalidate any other
provision hereof. 

     Section 11.5.  Applicable Law; Entire Understanding.  This
Agreement shall be governed by the applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.  The Financing Instruments express the
entire understanding and all agreements between the parties and
may not be modified except in a writing signed by the parties.

Note without the consent of the Banks.

                         PROMISSORY NOTE

                         WLR FOODS, INC.

$25,000,000 Maximum                               July 20, 1994

     WLR Foods, Inc. (the "Borrower"), for value received, hereby
promises to pay to First Union National Bank of Virginia,
Corestates Bank, N.A., also doing business as Philadelphia
National Bank, and Crestar Bank (collectively, the "Banks"), or
assigns, in lawful money of the United States of America, a
principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of Advances, as
defined in and made under the Agreement (as hereinafter defined),
but not to exceed $25,000,000.00, together with interest hereon
from the date hereof until payment and, to the extent permitted
by law, interest on any overdue installments of such interest, at
a per annum rate of interest equal to LIBOR (as hereinafter
defined), plus 1.0%.  Interest hereon shall be calculated on the
basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days
elapsed. 

     Interest on the unpaid principal hereof shall be payable on
the first day of each month, beginning on the first day of the
month following the month in which occurs the date of this Note. 
Principal of this Note shall be payable in installments of
$308,641.00 the first day of each month, beginning on November 1,
1994.  If not sooner paid, the entire remaining principal balance
hereof shall be due and payable on July 1, 2001, together with
all interest then accrued. 

     If any principal payment hereon provided for above shall
exceed the outstanding principal balance hereof at the date such
payment is scheduled to be made, the amount of such payment shall
be reduced to the amount of such outstanding principal balance. 
The amount by which such payment is reduced pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be added to the amount of the next
principal payment due hereon, but such next principal payment (as
so increased) shall be subject to the provisions of the preceding
sentence.  In no event shall the aggregate principal payments
required to be made hereon exceed the aggregate amount of
Advances. 

     As used in this Note, "LIBOR", as in effect on any day,
shall mean the London Interbank Offered Rates for one-month
deposits as shown in The Wall Street Journal on such day or, if
not so shown on such day, as most recently shown in The Wall
Street Journal.  If the London Interbank Offered Rates should
cease to be shown in The Wall Street Journal, LIBOR shall
thereafter be determined on the basis of the London Interbank
Offered Rates as shown in such comparable source as the Agent (as
defined in the Agreement) may select.  For purposes of
calculating interest on this Note, LIBOR as in effect on the<PAGE>
first day of a month shall be deemed to be in effect for the
entirety of such month.  

     All payments of principal of and interest on this Note shall
be made to the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, in
immediately available funds, at the principal office of the Agent
in Harrisonburg, Virginia, or at such other place as the Agent
may in writing designate. 

<PAGE>

     This Note is subject to prepayment on the first day of any
month, in whole or in part, upon 30 days' prior written notice,
by payment of the outstanding principal amount hereof to be
prepaid. 

     This Note is issued pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated as of
June 1, 1994 among the Banks, the Borrower, Wampler-Longacre,
Inc. and Cassco Ice & Cold Storage, Inc. (the "Agreement") to
evidence the Borrower's obligation to repay the Loan (as defined
in the Agreement) and is entitled to the benefits and subject to
the conditions thereof, including the provisions of Section 5.3
thereof that the Borrower's obligations thereunder and hereunder
shall be unconditional.  All of the terms, conditions and
provisions of the Agreement are, by this reference thereto,
incorporated herein as a part of this Note. 

     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Agreement)
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on
this Note may be declared immediately due and payable as provided
in the Agreement. 

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower has caused this Note to be
executed in its name as of the date first above written. 

                              WLR FOODS, INC.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
WLR Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries

General Information

WLR Foods, Inc. again posted record sales during its fiscal year
ended July 2, 1994.  Net earnings increased 13.3% to $16.6
million, raising net earnings to $1.51 per share.  Several
factors contributed to this success.  The Company consolidated
its chicken and turkey subsidiaries into one subsidiary,
Wampler-Longacre, Inc., and streamlined its management group to
take advantage of the strengths of each of its operating units. 
Pounds sold increased 15.3% in fiscal 1994, reflecting the
completed expansion of the Moorefield, West Virginia chicken
processing complex, which achieved projected production levels in
January 1994.  A full year of production at the New Oxford,
Pennsylvania turkey facility, acquired by WLR Foods in fiscal
1993, also helped boost sales volumes.  Cassco Ice & Cold
Storage, Inc. expanded its operations with a $4.4 million
refrigerated warehouse in Harrisonburg and increased ice
production tonnage 20% by adding capacity at its Norfolk
facility. The warehouse became operational in mid-September 1994
while the ice expansion was completed in time to meet the
summer's seasonal high ice business.   WLR Foods continues to
concentrate on the production and marketing of value-added
product lines which generate higher, more consistent profit
margins to insulate WLR Foods against cyclical industry swings.

WLR Foods experienced a challenging year in fiscal 1994 when, in
January 1994, Tyson Foods commenced a hostile takeover attempt of
the company.  The offer was repeatedly rejected by the Board of
Directors and the shareholders of WLR Foods, and on August 5,
1994, Tyson Foods terminated its tender offer.  WLR Foods spent
$3.1 million on its hostile takeover defense in fiscal 1994.

On August 29, 1994, the Company acquired Cuddy Farms, Inc.- USA
Food Division for $43.0 million in cash and 1,183,333 shares of 
common stock. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase, 
with the operations being absorbed into Wampler-Longacre, Inc. 
The cash was provided by a draw on the line of credit and the seven 
year loan provided by the banks.  It is now estimated the purchase 
price will be less than $73.8 million as originally reported.  No 
additional shares will be issued.  If the purchase price is less than 
$71.4 million, Cuddy will pay WLR Foods the difference in cash.

WLR Foods adopted SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" in
fiscal 1994.  The Company used the prospective method of adoption
of the statement.  There was no cumulative effect adjustment
necessary on the consolidated statement of earnings as a result
of the adoption of the new statement.  The consolidated balance
sheet as of July 2, 1994 reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 109.  

WLR Foods will adopt SFAS No. 112 "Employers Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," and SFAS No. 115 "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt Securities," in fiscal 1995. SFAS No.
116 "Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions
Made," will be adopted by the end of fiscal 1996. Management
<PAGE>
believes there will not be a material impact on WLR Foods
financial statements as a result of the adoption of any or all of
these statements.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 1994 net sales were $727.3 million, up 17.9% from $616.7 
million in fiscal 1993.  Sales pounds increased 15.3% over fiscal
1993 levels. Chicken sales pounds were up 14.3% due to bringing
the expanded Moorefield chicken complex production to full
capacity.  The New Oxford turkey facility, which WLR Foods
acquired during fiscal 1993, together with internal turkey
expansion, increased turkey sales pounds by 19.0% over the prior
year.  Cassco's revenues increased 34.2% over fiscal 1993
reflecting a full year of revenues from the two ice acquisitions
in fiscal 1993. Fiscal year 1993 net sales had been up 19.9%
compared to fiscal 1992, a result of volume increases of chicken
and turkey sold.

Fiscal 1994 average quoted commodity prices for chicken and
turkey increased 5.4% and 5.8%, respectively, over prior year
average prices. This trend continued from fiscal 1993, with its
5% increase in average quoted commodity chicken prices and near
level average quoted commodity turkey prices, compared to fiscal
1992.  Although certain average quoted chicken prices have
dropped modestly since the end of fiscal 1994, the average quoted
commodity turkey prices are moving seasonally higher, and above
last year at this time, as the holiday retail whole turkey season
approaches.

Fiscal 1994 cost of sales increased 18.2%, or $97.6 million to
$632.6 million, reflecting increased pounds sold and higher feed
costs. Cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales to
87% for fiscal 1994 compared to 86.8% in fiscal 1993.  The 1994
increase includes $16 million higher feed costs compared to
fiscal 1993.  Per pound processing costs continued to improve
throughout fiscal 1994 as higher volumes were processed and
greater efficiencies were realized in operations.  Fiscal 1993
cost of sales increased 17.8% to $535 million. This increase
reflected a 19.4% jump in sales pounds compared to the prior year
and start-up costs related to the Moorefield chicken complex of
$2.6 million were incurred during fiscal 1993.

Next to labor, grain is the next largest cost of producing and
processing chickens and turkeys.  WLR Foods has several
purchasing mechanisms available to control the cost of grain. 
These include cash purchasing, forward pricing, grain options,
and hedging with futures contracts.  During fiscal 1994, the
Company only used cash purchasing and forward pricing to purchase
grain.  Management has established policies to reduce the risk
associated with positions in grain needed in the future.  The
policies limit the amount of forward priced grain allowed, not to
exceed 50% of  future needs beyond 180 days, thereby reducing
economic risk in the event of a downturn in the grain markets. 
At the close of fiscal 1994, WLR Foods had approximately 50% of
its soybean meal needs forward priced through August 1994 at
prices below $205 per ton delivered.   Management views the use
of these purchasing methods as beneficial to WLR Foods although
grain at a fixed price may create a limited downside risk.  At
the present time, indications are that the grain harvest for 1994
is expected to be markedly better than 1993, which should equate 
to lower grain prices in fiscal 1995.

Disease in birds is another risk when raising poultry, but WLR
Foods uses strict biosecurity measures throughout its operations
to minimize this risk and produce high quality products for its
customers.  Currently, management is not aware of any serious
poultry disease outbreaks in the areas where the company grows
poultry, except North Carolina, where the entire state is
experiencing some early mortality in turkey flocks.  This is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's
operations.

Gross margin remained relatively stable, decreasing a modest 0.2%
from 13.2% in fiscal 1993, to 13.0% in fiscal 1994 -- a result of
the higher grain costs incurred in fiscal 1994.  Gross margin is
expected to improve as grain prices moderate and the company
continues to improve its operating efficiencies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.9
<PAGE>
million, of which $4.8 million was due to normal business
operations.  Additionally, the Company incurred $3.1 million in
advisory fees for its defense of Tyson Foods' attempted takeover
of the Company.  Management anticipates additional advisory fees
will be incurred in fiscal 1995, but they will not be significant
to the total general and administrative expenses. Selling and
advertising expenses were up $1.1 million or 6.6% while sales
volumes increased 15.3%.  Delivery costs rose $4.5 million as a
result of higher volumes sold.  General and administrative
expenses decreased $0.8 million, the result of consolidating the
poultry subsidiaries.  On a year-to-year basis, selling, general
and administrative expenses decreased from 9.0% in fiscal 1993 to
8.7% in fiscal 1994.  This would have been approximately 8.3% if
the defense costs had not been incurred.  In fiscal 1993, WLR
Foods selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.6
million as a result of greater sales volumes, increased
management bonuses and increased profit sharing contributions
over fiscal 1992.

Interest expense rose to nearly $5.0 million in fiscal 1994, up
$1.2 million from fiscal 1993, due to higher interest rates and
increased borrowings during the period.  In fiscal 1993, interest
expense was up $1.1 million with higher borrowing to fund
expansion programs.  Interest capitalized decreased to $0.1
million in fiscal 1994 from $0.8 million in fiscal 1993, as the
major expansion projects began production.

The effective tax rates for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 were
37.4%, 35.5% and 37.3%, respectively.  The increase in taxes in
fiscal 1994 is due to higher federal statutory rates and lower
tax credits available to the Company.  Management expects
effective tax rates in the future to be in the 37% to 38% range
for years of normal operating conditions.

Liquidity and Financial Condition 

WLR Foods working capital position improved substantially in
fiscal 1994.  Working capital was $70.0 million compared to $57.5
million, and current ratios were 2.0-to-1 compared to 1.9-to-1
for fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993, respectively.  Working capital
was generated from earnings and depreciation and was reduced by
capital spending and debt service. The farm price inventory
method was applied to all live inventories with the consolidation
of the poultry subsidiaries. This provided the Company with a one
time tax deferral of approximately $10.0 million, and helped to
offset increases in accounts receivable and inventories. Accounts
receivable increased $11.2 million primarily as the result of
higher sales.  Live inventories were up $5.1 million due to
higher feed costs and increased production.  Other current assets
increased $1.0 million due to the overpayment of current taxes
payable.  The book value of WLR Foods common stock increased to
$14.18 per share, up $1.19 per share from the book value reported
at the end of fiscal 1993.  This increase is reflective of the
earnings of fiscal 1994 decreased by dividends declared.

As of July 2, 1994 total debt-to-total capitalization was 28.5%,
compared to 33.5% at July 3, 1993.  This ratio reflects payment
of long-term debt and earnings in fiscal 1994.  This level is low
for public poultry companies and is expected to move back into
the 40% to 43% range with the acquisition of Cuddy Farms -- USA
Food Division. WLR Foods has $25.6 million remaining on its $35.0
million revolving line of credit.  In June 1994, WLR Foods
entered into an agreement with its participating banks to extend
the current line of credit at the same terms through March 31,
1995.  Management expects to replace and increase the line of
credit facility to meet future needs of WLR Foods.  Indications
suggest the expanded facility will have similar or favorable
terms to the current facility.

Capital Resources

Capital resources are critical to the growth and strength of WLR
Foods.  In fiscal 1994, WLR Foods spent $19.2 million on capital
projects.  The major spending included $3.8 million of the $4.4
million budgeted on a Cassco cold storage warehouse facility.
<PAGE>
Additionally, $1.6 million of $2.0 million budgeted was spent to
improve WLR Foods information system. The system will be
completed in fiscal 1995. Other expenditures included normal
replacement and upgrades of operations.  During fiscal 1994, the
Company took advantage of favorable lease rates available in the
marketplace and leased approximately $0.7 million of rolling
stock, plant equipment and office equipment.

For fiscal 1995, capital spending is budgeted at $23 million,
including $8.0 million to be spent on renovations and
enhancements of Cuddy operations.  In addition, $3.7 million will
be leased.  Except for the Cuddy expenditures, spending will be
for the normal replacement and upgrades of existing equipment. 

The capital spending will be funded through earnings and 
depreciation.  Depreciation for fiscal 1995 is forecast at $24.5
million, including $3.5 million for Cuddy's operations.

Management is committed to grow WLR Foods profitably, enhancing
value for its shareholders. Management expects fiscal 1995 to
continue to provide both profit and growth opportunities for WLR
Foods.

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND                 
        OTHER INFORMATION

Organization
WLR Foods, Inc. (the Company) is primarily engaged in fully 
integrated turkey and chicken production, processing, further
processing and marketing. WLR Foods sells products through a
variety of selected national and international retail,
foodservice and institutional markets.


Fiscal year
The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest
to June 30.  Fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 ended on July 2,
1994, July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, respectively, and included
52 weeks in fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1992, and 53 weeks in fiscal
1993.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of WLR Foods and all of its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries.  All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
Inventories of feed, grain, eggs, packaging supplies, processed
poultry and meat products are stated at the lower of cost or
market as determined by the first-in, first-out valuation method.
Live poultry and breeder flocks consist of poultry raised for
slaughter and breeders.  Poultry raised for slaughter are stated
at the lower of average cost or market. Breeders are stated at
average cost less accumulated amortization.  The costs of
breeders are accumulated during their development stage and then
amortized into the cost of the eggs produced over the egg
production cycle of the breeders, using the straight-line
method.

The Company has four methods of purchasing grain; cash
purchasing, forward pricing,grain options and hedging with
futures contracts. Each purchasing method creates varying degrees
of risk for WLR Foods. As of July 2, 1994, WLR Foods had various
forward contractual agreements for the purchase of soybean meal
at fixed prices. The difference between the forward price
commitment and the current cash price is immaterial.

<PAGE>
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  The costs of
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations, while costs
associated with renewals, improvements and major replacements are
capitalized. 

Income Taxes
Effective July 4, 1993, WLR Foods adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (SFAS No. 109). SFAS No. 109 mandates a change from the
deferred method of accounting for income taxes of APB Opinion 11
to the asset and liability method.  Under the asset and liability
method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to the differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 using the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. The adoption of the new statement
did not have a material effect on the consolidated statement of
earnings or the consolidated balance sheet.

Additionally, the adoption of SFAS No. 109 necessitated the
reclassification of certain amounts which had previously been
recorded net of tax in accordance with APB Opinion 11. The
following accounts were increased (decreased) as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 109.

Property, plant and equipment           $1,589 
Long-term debt                             498 
Current income taxes payable              (857)
Current deferred income taxes payable      413 
Long-term deferred income taxes          1,535 

These reclassifications are only reported to reconcile the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended
July 2, 1994.

Net Earnings Per Common Share
Net earnings per common share are based on the weighted average
number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding
during the fiscal years (10,967,145 shares, 9,322,152 shares and
9,518,220 shares in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively).  Net
earnings are reduced by the preferred stock dividend to arrive at
the net earnings available to common shareholders.  Fully diluted
earnings per share assume the full conversion of the Series L
<PAGE>
Convertible Preferred Stock during the periods they were
outstanding.  Fully diluted earnings per share were based on the
fully diluted weighted average common shares and common share
equivalents of 10,444,348 for fiscal 1993. The impact of the
convertible preferred stock was antidilutive for fiscal 1992,
therefore, the amounts reported for primary and fully diluted
earnings per share are the same. 

Reclassifications
Certain 1993 and 1992 amounts have been reclassified to conform
with fiscal 1994 presentations.

2. Business Acquisitions

In May 1993, the Company acquired assets of two ice manufacturing
and distribution companies for $806,000 cash, $415,200 five-year
notes and $317,700 10-year notes, and 117,796 shares of WLR Foods
common stock valued at $2.6 million. These two operations have
been integrated into the Cassco Ice subsidiary. The acquisitions
were accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the fiscal
1993 statements included herein, reflect the assets
acquired at fair value and the results of operations of 
the acquired companies from the date of acquisition.

On November 27, 1992, the Company acquired Round Hill Foods, Inc.
and affiliated companies (collectively referred to as Round Hill
Foods). Round Hill Foods is located in New Oxford, Pennsylvania
and is engaged in turkey production, processing, and marketing
operations. Its products are sold through a variety of selected
national and international retail, foodservice and industrial
markets. The Company issued 330,472 shares of WLR Foods, common
stock, valued at $6.1 million, paid $1 million in cash and issued
$842,000 of promissory notes payable over five years. In
addition, the Company assumed $11 million of debt. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, all
accounts and transactions of Round Hill Foods are included in the
Company's consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition
date.

As of November 27, 1992, Round Hill Foods had the following
assets and liabilities (in thousands):

     Accounts receivable                $6,518

The following table shows the pro forma results of the Company as
if Round Hill Foods had been acquired at the beginning of the 
respective fiscal years. This information is presented only for

The Company had no agreements to maintain compensating balances
during fiscal 1994, 1993, or 1992. At July 2, 1994 and July 3,
1993, prime rate was 7.25%  and 6.0%, respectively.

The fixed rate notes are unsecured and have a coupon rate of
9.41% with maturity in 2001. Annual principal repayments of $3.0
million began in fiscal 1994, with a final balloon payment of
$9.0 million due in 2001.

The variable rate notes, are unsecured and include an option for
the Company to fix the rate at a later date.  Interest rates were
5.94% at July 2, 1994 and 4.43% at July 3, 1993. Annual principal
repayments of $2.25 million began in fiscal 1994, with final
maturity in 2001. The final payment is a balloon payment of $4.25
million.

Other notes include mortgage notes, industrial development
revenue bonds, and other secured and unsecured notes. No
individual note exceeds $1.1 million at July 2, 1994 and $1.4
million at July 3, 1993. Maturities range from 1994 to 2004 with
coupon rates varying between 4.0% and 10.0%.


The fair value of the fixed rate notes is estimated at $29.3
million based on quoted market prices for similar issues at July
2, 1994. The carrying value of all other debt approximates fair
value at July 2, 1994.

Covenants related to the debt agreements include requirements for
working capital, debt-to-equity, earnings coverage of fixed
charges and disposition of fixed assets.

Required annual principal repayments of long-term debt are as
follows:

Subsequent to year-end the Company entered into a $25.0 million
seven-year variable rate note agreement with its banks. The loan
will be at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 1% and will be repriced as 
of the first of each calendar month. The Company has a 90 day-period 
to draw the funds, which can be used for general corporate purposes.

7. Employee Benefits

The Company maintains a Profit Sharing and Salary Savings Plan
that is available to substantially all employees who meet certain
age and service requirements. Most participants may elect to make
contributions of up to 15% of their salary. For each employee
dollar contributed (limited to the first 4% of an employee's
compensation), the Company is required to contribute a matching
amount of 50 cents. The Company can also make additional
contributions at its discretion. Total Company contributions
under this plan were approximately $2.1 million, $1.5 million,
and $1.0 million, for fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

8. Income Taxes

Effective July 4, 1993, WLR Foods, Inc. adopted SFAS No. 109
"Accounting for Income Taxes." See Note 1 for a discussion of the
effects of the accounting change.


The provisions for income taxes from operations were as follows for
fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992:

At the adoption of SFAS No. 109 management determined a valuation
allowance was unnecessary, and during fiscal 1994 no allowance has
been recorded. Based on the Company's historical earnings, future
expectations of taxable income, the reversing of gross deferred tax
liabilities and potential net operating loss carrybacks, management
anticipates the Company will realize the gross deferred tax assets.

The sources of deferred income taxes and their related tax effects are
as follows for fiscal years 1993 and 1992:

At July 2, 1994, the Company has tax net operating loss carryforwards
of $1.4 million which are available to offset future federal taxable
income, if any through 2009. Additionally, the Company has alternative
minimum tax carryforwards of $0.9 million which are available to
reduce future federal regular income taxes, if any, over an indefinite
period.

9. Shareholders' Equity

In February 1994, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the
Shareholder Protection Rights Plan (the Plan) wherein on February 14,
1994 one right attaches to and trades with each share of common stock.
Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company
at an exercise price of $68, the number of shares of common stock or 
<PAGE>
participating preferred stock having a market value of twice the
exercise price. Such participating preferred stock is designed to have
economic and voting terms similar to those of one share of common
stock. Rights will separate from the common stock and become
exercisable following the earlier of 1) the date a person or group
acquires 15% or more of the outstanding stock, or 2) the tenth
business day (or such later date the Board may decide) after any
person or group commences a tender offer that would result in such 
person or group holding a total of 15% or more of the common stock.
Additionally, rights owned by the acquiring person or group would
automatically become void.

If a person or group acquires between 15% and 50% of the outstanding
common stock, the Board may, in lieu of allowing rights to be
exercised, require each outstanding right to be exchanged for one
share of common stock or participating preferred stock. A provision in
the Plan allows for rights holders to acquire stock of the acquiring
person or group, in the event a change of control of the Company has
occurred.

The rights are redeemable by the Company at $0.01 per right prior to
becoming exercisable and expire ten years from issuance.

10. Stock Option Plan

The Company's Stock Option Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors
in accordance with the Long-Term Incentive Plan which was ratified by
the shareholders of the Company on November 1, 1988.  The Plan
provides for the granting of incentive or nonqualified common stock
options. The option price under the Plan shall not be less than the
fair market value of the common shares as of the date of the grant.
The options vest over a three year period and are exercisable at
varying dates not to exceed ten years from the grant.

The changes in the outstanding common shares under option for fiscal
1994, 1993, and 1992 are listed in the following table:

14. Subsequent event

On August 29, 1994 WLR Foods acquired substantially all of the net
assets of the foods division of Cuddy Farms, Inc., for cash of $43.0
million and 1,183,333 shares of common stock. The acquisition will be
accounted for as a purchase and will be recorded at fair market value. 
The acquisition agreement provides for certain post-closing

adjustments based on audit procedures, which may result in adjustments
to the purchase price. Pursuant to certain rights of this shareholder's
lenders, WLR Foods may be required to purchase the issued shares at a
fixed price of $15 per share. As a result, approximately $17.7
million will be reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheet
as temporary equity reserved for repurchase of the shares.

Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
WLR Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WLR
Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period
ended July 2, 1994.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of WLR Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994 and July 3,
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended July 2, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

        CERTAIN  RELATIONSHIPS  AND  RELATED  TRANSACTIONS

     The Company has always been fortunate to have directors who
are actively involved in, and knowledgeable about, the Company's businesses.  
As a result, the Company has relationships with
certain directors and their families, which relationships are on
the same bases and terms as transactions with unrelated parties. 

     The following table identifies (i) amounts in excess of
$60,000 paid by the Company to each of the directors, members of
their immediate family, and entities related to the directors who
were contract growers with the Company during fiscal year ended
July 2, 1994, and (ii) amounts paid to directors who were contract 
growers if such payments exceeded five percent of the
director's gross revenues for such activity during fiscal year
ended July 2, 1994. All such transactions were on the same bases 
and terms as transactions with unrelated parties. 


                                   Total Amount Received from the
Directors                          Company and its Subsidiaries

              REPORT  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION  COMMITTEE

Compensation Philosophy
     
     The Executive Compensation Committee of the Company's Board
of Directors determines the annual salary, bonus and other
benefits of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and makes
decisions relating to stock option awards to executive officers
and other key personnel pursuant to the Company's Long TermIncentive Plan.  
The Company's overall policy regarding executive
compensation is to provide competitive compensation packages that
attract and retain qualified executives and to reward its
executives for financial and operating results, annual and
long-term, which enhance the value of shareholders' investment inthe Company. 

Base Salary

     The base salary component of executive compensation within the Company 
reflects the first goal stated above of attracting
and retaining qualified executives.  Based on available figures,
the Company executives' base salaries are competitive compared to
other companies within Virginia and the industry.  Periodic
increases in base salary are based on evaluations of past and
current performance, competitive market conditions and Company
performance.

Cash Bonus
     
     The Company's Incentive Bonus Program achieves the second
goal of the Company's compensation philosophy, that of rewarding
financial and operating results on an annual basis.  The Company
developed the Incentive Bonus Program in 1988 with the assistance
of independent executive compensation consultants, and the
Program has been administered since then by the Company's Human
Resource Department for the benefit of executive officers and
other key personnel.  The bonus pool is determined annually by
reference to the Company's return on equity (ROE), and each individual's 
specific bonus allocation is calculated by
multiplying ROE (adjusted for accrued incentive pay and taxes) by
his or her base salary and by a bonus factor which is based on
his or her position within the Company.  As borne out in the
six-year history of the Company's Incentive Bonus Program, for
years in which the Company does not have a strong return on
equity, a significant portion of management's annual compensation
is reduced.  Thus, bonuses comprise the part of management
compensation that is "at risk" based on the Company's annual
performance.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

     Rewarding Company executives on a long-term basis is
accomplished through the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan, a 
stock option plan approved by the Company's shareholders in 1988. 
By encouraging management investment in Company stock, the Plan
aligns management's interests with that of the shareholders;
namely, to enjoy long-term appreciation in the value of the
Company's common stock.
     
     At the Plan's inception, an independent executive
compensation consulting firm recommended the number of options
that should be granted to the Company's executive officers and
other key personnel.  The Executive Compensation Committee 
awarded options at levels below those initially advised by the
consultants and, since then, have awarded options generally
consistent with the first year's levels.  

     During the first three years of option grants, all options
were granted at the market price prevailing at the time of the
grant.  For different reasons, the option price has been
established above the market price in the last three years.  In
1992, the Committee set the price at the prior year-end market
price rather than the then current market price.  The Committee
believed that the prevailing market price plus $3.38 was more
reflective of the true value of the Company's shares at that 
<PAGE>
time.  In 1993, the Company completed a public offering of common
stock priced at $22 in February and the Committee established the
option price in July at $22, even though the market price on the
grant date was $5 lower, or $17 per share.  In 1994, Tyson's
tender offer was $30, so the Committee established the option
price at $30 instead of the 1994 year-end trading value of
$25.50.  

Deferred Compensation
     
     The final significant component of the Chief Executive
Officer's compensation is deferred compensation, serving both
goals of providing a competitive compensation package and
rewarding results.  Mr. Keeler's deferred compensation is essentially 
a retirement plan with payouts beginning the year
after Mr. Keeler retires as Chief Executive Officer, but payouts
are calculated by reference to the increase in the Company's book
value over the term of Mr. Keeler's service.  Specifically, 1.5%
of the annual increase in the Company's book value is allocated 
annually to a deferred compensation account which, together with
accrued interest, is payable to him over a five-year period
beginning in the year after his retirement.  However, if Mr.
Keeler's employment is terminated involuntarily or because of a
change in control of the Company, the balance of Mr. Keeler's 
deferred compensation account becomes payable immediately.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation

     For the last fiscal year, Mr. Keeler received a base salary 
percentage increase of 2%, the average pay increase for all
employees.  This increase maintains a base salary competitive
with chief executive positions within the state and industry. 
Though Mr. Keeler's bonus factor was the same for the last fiscal
year as it has been since 1988, his bonus was lower because the Company's 
ROE was lower.  Mr. Keeler's deferred compensation
allocation was higher than the last fiscal year because, as
described above, deferred compensation is singularly a function
of increase in the Company's book value.  Finally, the number of
stock options awarded Mr. Keeler under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
was the same as it has been for the last five years,
reflecting a systematic effort to enhance Mr. Keeler's personal
financial interest in the strong management of the Company.

     The bonus and deferred compensation awards for Mr. Keeler in 
the last fiscal year are reflected in the Summary Compensation
Table set forth  below and are, as already described, consistent
with improvements in the Company's financial profile.  Indeed,
since the end of fiscal 1988, the first year of Mr. Keeler's
tenure with the Company, the Company's total market capitalization 
has risen from $84,354,400 to $280,737,864 at the
end of fiscal 1994.

EXECUTIVE  AGREEMENTS

     The Company has an employment agreement with the Chief
Executive Officer which expires June 27, 1998.  The agreement 
governs Mr. Keeler's compensation, specifically his base salary,
bonus, perquisites and benefits.  Pursuant to the agreement,
during the current fiscal year, Mr. Keeler's base salary is
$249,998 and his bonus factor, discussed under "Cash Bonus" on
page 9 is 3.6, the same as the past five years.  In any event,
Mr. Keeler is guaranteed a bonus of $25,000.  Mr. Keeler's
deferred compensation allocation will continue to be calculated
at 1.5% of the increase in the Company's book value over each
preceding year, as explained previously under "Deferred
Compensation."   Mr. Keeler's perquisites and benefits are
consistent with those provided to the Company's senior
management.  

     The Company also has entered into severance agreements with
each of James L. Keeler, James L. Mason, V. Eugene Misner,
Henry L. Holler and Kenneth D. Marshall (the Severance
Agreements).  Pursuant to the Severance Agreements, each of these
individuals is entitled to certain payments (described below) if
the Company terminates his employment during a specified period
following a "Change in Control" of the Company.  
     
     For purposes of the Severance Agreements, a "Change in
Control" occurs (A) when an individual, entity or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the combined voting power
of the Company's outstanding stock, subject to certain exceptions
set forth in the executive's severance agreement, (B) when
individuals who as of February 4, 1994 constitute the Board of
Directors (the "Incumbent  Board") and individuals whose
election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of the
Company, was approved by a vote of at least seventy-five percent
of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (who shall
after election be considered members of the Incumbent Board
unless such election occurs as a result of an actual or
threatened election contest or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person
other than the Company's Board of Directors) shall cease to
constitute a majority of the Company's Board of Directors, (C)
upon the approval by the shareholders of the Company of are 
organization, merger or consolidation except in certain
instances set forth in the executive's severance agreement, or
(D) upon approval by the shareholders of the Company of the
complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of 
the Company, except in certain instances set forth in the
Severance Agreements.  

     The Severance Agreements for each of Messrs. Keeler and
Mason provide that if the Company terminates his employment during 
the three year period following a Change in Control of the
Company, other than for death, Cause (willful and continued
failure to perform duties or willful engaging in illegal conduct: 
defined more specifically in the Severance Agreements) or
Disability (as defined in the Severance Agreement), or if here 
signs for Good Reason (includes an adverse change in status or
position, a reduction in base salary or benefits, or relocation: 
defined more specifically in the Severance Agreements) during
such three year period, he is entitled to receive an amount in
cash (the Severance Payment) equal to three times his total 
annual compensation, which includes:  (A) the higher of (x) his
annual base salary on the date of termination or (y) his annual
base salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control
and (B) an amount equal to the average of the bonuses awarded to
him in each of the three previous years, including, in the case 
of Mr. Keeler, any bonuses awarded pursuant to any deferred
compensation arrangements.  In the event that such payments
become subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code (or any similar tax), the employee shall be
entitled to receive a "gross-up" payment in respect of such taxes 
and in respect of any taxes on such gross-up payment as specified
in his Severance Agreement.  These Severance Agreements also
provide for the continuation of employee welfare benefits (such
as health insurance) for three years after termination if his
employment is terminated during such three year period.  In
addition, Mr. Keeler will be entitled to receive the Severance
Payment and other severance benefits if he resigns for any reason
during the 30-day period immediately following the first
anniversary of a Change in Control.  The Severance Agreements for
Messrs. Misner, Holler and Marshall are similar to those 
described above for Mr. Mason except they cover a two year period
after a Change in Control, the amount payable is equal to one and
one-half times his total annual compensation, and employee
welfare benefits will continue for one and one-half years if his
employment is terminated during such two year period.
