Item 1. Business.
 
     H. J. Heinz Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania on July 27, 1900. In
1905 it succeeded to the business of a partnership operating under the same name
which had developed from a food business founded in 1869 at Sharpsburg,
Pennsylvania by Henry J. Heinz. H. J. Heinz Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or the "Registrant" unless the context
indicates otherwise) manufacture and market an extensive line of processed food
products throughout the world. The Company's products include ketchup, tuna and
other seafood products, pet food, baby food, frozen potato products,
lower-calorie products (frozen entrees, frozen desserts, frozen breakfasts,
dairy and other products), soup (canned and frozen), sauces/pastes, beans,
condiments and pickles, coated products, pasta, bakery products, frozen pizza
and pizza components, chicken, vegetables (frozen and canned), ice cream and ice
cream novelties, edible oils, vinegar, margarine/shortening, juices and other
processed food products. The Company operates principally in one segment of
business--processed food products--which represents more than 90% of
consolidated sales. The Company also operates and franchises weight control
classes and operates other related programs and activities. The Company intends
to continue to engage principally in the business of manufacturing and marketing
processed food products and the ingredients for food products.
 
     The Company's products are manufactured and packaged to provide safe,
stable, wholesome foods which are used directly by consumers and foodservice and
institutional customers. Many products are prepared from recipes developed in
the Company's research laboratories and experimental kitchens. Ingredients are
carefully selected, washed, trimmed, inspected and passed on to modern factory
kitchens where they are processed, after which the finished product is filled
automatically into containers of glass, metal, plastic, paper or fiberboard
which are then closed, processed, labeled and cased for market. Finished
products are processed by sterilization, chilling, freezing, pickling, drying,
baking or extruding. Certain finished products and seasonal raw materials are
aseptically packed into sterile containers after in-line sterilization.
 
     The Company has three classes of similar products, each of which has
accounted for 10% or more of consolidated sales in one or more of the prior
three fiscal years listed below. The following table shows sales, as a
percentage of consolidated sales, for each of these classes of similar products
for each of the last three fiscal years.

     The Company manufactures its products from a wide variety of raw foods.
Pre-season contracts are made with farmers for a substantial portion of raw
materials such as tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, onions and some other fruits
and vegetables. Dairy products, meat, sugar, spices, flour and other fruits and
vegetables are purchased on the open market.
 
     Tuna is obtained through direct negotiations with tuna vessel owners,
negotiated contracts directly with the owners or through the owners'
cooperatives and by bid-and-ask transactions. In some instances, in order to
insure the continued availability of adequate supplies of tuna, the Company
assists, directly or indirectly, in financing the acquisition and operation of
fishing vessels. The provision of such assistance is not expected to affect
materially the operations of the Company. The Company also engages in the tuna
fishing business through wholly and partially owned subsidiaries.
 
     The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (the "Act"), and
regulations thereunder (the "Regulations") regulate the incidental taking of
dolphin in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical
Pacific Ocean, where a portion of the Company's light-meat tuna is caught. In
1990, the Company voluntarily adopted a worldwide policy of refusal to purchase
tuna caught in the eastern tropical
 
                                       2

<PAGE>
Pacific Ocean through the intentional encirclement of dolphin by purse seine
nets and reaffirmed its policy of not purchasing tuna caught anywhere using gill
nets or drift nets. Also in 1990, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information
Act (the "Dolphin Information Act") was enacted which regulates the labeling of
tuna products as "dolphin safe" and bans the importation of tuna caught using
high seas drift nets. "Dolphin Safe" labels appear on the Company's StarKist
tuna products in grocery stores throughout the United States. The Act was
amended in 1992 to further regulate tuna fishing methods which involve marine
mammals. Compliance with the Act, the Regulations, the Dolphin Information Act,
the Company's voluntary policy, and the 1992 amendments has not had, and is not
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.
 
     In recent years, the supply of raw tuna has been variable causing a
fluctuation in raw fish prices; however, such variation in supply has not
affected materially, nor is it expected to affect materially, the Company's
operations.
 
     The Company has participated in the development of certain of its food
processing equipment, some of which is patented. The Company regards these
patents as important but does not consider any one or group of them to be
materially important to its business as a whole.
 
     The Company's products are widely distributed around the world. Many of the
Company's products are marketed under the "Heinz" trademark, principally in the
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other western European countries,
Australia, Venezuela, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of
Korea and Thailand. Other important trademarks include "Star-Kist" for tuna
products, "9-Lives", "Amore" and "Kozy Kitten" for cat foods, "Ore-Ida" for
frozen potato and onion products, "Skippy Premium", "Recipe", "Reward" and
"Vets" for dog food, "Jerky Treats" and "Meaty Bones" for dog snacks, "Bagel
Bites" for pizza snack products, "Moore's" for coated vegetables and "Domani"
for frozen pasta products, all of which are marketed in the United States. "Chef
Francisco" is used for frozen soups and "Omstead" is used for frozen vegetables,
frozen coated products and frozen fish products, both of which are marketed in
the United States and Canada. "Plasmon", "Nipiol" and "Dieterba" are used for
baby food products, "Misura" for dietetic products for adults, "Ortobuono" for
pickled vegetables and fruit in syrup, "Mare D'Oro" for seafood and "Mr. Foody"
for table and kitchen sauces, all of which are mainly marketed in Italy. "Petit
Navire" is used for tuna and mackerel products, "Marie Elisabeth" for sardines
and tuna and "Orlando" and "Guloso" for tomato products, all of which are
marketed in various European countries. "Wattie's" is used for various grocery
products and frozen foods, "Tip Top" for ice cream and frozen desserts and
"Tegel" for poultry products, all of which are marketed in New Zealand,
Australia and the Asia/Pacific region. "Weight Watchers" is used in numerous
countries in conjunction with owned and franchised weight control classes,
programs, related activities and certain food products. The Company also markets
certain products under other trademarks and brand names and under private
labels.
 
     Although crops constituting some of the Company's raw food ingredients are
harvested on a seasonal basis, most of the Company's products are produced
throughout the year. Seasonal factors inherent in the business have always
influenced the quarterly sales and net income of the Company. Consequently,
comparisons between quarters have always been more meaningful when made between
the same quarters of different years.
 
     The products of the Company are sold under highly competitive conditions,
with many large and small competitors. The Company regards its principal
competition to be other manufacturers of processed foods, including branded,
retail products, foodservice products and private label products, that compete
with the Company for consumer preference, distribution, shelf space and
merchandising support. Product quality and consumer value are important areas of
competition. The Company's Weight Watchers International, Inc. subsidiary also
competes with a wide variety of weight control programs.
 
     The Company's products are sold through its own sales force and through
independent brokers and agents to chain, wholesale, cooperative and independent
grocery accounts, to foodservice distributors and to institutions, including
hotels, restaurants and certain government agencies. The Company is not
dependent on any single customer or a few customers for a material part of its
sales.
 
     Compliance with the provisions of national, state and local environmental
laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon the capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. The Company's
estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the
remainder of fiscal
                                       3
<PAGE>
year 1995 and the succeeding fiscal year are not material and will not
materially affect either the earnings or competitive position of the Company.
 
     The Company's factories are subject to inspections by various governmental
agencies, and its products must comply with the applicable laws, including food
and drug laws, of the jurisdictions in which they are manufactured and marketed.
 
     The Company employed, on a full-time basis as of April 27, 1994,
approximately 35,700 persons around the world.
 
     Financial segment information by major geographic area for the most recent
three fiscal years is set forth on page 38 of the Company's Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended April 27, 1994. Such information is
incorporated herein by reference.
 
     Income from international operations is subject to fluctuation in currency
values, export and import restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions, economic
controls and other factors. From time to time exchange restrictions imposed by
various countries have restricted the transfer of funds between countries and
between the Company and its subsidiaries. To date such exchange restrictions
have not had a material adverse effect on the Company's international
operations.
 
Item 2. Properties.
 
     The Company has 44 food processing plants in the United States and its
possessions, of which 39 are owned and five are leased, as well as 44 food
processing plants in foreign countries, of which 39 are owned and five are
leased, including six in Canada, six in New Zealand, four in Australia, four in
the United Kingdom, three in Italy, three in Spain, two in Greece, two in
Portugal, two in Zimbabwe, two in Botswana, one in France, one in Ireland, one
in The Netherlands, one in Venezuela, one in Japan, one in the People's Republic
of China, one in Ghana, one in the Republic of Korea, one in Thailand and one in
Ecuador. The Company also leases one can-making factory in the United States.
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries also own or lease office space,
warehouses and research facilities. The Company's food processing plants and
principal properties are in good condition and are satisfactory for the purposes
for which they are being utilized.
 
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
 
     On December 31, 1992, a food wholesale distributor filed suit in Federal
District Court in Newark, New Jersey against the Company and its two principal
competitors in the United States baby food industry. Subsequent to that date,
several similar lawsuits have been filed in the same court. The complaints, each
of which seeks an injunction and unspecified treble money damages, allege a
conspiracy to fix, maintain and stabilize the prices of baby food. All of the
above actions have been consolidated and styled In Re Baby Food Antitrust
Litigation, No. 92-5495 (NHP) and are pending in the Federal District Court in
Newark, New Jersey. In September 1993, the court authorized class certification
providing that the case will proceed as a class action. In addition, an action
has been filed in state court in San Francisco under California state law
against the Company and its two principal competitors. An action filed in
Alabama state court relating to the same matters has been stayed pending a
decision in the New Jersey case. The plaintiffs in the California and Alabama
actions seek to represent a class of indirect purchasers of baby food in the
respective states. The Company believes all of the suits are without merit and
will defend itself vigorously against them.
 
     On June 29, 1994, pursuant to an agreement with the United States Attorney
for the District of Oregon, which was approved by the Federal District Court in
Oregon, the Federal District Court imposed a $1,000,000 fine on the Company's
Ore-Ida Foods, Inc. subsidiary ("Ore-Ida") and placed Ore-Ida on probation for
three years. The agreement permits Ore-Ida to invest $750,000 of the fine in
additional wastewater treatment processes. The agreement concerns violations of
Ore-Ida's NPDES permit at its Ontario, Oregon plant during a period from March
1988 through March 1990 which were reported previously in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 28, 1993.
 
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
     The Company has not submitted any matters to a vote of security holders
since the last annual meeting of shareholders on September 8, 1993.

NOTES:
(1)  Principally reserves on assets sold, written off or reclassified.
 
(2)  The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was a
     decrease of $56.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to the
     utilization of loss carryforwards ($2.8 million) and recognition of the
     realizability of certain other deferred tax assets in future years ($57.3
     million). An increase in the valuation allowance related to the deferred
     tax asset for loss carryforwards ($4.7 million) partially offset the
     decrease. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 45
     and 46 of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year
     ended April 27, 1994.
 
(3)  The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was a
     decrease of $54.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to the
     utilization of loss carryforwards ($5.3 million), amortization of asset
     revaluations ($10.7 million) and recognition of the realizability of

certain of the voting rights, designations, preferences, privileges,
qualifications, limitations, options and common rights, and of certain of the

Directors of the corporation pursuant to the aforesaid authority, viz.:
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
Subsection A. Issuance in Series.
 
     Subparagraph (1). The Third Preferred Stock shall be divided into and from
time to time may be issued in series, and the Board of Directors is hereby
expressly vested with the authority, in the resolution or resolutions providing
for the issue of shares of particular series, before issuance, to fix and
determine:
 
          (a) the distinctive serial designation of such series;
 
          (b) the annual dividend rate for such series, and the date from which
     such dividends shall commence to accrue;
 
          (c) the full, limited, multiple, fractional or no voting rights of
     such series;
 
          (d) the redemption price or prices for such series, which may consist
     of a redemption price or scale of redemption prices applicable only to
     redemption for a sinking fund (which term as used herein shall include any
     fund or requirement for the periodic retirement of shares) and a different
     redemption price or scale of redemption prices applicable to any other
     redemption, and the terms and conditions on which shares of such series may
     be redeemed;
 
          (e) the sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or
     purchase of shares of such series;
 
          (f) the amounts payable upon shares of such series in the event of the
     voluntary or involuntary liquidation of the corporation; and
 
          (g) the terms and conditions, if any, upon which shares of such series
     may be converted and the class or classes or series of shares of the
     corporation into which such shares may be converted.
 
     Subparagraph (2). All shares of the Third Preferred Stock shall be of equal
rank with each other, regardless of series, and shall be identical with each
other in all respects except as provided in subparagraph (1) of this Subsection
A.
 
     Subparagraph (3). In case the stated dividends and the amounts payable on
liquidation are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the Third
Preferred Stock shall share ratably in the payment of dividends, including
accruals, if any, in proportion to the sums which would be payable on said
shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full, and in any distribution
of assets other than by way of dividends in accordance with the sums which would
be payable on such distribution if all sums payable were discharged in full.
 
Subsection B. Dividends on Third Preferred Stock and Junior Stock.
 
     The holders of the Third Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when
and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally
available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the annual
rate for each particular series theretofore fixed by the Board of Directors as
hereinbefore authorized, and no more, payable quarter-yearly, on the first days
of January, April, July and October in each year, to shareholders of record on
the respective dates, not exceeding forty days preceding such dividend payment
dates, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of
each particular dividend. Such dividends on the Third Preferred Stock shall be
payable before any dividend on any junior stock (which term as used in this
Section I shall mean the Common Stock and any other class of stock of the
corporation hereafter authorized ranking junior to the Third Preferred Stock as
to dividends or assets) shall be paid or set apart for payment. Dividends on
each series of the Third Preferred Stock shall be cumulative from such date as
may be fixed by the Board of Directors prior to the issue thereof. Arrearages in
the payment of dividends shall not bear interest.
 
     So long as any of the Third Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no
dividend whatever shall be paid or declared on any junior stock nor shall any
distribution be made on any junior stock, other than a dividend payable in
junior stock, nor shall any shares of any junior stock be acquired for a
consideration by the corporation:
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
          (1) unless all dividends on the Third Preferred Stock of all series
     for all past quarter-yearly dividend periods shall have been paid and the
     full dividends thereon for the then current quarter-yearly dividend period
     shall have been paid or shall have been declared and a sum sufficient for
     the payment thereof set apart; and
 
          (2) unless, if at any time the corporation is obligated to retire
     shares of any series of the Third Preferred Stock pursuant to a sinking
     fund, all arrears in respect of each sinking fund for the Third Preferred
     Stock of all series shall have been made good.
 
     Subject to the foregoing provisions, and not otherwise, such dividends
(payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of
Directors may be declared and paid on any junior stock from time to time out of
the remaining funds of the corporation legally available for the payment of
dividends, and the Third Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in
any such dividends, whether payable in cash, stock or otherwise.
 
Subsection C. Redemption.
 
     Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (3) of Subsection E of this
Section I and subject to the provisions of the resolution or resolutions of the
Board of Directors providing for the issue of shares of any particular series,
the corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors, may redeem the whole
or any part of the Third Preferred Stock at any time outstanding, or the whole
or any part of any series thereof, at any time or from time to time, upon notice
duly given as hereinafter specified, at the applicable redemption price or
prices fixed by the Board of Directors as hereinbefore authorized, together with
a sum, in the case of each share so to be redeemed, computed at the annual
dividend rate for the series of which the particular share is a part from and
after the date on which dividends on such share became cumulative to and
including the date fixed for such redemption, less the aggregate of the
dividends theretofore paid thereon, but computed without interest.
 
     Notice of every such redemption of the Third Preferred Stock shall be
published at least once in a newspaper printed in the English language and
customarily published on each business day and of general circulation in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and in a similar newspaper
similarly published and of general circulation in the City of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, and in a similar newspaper similarly published and of general
circulation in such other city or cities as may be specified in the resolution
or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issue of shares of
any particular series, such publications to be at least thirty days prior to the
date fixed for such redemption. Notice of every such redemption shall also be
mailed at least thirty days prior to the date fixed for such redemption to the
holders of record of the shares so to be redeemed at their respective addresses
as the same shall appear on the books of the corporation; but no failure to mail
such notice nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the
validity of the proceeding for the redemption of any shares so to be redeemed.
 
     In case of redemption of a part only of any series of the Third Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, the redemption may be either pro rata or by lot.
The Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the
manner in which the drawings by lot or the pro rata redemption shall be
conducted and, subject to the provisions herein contained, the terms and
conditions upon which the Third Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to
time.
 
     On or at any time before any redemption date, the corporation may deposit
in trust, for the account of the holders of the shares to be redeemed, the
moneys necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust company, to be
designated in the notice of such redemption, in good standing, having capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $5,000,000, organized under
the laws of the United States of America or of the State of New York, doing
business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, or
organized under the laws of the United States of America or of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and doing business in the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In
the event such deposit is so made, then, upon the publication, as hereinabove
provided, of the notice of such redemption, or upon the earlier delivery to said
bank or trust company of irrevocable authorization and direction to publish such
notice, all shares with respect to the redemption of which such deposit shall
have been made and such publication
                                       3
<PAGE>
effected or authorization therefor given shall, whether or not the certificates
for such shares shall have been surrendered for cancellation, be deemed to be no
longer outstanding for any purpose, and all rights with respect to such shares
shall thereupon cease and terminate except the right of the holders of the
certificates for such shares to receive, from and after the time of such
deposit, the amount payable upon the redemption thereof, without interest, and
the right to exercise, on or before the date fixed for redemption, any unexpired
privileges of conversion.
 
     Any funds so deposited by the corporation which shall not be required for
such redemption because of the exercise of any right of conversion or exchange
subsequent to the time of such deposit shall be released or repaid to the
corporation forthwith. Any funds so deposited which are unclaimed at the end of
six years from such redemption date shall be repaid to the corporation, after
which the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the
corporation for payment thereof, provided, however, that if any unclaimed funds
so repaid to the corporation shall have been paid by it to the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania under or in lieu of escheat, the holders of the shares so called
for redemption shall thenceforth look only to the said Commonwealth for the
payment thereof.
 
Subsection D. Amounts Payable on Liquidation or Dissolution.
 
     In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Third
Preferred Stock of each series then outstanding shall be entitled to receive in
cash out of the assets of the corporation, before any distribution or payment
shall be made to the holders of any junior stock, the full preferential amount
or amounts fixed by the Board of Directors for such series as herein authorized,
plus in respect of each such share a sum computed at the annual dividend rate
applicable thereto from and after the date on which dividends on such share
became cumulative to and including the date fixed for such payment, less the
aggregate of dividends theretofore paid thereon, but computed without interest;
provided that if such assets available for the holders of the Third Preferred
Stock of each series then outstanding shall be less than the total amount all
such holders would be so entitled to receive if all such preferential amount or
amounts and dividends were paid in full then the corporation shall, in lieu of
making such payments in full to the holders of the Third Preferred Stock of each
series then outstanding, make payments to the holders of the Third Preferred
Stock of each series then outstanding (in proportion to the respective amounts
which would be payable on account of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up
if all such payments were paid in full) of an aggregate amount equal to such
assets so available. If such payment shall have been made in full to the holders
of the Third Preferred Stock on voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, the remaining assets of the corporation shall be
distributed among the holders of junior stock according to their respective
rights and preferences and in accordance with their respective holdings. For the
purposes of this Subsection D, a consolidation or merger of the corporation with
any other corporation shall not be deemed, as such, to constitute a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation, but any reorganization of the
corporation required by any court or administrative body in order to comply with
any provision of law shall be deemed to be an involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation unless the preferences,
qualifications, limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights granted
to or imposed upon the Third Preferred Stock are not adversely affected by such
reorganization.
 
Subsection E. Restrictions on Corporate Action.
 
     The consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Third Preferred
Stock (subject to the provisions of subparagraph (2) hereof) at the time
outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a special
meeting called for the purpose, at which the Third Preferred Stock entitled to
vote shall vote separately as a class, regardless of series, shall be necessary
to effect or validate any one or more of the following:
 
          Subparagraph (1). The authorization of, or any increase in the
     authorized amount of, any class of stock of the corporation ranking prior
     to or on a parity with the Third Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or
     upon liquidation, or any increase in the authorized amount of the Third
     Preferred Stock;
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
          Subparagraph (2). The amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the
     provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as now or hereafter
     amended, of the corporation, or any of the provisions of the resolution or
     resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issue of shares of
     any series of the Third Preferred Stock, so as to affect adversely the
     rights, preferences or powers of the Third Preferred Stock or of any series
     of the Third Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if any such
     amendment, alteration or repeal shall affect adversely the rights,
     preferences or powers of one or more, but not all, of the series of Third
     Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the consent of the holders of at
     least two-thirds in interest of the shares then outstanding of each series
     so affected entitled to vote, similarly given, shall be required in lieu of
     the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the Third Preferred Stock
     entitled to vote voting as a class; or
 
          Subparagraph (3). The redemption of less than all of the Third
     Preferred Stock at the time outstanding or the purchase of any of the Third
     Preferred Stock except in accordance with a purchase offer made to all
     holders thereof, unless the full dividend on the Third Preferred Stock for
     all past quarter-yearly dividend periods shall have been paid or declared
     and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart;
 
provided that no consent of the holders of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to
vote or of the holders of a particular series of the Third Preferred Stock
entitled to vote shall be required under the provisions of this Subsection E if,
at or prior to the time of the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required, provision is made in accordance with the provisions of
the fourth paragraph of Subsection C of this Section I for the redemption of all
shares of Third Preferred Stock or of all shares of the particular series of the
Third Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.
 
     If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any requirements to
retire shares of the Third Preferred Stock are not paid in full in the case of
all series with respect to which such requirements exist, the number of shares
to be retired in each series shall be in proportion to the respective amounts
which would be payable on account of such requirements if all amounts payable
were met in full.
 
Subsection F. Voting Rights.
 
     Holders of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to vote shall be entitled to
vote together with the Common Stock and not as a separate class on all matters
at every meeting of the holders of Common Stock of the corporation, and, in
addition, holders of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to vote shall be
entitled to vote, separately as a class, to the extent provided in Subsection E
above, and as hereinafter in this Subsection F set forth. If and when six
quarter-yearly dividends payable on the Third Preferred Stock of any series
shall be in default, in whole or in part, the holders of the outstanding Third
Preferred Stock entitled to vote, voting separately as a class regardless of
series, shall, in addition to the voting rights provided in Subsection E of this
Section I and hereinabove provided in this Subsection F, become entitled to
elect two Directors, who shall be additional Directors to the then existing
Board, and the holders of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to vote and the
Common Stock, voting together, shall be entitled to elect the remaining
Directors of the corporation. When all dividends then in default on the Third
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall thereafter be paid, the Third Preferred
Stock shall then be divested of such additional voting power, but always subject
to the same provisions for the vesting of such additional voting power in the
Third Preferred Stock entitled to vote in case of any similar future default or
defaults. A meeting of the holders of the Third Preferred Stock for the election
of such Directors, at which the holders of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to
vote shall vote as a class, shall be held at any time after the accrual of such
additional voting power, upon notice similar to that provided in the By-Laws for
a special meeting of shareholders, upon call by the Secretary of the
corporation, who shall call such meeting at the written request of the holders
of record of not less than 5% of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to vote then
outstanding, addressed to him at the principal business office of the
corporation. The holders of a majority of the Third Preferred Stock entitled to
vote present in person or by proxy shall be entitled to elect the additional
Directors above provided for. Upon termination of the additional voting power of
the Third Preferred Stock at any time by reason of the payment of all
accumulated and defaulted dividends on such
                                       5
<PAGE>
stock, the terms of office of all persons who may have been elected Directors of
the corporation by vote of the holders of the Third Preferred Stock shall
forthwith terminate.
 
     At all times each holder of a share of the Third Preferred Stock of any
series who at the time possessed voting power for any purpose shall, for such
purpose, be entitled to such vote, or no vote, for each share of the Third
Preferred Stock standing in such holder's name on the books of the corporation
as shall have been theretofore fixed by the Board of Directors as hereinbefore
authorized.
 
Subsection G. Status of Redeemed and Purchased Shares.
 
     Except as otherwise required by law, all shares of the Third Preferred
Stock redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation shall be
cancelled and shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares, and the
Board of Directors of the corporation shall have authority, by resolution, to
change shares of any particular series redeemed or purchased into shares of
another series of the Third Preferred Stock, subject to such limitations, if
any, as are stated in the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as now or
hereafter amended, of the corporation. However, no shares of the Third Preferred
Stock of any series redeemed or purchased (whether or not so changed into shares
of another series) shall be re-issued as a part of such series or any other
series of the Third Preferred Stock so long as any shares of the Third Preferred
Stock of such series shall remain outstanding. Any such cancellation of shares
of any series of the Third Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to Subsection C of
this Section I shall not prevent the corporation from subsequently using such
shares in satisfaction of sinking fund requirements with respect to the same
series if and to the extent permitted by the terms of such series.
 
Subsection H. Status of Converted Shares.
 
     Upon conversion of any shares of any series of the Third Preferred Stock
into another class or classes or series of shares of the corporation pursuant to
the provisions of the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors
providing for the issue of such series, the number of shares which the
corporation is authorized to issue shall be thereby so reduced.
 
Subsection I. Relative Rights and Preferences of the First Series of Third
Cumulative Preferred Stock.
 
     Pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the
corporation on December 10, 1975 the first series of the Third Cumulative
Preferred Stock was established, such series having originally consisted of
1,800,000 shares but having been thereafter reduced to 38,876 shares through
conversion and cancellation, the designation and the relative rights and
preferences thereof, in addition to those set forth in Subsections A through H
of this Section I, being as follows:
 
          (1) The designation is "Third Cumulative Preferred Stock, $1.70 First
     Series" (hereinafter called the "First Series")
 
          (2) The amount of $1.70 per share of the First Series per year, and no
     more, is hereby fixed as the rate per annum at which the holders of shares
     of the First Series shall be entitled to receive dividends; and the date of
     issue of the First Series is hereby fixed as the date from and after which
     such dividends shall accumulate.
 
          (3) Each holder of a share of the First Series shall have voting
     rights and shall be entitled to one-half vote for each share of the First
     Series standing in such holder's name on the books of the corporation.
 
          (4) The shares of the First Series are redeemable in whole or in part
     at any time. The redemption price payable upon the exercise of the right to
     redeem the shares of the First Series is fixed at $28.50 plus dividends
     accrued and unpaid thereon to the date fixed for redemption. In addition to
     the publication of notice of redemption in the newspapers specified in
     Subsection C of this Section I, such notice shall also be published in the
     City of Keokuk, Iowa.
 
          (5) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
     winding up of the corporation the holders of shares of the First Series
     shall be entitled to receive at the time thereof in cash out of the assets
     of the corporation, before any distribution or payment shall be made to the
     holders of any junior
                                       6
<PAGE>
     stock, an amount equal to the redemption price of $28.50 plus dividends
     accrued and unpaid thereon to such time.
 
          (6) At the option of the holder thereof and upon surrender to the
     corporation at the office of a Transfer Agent of the Common Stock, either
     in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York or in the City
     of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, each share of the First Series shall be
     convertible (or if such share is called for redemption, then in respect of
     such share to and including but not after the date fixed for such
     redemption), into fully paid non-assessable shares of Common Stock of the
     corporation (as such Common Stock shall then be constituted) at the
     conversion rate of 9.0 shares of Common Stock per share of stock of the
     First Series, the conversion rate having been previously adjusted from the
     initial conversion rate through the date of these Amended and Restated
     Articles of Incorporation pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this Paragraph 6
     being subject to further adjustment as hereinafter provided:
 
             (a) If and whenever the corporation shall at any time after the
           date of issue of the First Series make any distribution described in
           paragraph (b) below or issue any shares of Common Stock (excluding
           shares of Common Stock or other securities issued upon the
           conversion of shares of the First Series, and excluding shares of
           Common Stock or other securities issued on the exercise of options
           and warrants outstanding on the date of issue of the First Series,
           and excluding shares of Common Stock or other securities issued on
           the exercise of options granted at any time after the date of issue
           of the First Series pursuant to any option plan for employees of the
           corporation or its subsidiaries, all of which are hereinafter in this
           Paragraph (6) referred to as "Excluded Shares"), then successively
           upon each such distribution or issuance the conversion rate shall be
           immediately (except as provided in subparagraph (g) below) adjusted
           in accordance with the following formula:
 
                $28.50 shall be multiplied by the number of shares of Common
           Stock outstanding after any such issuance (other than Excluded
           Shares) and the resulting product shall be divided by the aggregate
           consideration, determined in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this
           Paragraph (6), received by the corporation for shares of Common Stock
           then outstanding (other than Excluded Shares). The resulting
           quotient, adjusted to the nearest one-thousandth, shall thereafter be
           the conversion rate until further adjusted as herein provided, except
           that if by any such computation the current conversion rate would be
           decreased to less than the basic conversion rate as defined in
           subparagraph (d) of this Paragraph (6), then the conversion rate
           shall nevertheless be the basic conversion rate.
 
             (b) For the purpose of this Paragraph (6), the corporation shall be
           deemed to have received as consideration for the shares of its Common
           Stock outstanding at the time of making any computation hereunder
           $862,332,309, minus the aggregate of the amount (as valued by the
           Board of Directors) of all distributions (other than dividends
           payable in cash and/or in equity or other securities of the
           corporation) which have been made payable to holders of Common Stock
           as of a record date occurring after the date of issue of the First
           Series, plus any additional consideration received by the
           corporation after the date of issue of the First Series (other than
           the consideration received by the corporation in connection with the
           issue of shares of the First Series), which additional consideration
           shall be determined as follows:
 
                (i) In the case of the issuance of shares for cash, the
             consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no
             case under this subparagraph (b) shall any deduction be made for
             any underwriting discounts or commissions or any expenses incurred
             by the corporation for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise
             in connection therewith;
 
                (ii) In the case of the issuance of shares for a consideration
             in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than
             cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by
             the Board of Directors;
 
                (iii) In the case of shares issued as a stock dividend, no
             consideration shall be deemed to have been received therefor and
             such securities shall be deemed to have been issued at the
                                       7
<PAGE>
             close of business on the record date for the determination of
             shareholders entitled to receive the same; and
 
                (iv) In case the corporation shall at any time after the date of
             issue of the First Series issue any new securities, other than the
             shares of the First Series, convertible into Common Stock, or any
             options (other than options granted pursuant to any option plan for
             employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries) or rights
             (including warrants) to subscribe to Common Stock, the shares of
             Common Stock issuable on the conversion of any such securities or
             upon the exercise of any such options or rights shall (A) if
             inclusion thereof would result in a current conversion rate greater
             than if excluded be deemed (so long as such conversion or purchase
             privilege is outstanding), for the purpose of the computation made
             pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph (6), to have been
             forthwith issued and (B) in every other case shall be deemed to be
             issued at the close of business on the date of conversion of such
             convertible securities or exercise of such options or rights. The
             corporation for the purpose of any computation under this
             subdivision (iv) shall be deemed to have received a consideration
             for such Common Stock equal to the consideration received by the
             corporation for the convertible securities, options or rights so
             issued, plus the consideration, if any, to be received by the
             corporation upon their conversion or the exercise of any such
             options or rights, as the case may be.
 
             (c) For the purpose of this Paragraph (6), a sale or other
        disposition by the corporation of its securities which had been issued
        and outstanding and were acquired by the corporation and which have not
        been retired, or an issuance of Common Stock to the corporation upon
        conversion of shares of the First Series held by it, or a sale or other
        disposition by it of such Common Stock, or a purchase or other
        acquisition by it of its securities, shall not effect, result in or
        require any adjustment in the conversion rate or be taken into account
        in computing any future adjustment in the conversion rate.
 
             (d) In case shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall be
        subdivided into a greater or consolidated into a lesser number of
        shares, either with or without par value, then the current conversion
        rate and the basic conversion rate shall be proportionately increased or
        decreased, as the case may be, and in the case of a stock dividend, the
        basic conversion rate shall be proportionately increased. The basic
        conversion rate as used in this Paragraph (6) shall mean the conversion
        rate hereinbefore stated, as such conversion rate may be adjusted from
        time to time pursuant to this subparagraph (d); provided that if any
        such adjustment of the basic conversion rate has once been made, then
        each subsequent adjustment thereof shall be made with respect to the
        last previously established basic conversion rate.
 
             (e) In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares
        of Common Stock of the class issuable upon conversion of the shares of
        the First Series (other than a change from no par value to par value, or
        from par value to no par value, or a change in par value, or as a result
        of a subdivision or consolidation of shares), or in case of any
        consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into another
        corporation (other than a merger with a subsidiary in which merger the
        corporation is the continuing corporation and which does not result in
        any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock of
        the class issuable upon conversion of the shares of the First Series),
        or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the
        property of the corporation as an entirety or substantially as an
        entirety, the holder of each share of the First Series then outstanding
        shall have the right thereafter (or if such share is called for
        redemption, then in respect of such share to and including but not after
        the date fixed for such redemption), to convert such share into the kind
        and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property
        receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger,
        sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
        of the corporation into which such share might have been converted
        immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation,
        merger, sale or conveyance.
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
             (f) In case at any time conditions shall arise by reason of action
        taken by the corporation which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors
        of the corporation, are not adequately covered by the other provisions
        of this Paragraph (6) and which might materially and adversely affect
        the conversion rights pertaining to the shares of the First Series, or
        in case at any time any such conditions are expected to arise by reason
        of any action contemplated by the corporation, the Board of Directors of
        the corporation shall appoint a firm of independent public accountants
        of recognized standing (which may be the firm that regularly examines
        the financial statements of the corporation) who shall give their
        opinion as to the adjustment, if any (not inconsistent with the
        standards established in this Paragraph (6)), of the conversion rate
        (including, if necessary, any adjustment as to the securities into which
        the shares of the First Series may thereafter be converted) which is, or
        would be, required to preserve without dilution the conversion rights
        pertaining to the shares of the First Series. The Board of Directors
        shall make the adjustment recommended forthwith upon the receipt of such
        opinion or the taking of any such action contemplated, as the case may
        be; provided, however, that no adjustment of the conversion rate shall
        be made which in the opinion of the accountant or firm of accountants
        giving the aforesaid opinion would result in a decrease of the
        conversion rate to less than the then basic conversion rate, except as
        otherwise provided in subparagraph (d) of this Paragraph (6).
 
             (g) Anything in this Paragraph (6) to the contrary notwithstanding,
        the corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the
        conversion rate in any case in which the amount by which such conversion
        rate would be increased or decreased in accordance with the foregoing
        provisions of this Paragraph (6) would be less than one one-hundredth of
        a share of Common Stock but in such case any adjustment that would
        otherwise be required then to be made shall be carried forward and made
        at the time and together with the next subsequent adjustment which,
        together with any and all such adjustments so carried forward, shall
        amount to one one-hundredth of a share of Common Stock.
 
             (h) The corporation shall give written notice of each adjustment in
        the conversion rate to each holder of record of the First Series at the
        address of each such holder as shown on the books of the corporation at
        the time of payment of the regular cash dividend on the First Series
        occurring next after such adjustment.
 
             Whenever the corporation shall make any adjustment in the
        conversion rate as herein provided, the corporation shall forthwith file
        with the Transfer Agents of the Common Stock in the Borough of
        Manhattan, The City of New York, New York and in the City of Pittsburgh,
        Pennsylvania, a statement, signed by the President or a Vice President
        of the corporation and by its Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer,
        showing in detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the conversion
        rate that will be effective after such adjustment.
 
             In case at any time:
 
                (1) the corporation shall pay any dividend payable in shares of
             its Common Stock upon its Common Stock or make any distribution
             (other than a quarterly cash dividend in an amount per share not in
             excess of the amount per share of the last preceding quarterly cash
             dividend) to the holders of its Common Stock;
 
                (2) the corporation shall offer for subscription pro rata to the
             holders of its Common Stock any additional shares of stock of any
             class or other rights;
 
                (3) there shall be any capital reorganization or
             reclassification of the capital stock of the corporation or
             consolidation or merger of the corporation with, or sale of all or
             substantially all of its assets to, another corporation; or
 
                (4) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
             liquidation or winding up of the corporation;
 
                                      9
<PAGE>

             then, in any one or more of said cases, the corporation shall give
             written notice, by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed
             to each holder of record of the First Series at the address of
             each such holder as shown on the books of the corporation, of the
             date on which (a) the books of the corporation shall close or a
             record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or
             subscription rights or (b) such reorganization, reclassification,
             consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding
             up shall take place, as the case may be. Such notice shall also
             specify the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record
             shall participate in such dividend, distribution or subscription
             rights, or shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for
             securities or other property deliverable upon such
             reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
             dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, as the case may be. Such
             written notice shall be given at least 21 days prior to the action
             in question and not less than 21 days prior to the record date or
             the date on which the corporation's transfer books are closed
             with respect thereto.
 
             No fraction of share of Common Stock shall be issued upon
        conversion of shares of the First Series but, in lieu thereof the
        corporation shall pay to the holder of such shares so converted who
        would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share, a cash adjustment in
        respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the
        market value of a full share of Common Stock on the date immediately
        preceding the date upon which any such shares are surrendered for
        conversion. The market value of a share of Common Stock shall be
        computed on the basis of the average of the bid and asked quotations in
        the over-the-counter market on the last business day before the
        conversion date or, if the Common Stock shall at the time be dealt in on
        a securities exchange, shall be the last recorded sale price of a share
        of Common Stock on such exchange on the last business day preceding the
        conversion date or, if there be no such last recorded sale price, the
        last quoted bid price on such exchange at the close of trading on such
        day.
 
             The corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out
        of its authorized but unissued Common Stock the full number of shares of
        Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all shares of the First
        Series from time to time outstanding.
 
             The corporation will pay any and all taxes that may be payable in
        respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion
        of shares of the First Series pursuant hereto. The corporation shall
        not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect
        of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common
        Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of the First Series
        so converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be
        made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the
        corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
        satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid.
 
                            SECTION II. COMMON STOCK
 
     This Section II sets forth the powers, preferences and rights and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions in respect to the Common Stock of
the corporation.
 
Subsection A. Equal Rights.
 
     Each share of Common Stock issued or to be issued under the provisions of
this Article Fifth shall be equal in all respects one with the other, and no
dividend shall be paid on any shares of Common Stock unless the same dividend is
paid on all shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of such payment, and
there shall be no distinction or difference between any share of Common Stock,
or any rights appertaining thereto, and any other share of Common Stock.
 
Subsection B. Other Rights.
 
     Except for and subject to those rights expressly granted in Section I of
this Article Fifth to the holders of the Third Cumulative Preferred Stock, or
except as may be provided by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the
holders of the Common Stock shall have exclusively all other rights of
stockholders
                                       10
<PAGE>
including but not by way of limitation: (a) exclusive voting power for all
purposes and exclusive rights to all notices of meetings or of any action to be
taken by the corporation or by its stockholders, (b) the right to receive
dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of assets lawfully
available therefor, and (c) in the event of any distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation or otherwise, the
right to receive ratably and equally all of the assets and funds of the
corporation remaining after the payment to the holders of other classes of stock
of the corporation of the specific amounts which they are entitled to receive
upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation as
hereinbefore provided in Section I of this Article Fifth.
 
Subsection C. Issuance of Common Stock.
 
     The Common Stock shall be issued from time to time and at such time and in
such manner and for such consideration, whether in cash or property or
otherwise, as the Board of Directors shall in their absolute discretion by a
duly adopted resolution provide.
 
                         SECTION III. PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS
 
     No holder of stock of the corporation of any class, whether now or
hereafter outstanding, shall be entitled or have any right, as such holder, to
subscribe for or to purchase any part of (i) any shares of any class whatsoever
which the corporation may hereafter issue or sell or (ii) any obligations or
securities which the corporation may hereafter issue or sell convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of the corporation of any class or (iii) any
warrants which the corporation may hereafter issue or sell that shall confer
upon the holder or owner thereof the right to subscribe for or purchase from the
corporation any of its shares of any class. The provisions of this Section III
shall be effective to eliminate and deny any preemptive right which may exist or
may have existed in respect of any outstanding shares.
 
                      SECTION IV. CUMULATIVE VOTING RIGHTS
 
     No shareholder shall in any election of directors have any right to
cumulate his votes and cast them for one candidate or distribute them among two
or more candidates.
 
     6. Section I. Limitation of Director Liability. To the fullest extent that
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as in effect on January 27, 1987 or as
thereafter amended, permit elimination of limitation of the liability of
directors, no Director of the corporation shall be personally liable for
monetary damages as such for any action taken, or any failure to take any
action, as a Director. This Section I shall not apply to any action filed prior
to January 27, 1987, nor to any breach of performance of duty or any failure of
performance of duty by any Director occurring prior to January 27, 1987. The
provisions of this Section I shall be deemed to be a contract with each Director
of the corporation who serves as such at any time while such provisions are in
effect, and each such Director shall be deemed to be serving as such in reliance
on the provisions of this Section I. This Section I shall not be amended,
altered or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80%
of the voting power (without consideration of the rights of any class of stock
to elect directors by a separate class vote) of the then outstanding shares of
capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote in an annual election of
Directors, voting together and not as separate classes, unless such amendment,
alteration or repeal is first recommended and approved by a majority of the
entire Board of Directors in which case only a majority shareholder vote shall
be required. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact
that no vote is required, or that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law
or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise. Any
amendment to, alteration or repeal of this Section I which has the effect of
increasing Director liability shall operate prospectively only and shall not
have any effect with respect to any action taken, or any failure to act, by a
Director prior thereto.
 
     Section II. Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Others. Except as
prohibited by law, the corporation may indemnify any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(including, without limitation, any
                                       11
<PAGE>
employee benefit plan) and may take such steps as may be deemed appropriate by
the Board of Directors, including purchasing and maintaining insurance, entering
into contracts (including, without limitation, contracts or indemnification
between the corporation and its directors, officers or employees), creating a
trust fund, granting security interests or using other means (including, without
limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amount as may be
necessary to effect such indemnification. This Section II shall apply to any
action taken, or any failure to take any action, on or after January 27, 1987.
This Section II shall not be amended, altered or repealed without the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power (without
consideration of the rights of any class of stock to elect directors by a
separate class) of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
corporation entitled to vote in an annual election of Directors, voting together
and not as separate classes, unless such amendment, alteration or repeal is
first recommended and approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors in
which case only a majority shareholder vote shall be required. Such affirmative
vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote is required, or
that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement with any
national securities exchange or otherwise. Any amendment to, alteration or
repeal of this Section II which has the effect of limiting the authority of the
corporation to indemnify persons under this Section II shall operate
prospectively only and shall not limit in any way any indemnification provided
pursuant to this Section II with respect to any action taken, or failure to act,
occurring prior thereto.
 
     7.1 A higher than majority shareholder vote for certain Business
Combinations shall be required as follows (all capitalized terms being used as
subsequently defined herein):
 
         (a) In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or the
     Articles of Incorporation, and except as otherwise expressly provided in
     Section 7.2 of this Article Seventh:
 
             (1) any merger or consolidation of the corporation or any
         Subsidiary with (A) any Interested Shareholder or with (B) any other
         corporation (whether or not itself an Interested Shareholder) which is,
         or after such merger or consolidation would be, an Affiliate or
         Associate of an Interested Shareholder;
 
             (2) any sale, lease, exchange, loan, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
         other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to
         or with any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of any
         Interested Shareholder of any assets of the corporation or any
         Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value of $15,000,000 or
         more;
 
             (3) the issuance or sale by the corporation or any Subsidiary (in
         one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities of the
         corporation or any Subsidiary to any Interested Shareholder or any
         Affiliate or Associate of any Interested Shareholder in exchange for
         cash, securities or other consideration (or a combination thereof)
         having an aggregate Fair Market Value of $15,000,000 or more;
 
             (4) the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or
         dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of any
         Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of any Interested
         Shareholder; or
 
             (5) any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock
         split), or recapitalization of the corporation, or any merger or
         consolidation of the corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any
         other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving
         any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of any
         Interested Shareholder) which has the effect, directly or indirectly,
         of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any
         class of equity securities or securities convertible into equity
         securities of the corporation or any Subsidiary which is directly or
         indirectly owned by any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or
         Associate of any Interested Shareholder;
 
     shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the
     voting power (without consideration of the rights of any class of stock to
     elect directors by a separate class vote) of the then outstanding shares of
     capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote in an annual election of
     directors (the "Voting
                                       12
<PAGE>
     Stock"), voting together and not as separate classes. Such affirmative vote
     shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote is required, or
     that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement with
     any national securities exchange or otherwise.
 
          (b) the term "Business Combination" as used in this Article Seventh
     shall mean any transaction which is referred to in any one or more of
     clauses (1) through (5) of paragraph (a) of Section 7.1 of this Article
     Seventh.
 
     7.2 The provisions of Section 7.1 of this Article Seventh shall not be
applicable to any Business Combination, and such Business Combination shall
require only such affirmative vote (if any) as is required by law or any other
provision of the Articles of Incorporation if the conditions specified in either
of the following paragraphs (a) or (b) are met:
 
         (a) The Business Combination shall have been approved by a majority of
     the Continuing Directors; or
 
         (b) All of the following six conditions shall have been met:
 
             (1) The transaction constituting the Business Combination shall
         provide for a consideration to be received by holders of Common Stock
         in exchange for their stock, and the aggregate amount of the cash and
         the Fair Market Value as of the date of the consummation of the
         Business Combination of consideration other than cash to be received
         per share by holders of Common Stock in such Business Combination
         shall be at least equal to the highest of the following:
 
                (A) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any
             brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees)
             paid in order to acquire any shares of Common Stock beneficially
             owned by the Interested Shareholder which were acquired (i) within
             the two-year period immediately prior to the first public
             announcement of the proposed Business Combination (the
             "Announcement Date") or (ii) in the transaction in which it became
             an Interested Shareholder, whichever is higher;
 
                (B) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the
             Announcement Date or on the date on which the Interested
             Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder (the "Determination
             Date"), whichever is higher; and
 
                (C) (if applicable) the price per share equal to the Fair Market
             Value per share of Common Stock determined pursuant to clause (B)
             immediately preceding, multiplied by the ratio of (i) the highest
             per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer
             taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid in order to acquire any
             shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Interested
             Shareholder which were acquired within the two-year period
             immediately prior to the Announcement Date to (ii) the Fair Market
             Value per share of Common Stock on the first day in such two-year
             period on which the Interested Shareholder beneficially owned any
             shares of Common Stock.
 
             All per share prices shall be adjusted to reflect any intervening
        stock splits, stock dividends and reverse stock splits.
 
             (2) If the transaction constituting the Business Combination shall
        also provide for a consideration to be received by holders of any class
        of outstanding Voting Stock (other than Common Stock and other than
        Institutional Voting Stock) in exchange for their stock, the aggregate
        amount of the cash and the Fair Market Value as of the date of the
        consummation of the Business Combination of consideration other than
        cash to be received per share by holders of Shares of such Voting Stock
        shall be at least equal to the highest of the following (it being
        intended that the requirements of this clause (b) (2) shall be required
        to be met with respect to every class of outstanding Voting Stock (other
        than Institutional Voting Stock), whether or not the Interested
        Shareholder beneficially owns any shares of a particular class of Voting
        Stock):
 
                                       13
<PAGE>
                (A) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any
           brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees)
           paid in order to acquire any shares of such class of Voting Stock
           beneficially owned by the Interested Shareholder which were acquired
           (i) within the two-year period immediately prior to the Announcement
           Date or (ii) in the transaction in which it became an Interested
           Shareholder, whichever is higher;
 
                (B) (if applicable) the highest preferential amount per share to
           which the holders of shares of such class of Voting Stock are
           entitled in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
           dissolution or winding up of the corporation;
 
                (C) the Fair Market Value per share of such class of Voting
           Stock on the Announcement Date or on the Determination Date,
           whichever is higher; and
 
                (D) (if applicable) the price per share equal to the Fair Market
           Value per share of such class of Voting Stock determined pursuant to
           clause (C) immediately preceding, multiplied by the ratio of (i) the
           highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions,
           transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid in order to acquire
           any shares of such class of Voting Stock beneficially owned by the
           Interested Shareholder which were acquired within the two-year period
           immediately prior to the Announcement Date to (ii) the Fair Market
           Value per share of such class of Voting Stock on the first day in
           such two-year period on which the Interested Shareholder beneficially
           owned any shares of such class of Voting Stock.
 
             All per share prices shall be adjusted for intervening stock
        splits, stock dividends and reverse stock splits.
 
             (3) The consideration to be received by holders of a particular
        class of outstanding Voting Stock (including Common Stock) shall be in
        cash or in the same form as was previously paid in order to acquire
        shares of such class of Voting Stock which are beneficially owned by the
        Interested Shareholder. If the Interested Shareholder beneficially owns
        shares of any class of Voting Stock which were acquired with varying
        forms of consideration, the form of consideration to be received by
        holders of such class of Voting Stock shall be either cash or the form
        used to acquire the largest number of shares of such class of Voting
        Stock beneficially owned by it.
 
             (4) After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested
        Shareholder and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination:
        (A) except as approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors, there
        shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular date
        therefor any full quarterly dividends (whether or not cumulative) on any
        outstanding preferred stock; (B) there shall have been (i) no reduction
        in the annual rate of dividends paid on the Common Stock (except as
        necessary to reflect any subdivision of the Common Stock) except as
        approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors, and (ii) an increase
        in such annual rate of dividends (as necessary to prevent any such
        reduction) in the event of any reclassification (including any reverse
        stock split), recapitalization, reorganization or any similar
        transaction which has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding
        shares of the common Stock, unless the failure so to increase such
        annual rate is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; and
        (C) such Interested Shareholder shall not have become the beneficial
        owner of any shares of Voting Stock except as part of the transaction in
        which it became an Interested Shareholder.
 
             (5) After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested
        Shareholder, such Interested Shareholder shall not have received the
        benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a
        shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other
        financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided
        by the corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with
        such Business Combination or otherwise.
 
             (6) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed
        Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder
        (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations)
        shall be mailed to all shareholders of the corporation at least 30 days
        prior to the consummation of such
                                       14
<PAGE>
        Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement
        is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions).
 
     7.3 For the purposes of this Article Seventh:
 
          (a) A "person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation or other
     entity.
 
          (b) "Interested Shareholder" at any particular time shall mean any

H. J. Heinz Company
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

Article 1. Establishment and Purposes

     1.1 Establishment. H. J. Heinz Company (the "Company"), hereby
establishes, effective as of June 8, 1994 (the "Effective Date"), a deferred
compensation plan for key employees as described herein, which shall be known
as the "H. J. Heinz Company Executive Deferred Compensation Plan" (the "Plan").

     1.2 Purpose. The primary Purpose of the Plan is to provide certain key
employees of the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates with the opportunity
to voluntarily defer a portion of their compensation, subject to the terms of
the Plan. By adopting the Plan, the Company desires to enhance its ability to
attract and retain employees of outstanding competence.

Article 2. Administration

     2.1 The Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the Management
Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
or any other successor Committee appointed by the Board (the "Committee"). The
members of the Committee shall be appointed by, and shall serve at the
discretion of, the Board.

     2.2 Authority of the Committee. Except as limited by law or by the
Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, and subject to the provisions
herein, the Committee shall have authority to select eligible employees of the
Company for participation in the Plan; determine the terms and conditions of
each employee's participation in the Plan; interpret the Plan; establish,
amend, or waive rules and regulations for the Plan's administration; and,
subject to Article 8 herein, amend the terms and conditions of the Plan and any
agreement entered into under the Plan. Further, the Committee shall make all
other determinations which may be necessary or advisable for the administration
of the Plan. As permitted by law, the Committee may delegate any of its
authority granted under the Plan to such other person or entity it deems
appropriate, including, but not limited to, senior management of the Company.

     2.3 Guidelines. Subject to the provisions herein, the Committee may adopt
written guidelines for the implementation and administration of the Plan.

     2.4 Decisions Binding. All determinations and decisions of the Committee
arising under the Plan shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all
parties.

Article 3. Eligibility and Participation

     3.1 Eligibility. Subject to Section 3.2, Employees eligible to be selected
to participate in the Plan in any fiscal year of the Company (hereinafter, a
"Year") include all full-time, salaried employees of the Company, its
subsidiaries, and affiliates who are key employees, as determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion.

     3.2 Limitation on Eligibility. It is the intent of the Company that the
Plan qualify for treatment as a "top hat" plan under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time, or any successor Act
thereto ("ERISA"). Accordingly, to the extent required by ERISA to obtain such
"top hat" treatment, eligibility shall be extended only to those executives who
comprise a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Further,
the Committee may place such additional limitations on eligibility as it deems
necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.

     3.3 Participation. Participation in the Plan shall be determined annually
by the Committee based upon the criteria set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.2
herein. An employee who is chosen to participate in the Plan in any Year (a
"Participant") shall be so notified in writing.

     In the event a Participant selected to participate in the Plan no longer
meets the criteria for participation, such Participant shall become an inactive
Participant, retaining all the rights described under the Plan, except the
right to make any further deferrals, until such time that the Participant again
becomes an active Participant.

     3.4 Partial Year Eligibility. In the event that an employee first becomes
eligible to participate in the Plan during a Year, such employee shall, within
thirty (30) calendar days of becoming eligible, be notified by the Company of
his or her eligibility to participate, and the Company shall provide each such
employee with an "Election to Defer Form," which must be completed by the
employee as provided in Section 4.2 herein; provided, however, that such
employee may only make an election to defer with respect to that portion of his
or her compensation, as defined herein, for such Year which is to be earned
after the filing of the deferral election.

     3.5 No Right to Participate. No employee shall have the right to be
selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected for any given Year, to
be selected again as a Participant for any other Year.

Article 4. Deferral Opportunity

     4.1 Amount Which May Be Deferred. A Participant may elect to defer, in any
Year, up to one hundred percent (100%) of eligible components of Compensation,
including but not limited to Salary, Bonus, and Long-Term Awards, all as
defined herein; provided, however, that the Committee shall have sole
discretion to designate which components of Compensation are eligible for
deferral elections under the Plan in any given Year. In addition, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, designate the minimum amount or increments of any
single eligible component of Compensation which may be deferred in any Year or
establish any other limitations as it deems appropriate in any Year.

     The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Plan:
   
     (a) "Bonus" means any incentive award based on an assessment of
         performance, payable by the Company to a Participant with respect to
         the Participant's services during a Year, including but not limited to
         amounts awarded under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan;
         provided, however, that for purposes of the Plan, "Bonus" shall be
         deemed earned only upon award by the Company and shall not include
         incentive awards which relate to a period exceeding one (1) Year.
      
     (b) "Compensation" means the gross Salary, Bonus, Long-Term Awards,
         and other payments eligible for deferral under the Plan, which are
         payable to a Participant with respect to services performed during a
         Year.
      
     (c) "Long-Term Award" means any cash award payable to a Participant
         pursuant to a Company program which establishes incentive award
         opportunities which are contingent upon performance which is measured
         over periods greater than one (1) Year.
      
     (d) "Salary" means all regular, basic wages, before reduction for amounts
         deferred pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company,
         payable in cash to a Participant for services to be rendered during
         the Year, exclusive of any Bonus, Long-Term Awards, other special
         fees, awards, or incentive compensation, allowances, or amounts
         designated by the Company as payment toward or reimbursement of
         expenses.
      
     4.2 Deferral Election. Participants shall make their elections to defer
Compensation under the Plan at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
beginning of each Year, or not later than thirty (30) calendar days following
notification of eligibility to participate for a partial Year. All deferral
elections shall be irrevocable, and shall be made on an "Election to Defer
Form," as described herein.
 
 
 
                                      3
<PAGE>
 
     Participants shall make the following irrevocable elections on each
"Election to Defer Form":

     (a) The amount to be deferred with respect to each eligible component of
         Compensation for the Year;
      
     (b) The length of the deferral period with respect to each eligible
         component of Compensation, pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3
         herein; and
      
     (c) The form of payment to be made to the Participant at the end of the
         deferral period(s), pursuant to the terms of Section 4.4 herein.
      
     Notwithstanding the amounts requested to be deferred pursuant to
Subparagraph (a) above, the limits on deferrals set forth in Section 4.1 herein
shall apply to the requested deferrals each Year.

     4.3 Length of Deferral. The deferral periods elected by each Participant
with respect to deferrals of Compensation for any Year shall be at least equal
to one (1) year following the end of the Year in which the Compensation is
earned, and shall be no greater than the date of retirement or other
termination of employment, whichever is earlier. However, notwithstanding the
deferral periods elected by a Participant, payment of deferred amounts and
accumulated interest thereon shall be made to the Participant in a single lump
sum in the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by
reason of death or total disability, as defined in the Company's Long-Term
Disability Plan, at any time prior to full payment of deferred amounts and
interest thereon. Such payment following employment termination shall be made
in cash, within thirty (30) calendar days after the termination of the
Participant's employment, or as soon thereafter as practicable.

     4.4 Payment of Deferred Amounts. Participants shall be entitled to elect
to receive payment of deferred amounts, together with interest earned thereon,
at the end of the deferral period in a single lump-sum cash payment, by means
of installments, or in such other format approved by the Committee.

     (a) Lump-Sum Payment. Such payment shall be made in cash within
         thirty (30) calendar days of the date specified by the Participant as
         the date for payment of deferred Compensation, as described in
         Sections 4.2 and 4.3 herein, or as soon thereafter as practicable.
 
 
 
                                      4
<PAGE>
 
     (b) Installment Payments. Participants may elect payout in installments,
         with a minimum number of installments of two (2), and a maximum
         of ten (10). The initial payment shall be made in cash within thirty
         (30) calendar days after the commencement date selected by the
         Participant pursuant to Sections 4.2 and 4.3 herein, or as soon
         thereafter as practicable. The remaining installment payments shall be
         made in cash each year thereafter, until the Participant's entire
         deferred compensation account has been paid. Interest shall accrue on
         the deferred amounts in the Participant's deferred compensation
         account, as provided in Section 5.2 of this Plan. The amount of each
         installment payment shall be equal to the balance remaining in the
         Participant's deferred compensation account immediately prior to
         each such payment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
         is one (1), and the denominator of which is the number of installment
         payments remaining.
         
         In the event a Participant's employment with the Company is
         terminated by reason of death or total disability at a time when there
         is a balance in the Participant's deferred compensation account, the
         entire balance shall be paid out to the Participant, as set forth in
         Section 4.3 herein.
         
     (c) Alternative Payment Schedule. A participant may submit an
         alternate payment schedule to the Committee for approval; provided,
         however, that no such alternate payment schedule shall be permitted
         unless approved by the Committee.
         
     4.5 Financial Hardship. The Committee shall have the authority to alter
the timing or manner of payment of deferred amounts in the event that the
Participant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Committee, severe financial
hardship. In such event, the Committee may, in its sole discretion:
  
     (a) Authorize the cessation of deferrals by such Participant under the
         Plan; or
         
     (b) Provide that all or a portion of the amount previously deferred
         by the Participant shall immediately be paid in a lump-sum cash
         payment; or
         
     (c) Provide that all or a portion of the installments payable over a period
         of time shall immediately be paid in a lump-sum cash payment; or
         
     (d) Provide for such other installment payment schedule as deemed
         appropriate by the Committee under the circumstances.


                                      5
<PAGE>
 
     For purposes of this Section 4.5, "severe financial hardship" shall be
determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, in accordance with all
applicable laws. The Committee's's decision with respect to the severity of
financial hardship and the manner in which, if at all, the Participant's future
deferral opportunities shall be ceased, and/or the manner in which, if at all,
the payment of deferred amounts to the Participant shall be altered or
modified, shall be final, conclusive, and not subject to appeal. The
Participant's account will be credited with earnings in accordance with the
Plan up to the date of distribution.

Article 5. Deferred Compensation Accounts

     5.1 Participants' Accounts. The Company shall establish and maintain an
individual bookkeeping account for deferrals made by each Participant under
Article 4 herein. Each account shall be credited as of the date the amount
deferred otherwise would have become due and payable to the Participant.

     5.2 Interest on Deferred Amounts. Compensation deferred under Article 4
shall accrue interest at the rate selected by the Committee. Each
Participant's deferred compensation account shall be credited on the last day
of each calendar quarter, with interest computed on the average balance in the
account during such quarter.

     Interest earned on deferred amounts shall be paid out to Participants at
the same time and in the same manner as the underlying deferred amounts.

     5.3 Charges Against Accounts. There shall be charged against each
Participant's deferred compensation account any payments made to the
Participant or to his or her beneficiary.

Article 6. Rights of Participants

     6.1 Contractual Obligation. The Plan shall create a contractual obligation
on the part of the Company to make payments from the Participants' accounts
when due. Payment of account balances shall be made out of the general funds of
the Company.

     6.2 Unsecured Interest. No Participant or party claiming an interest in
amounts deferred by a Participant, including any interest thereon, shall have
any interest whatsoever in any specific asset of the Company. To the extent
that any party acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan, such right
shall be equivalent to that of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.





                                      6
<PAGE>
 
     The Company may, but shall not be required to, establish one or more
trusts, with such trustee as the Committee may approve, for the purpose of
providing for the payment of deferred amounts. Such trust or trusts may be
irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the
Company's general creditors. To the extent any amounts deferred under the Plan
are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further
obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such deferred
amounts shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.

     6.3 Employment. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with nor limit, in any
way, the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment at any
time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of
the Company.

Article 7. Withholding of Taxes

     The Company shall have the right to require Participants to remit to the
Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any withholding tax requirements or
to deduct from all payments made pursuant to the Plan amounts sufficient to
satisfy withholding tax requirements.

Article 8. Amendment and Termination

     The Company hereby reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate
the Plan at any time by action of the Committee. Except as described below in
this Article 8, no such amendment or termination shall in any material manner
adversely affect any Participant's rights to amounts previously deferred
hereunder, or interest earned thereon, without the consent of the Participant.

     The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan which is maintained primarily
to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of "management or
highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 301, and 401
of ERISA, and to therefore be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3, and 4
of Title I of ERISA. Accordingly, the Board may terminate the Plan and commence
termination payout for all or certain Participants, or remove certain employees
as Participants, if it is determined by the United States Department of Labor
or a court of competent jurisdiction that the Plan constitutes an employee
pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA which is not
so exempt. If payout is commenced pursuant to the operation of this Article 8,
the payment of such amounts shall be made in the manner selected by each
Participant under Section 4.4 herein as applicable.
 
 
 
                                      7
<PAGE>
 
Article 9. Miscellaneous

     9.1 Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the
Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or
sent by registered or certified mail to the Vice President--Organization
Development and Administration of the Company. Notice to the Vice
President--Organization Development and Administration of the Company, if
mailed, shall be addressed to the principal executive offices of the Company.
Notice mailed to a Participant shall be at such address as is given in the
records of the Company. Notices shall be deemed given as of the date of
delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark
on the receipt for registration or certification.

     9.2 Nontransferability. Participants' rights to deferred amounts,

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      H.J. HEINZ COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
.............................................................................

                         In 1994, the company continued to restructure
                         its portfolio of businesses and operations to be
                         better positioned for future profit growth. During
                         the year, the company acquired the Moore's and Domani
                         product lines and divested businesses that did not
                         fit with the company's long-term growth objectives.
                              The company implemented several productivity
                         improvement and cost reduction initiatives in 1994
                         for which a $192.3 million pretax charge had been
                         recorded in 1993. The major components of the 1993
                         restructuring plan related to employee severance and
                         relocation costs ($99 million) and facilities
                         consolidation and closure costs ($73 million).
                         Specifically, the company reduced headcount at its
                         Australian operations; closed a pet food plant in
                         Pascagoula, Mississippi; downsized and consolidated
                         StarKist Seafood headquarters functions with those of
                         Heinz Pet Products in Newport, Kentucky; realigned
                         production at Ore-Ida's Ontario, Oregon factory;
                         downsized the administration of Weight Watchers
                         International meeting operations; downsized the
                         administrative functions of the Italian operations;
                         reduced manufacturing headcount and reorganized the
                         administrative functions in the United Kingdom;
                         consolidated domestic sales service functions into
                         the Heinz Service Company; and realigned production
                         between Canada and the United States. Remaining
                         restructuring initiatives provided for in 1993 in
                         both the United States and foreign locations will be
                         completed in 1995. At the time the restructuring
                         charges were recorded, it was anticipated that the
                         company would reduce headcount by 3,000 and realize
                         cost savings of approximately $100 million annually.
                         The company expects to achieve the original
                         projections of cost savings and headcount reductions
                         upon completion of the remaining projects.
                              Fiscal 1994 was a disappointing year for the
                         Weight Watchers businesses (meetings and food) which
                         were affected by the Los Angeles earthquake, one of
                         the worst winters in many years in the U.S. and
                         declining meeting attendance in the U.S. of 15%, all
                         of which have affected the entire weight-loss
                         industry. One of the company's primary objectives is
                         to stabilize and rebuild domestic attendance volumes
                         in order to improve the overall profitability of the
                         Weight Watchers businesses, which currently represent
                         less than 10% of sales.
                              Several of the company's domestic operations
                         were affected by the company's trade "de-loading"
                         strategy implemented in 1994, whereby shipments to
                         meet the trade's promotional period sales activity
                         were more closely aligned with the consumer demand
                         for certain grocery products. This strategy had a
                         negative impact on the company's sales volume.
                              In 1994, the strengthening dollar against most
                         currencies had a negative impact on the company's
                         results from overseas operations. Fluctuating
                         exchange rates adversely impacted the company's
                         results during the first three quarters of 1994,
                         mainly due to the depreciation of the United Kingdom
                         pound sterling and Italian lira associated with the
                         breakdown of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the
                         European Monetary System experienced in Fiscal 1993.
                         As the company moved beyond the twelve-month
                         anniversary of the breakdown of the ERM, the adverse
                         impact of foreign exchange comparisons on the results
                         of operations has diminished. The company does not
                         anticipate exchange rate fluctuations to have a
                         significant impact on the results of operations in
                         the near future.
..............................................................................
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:   1994 versus 1993: Sales for 1994 decreased $56.6
                         million, or 0.8%, to $7.05 billion from $7.10 billion
                         in 1993. The sales decrease was due to the effects of
                         the stronger U.S. dollar against most foreign
                         currencies and to divestitures, partially offset by
                         price increases and acquisitions. Volume remained
                         flat.
                              For the third year in a row, unfavorable foreign
                         currency translation rates adversely impacted sales.
                         The negative sales impact of foreign currency
                         translation was $278.6 million, or 3.9%, the largest
                         dollar decline in the company's history. This
                         resulted principally from an unprecedented decline of
                         the United Kingdom pound sterling and Italian lira
                         against the U.S. dollar as a result of these two
                         countries leaving the European Monetary System in
                         Fiscal 1993.
                              Prices increased $134.1 million in 1994, or
                         1.9%, principally in the U.S. Increases in StarKist
                         tuna, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and Heinz grocery
                         ketchup were partially offset by declines in pet
                         food. Overseas, price increases occurred in several
                         countries,

                         notably Italy, Zimbabwe and Venezuela.
                              Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased
                         sales $89.1 million, or 1.3%. Acquisitions included
                         the 1994 purchase of the Moore's and Domani product
                         lines (coated frozen foods and Italian frozen pastas)
                         from The Clorox Company of Oakland, California; the
                         purchases of Wattie's Limited of New Zealand in
                         October 1992; and several domestic Weight Watchers
                         franchises in 1993. Divestitures included the
                         confectionery business of Heinz Italia, the Near East
                         specialty rice business and other smaller businesses,
                         including the Chico-San rice cake business.
                              Volume was flat year-on-year; increases at
                         foreign operations were offset by decreases at
                         domestic operations. Foreign volume increases were
                         noted in baby food, sauces and pastes and Heinz
                         beans. Foreign volume declines occurred in condiments
                         and soups. Domestically, volume decreases were noted
                         in the Weight Watchers businesses (meetings and
                         food), Ore-Ida grocery frozen potatoes, Heinz grocery
                         ketchup, StarKist tuna and Heinz baby food; the
                         volume decrease was due in part to the strategy to
                         "de-load" the trade's inventories implemented in
                         1994. Domestic volume increases occurred in Ore-Ida
                         foodservice potatoes, pet food, Heinz foodservice
                         ketchup and single-serve condiments.
                              Gross profit increased $92.2 million in 1994 to
                         $2.66 billion from $2.57 billion. Excluding the
                         effect of the 1993 restructuring charges of $143.5
                         million, gross profit declined $51.3 million due
                         primarily to the sales decline in the Weight Watchers
                         businesses (meetings and food), the trade "de-
                         loading" strategy and foreign exchange. This was
                         partially offset by the effects of acquisition and
                         divestiture activities, reduced trade promotions,
                         lower costs associated with the restructuring
                         projects and operating improvements resulting from
                         the implementation of the restructuring strategy. The
                         ratio of gross profit to sales increased to 37.8%
                         from 36.2%. Excluding the effect of the restructuring
                         charges, the 1993 gross profit ratio was 38.2%.
                              Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
                         expenses increased $11.7 million to $1.72 billion
                         from $1.71 billion, primarily due to increased
                         consumer promotions as well as incremental selling
                         and distribution expenses resulting from the full-
                         year effect of the Wattie's Limited acquisition,
                         partially offset by a decrease in general and
                         administrative expenses. The decline in general and
                         administrative expenses was due to restructuring
                         charges recorded in 1993, lower costs associated with
                         the restructuring projects and operating improvements
                         resulting from the implementation of the
                         restructuring strategy.
                              Operating income increased $207.5 million in
                         1994 to $1.07 billion from $860.9 million in 1993.
                         The increase in operating income was primarily due to
                         the inclusion of the gains on the sale of the
                         confectionery business of Heinz Italia and the sale
                         of the Near East specialty rice business in 1994
                         ($127.0 million) and to the restructuring charges
                         recorded in 1993 ($192.3 million). Adjusting for
                         these items, operating income declined $111.8
                         million, or 10.6% (declined to 13.4% of sales from
                         14.8% of sales). This decline was principally due to
                         the decline in gross profit and increase in SG&A
                         expenses, as discussed above.
                              Non-operating expenses totaled $146.0 million in
                         1994 compared to $145.1 million in 1993. Interest
                         income increased $7.3 million from $29.5 million in
                         1993 to $36.8 million in 1994 due to higher invested
                         cash generated from recent divestitures. Interest
                         expense increased $2.8 million to $149.2 million in
                         1994 from $146.5 million in 1993, primarily the
                         result of the additional interest associated with the
                         $750 million of debentures issued in the second and
                         third quarters of 1993, partially offset by lower
                         average short-term borrowings. Offsetting this
                         decrease in net interest were lower foreign
                         government grants in 1994.
                              The effective tax rate was 34.6% in 1994 and
                         26.0% in 1993. Both years' effective tax rates
                         reflect tax benefits from overseas operations ($57.3
                         million in 1994 and $41.8 million in 1993). The 1993
                         tax rate also benefited from the recognition of
                         foreign tax credits associated with the company's
                         overseas dividend strategy ($40.0 million). (See Note
                         5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
                              Net income increased $206.6 million, or 52.1%,
                         to $602.9 million from $396.3 million in the prior
                         year and net income per share increased to $2.35 from
                         $1.53. The increase in net income per share of 53.6%
                         in 1994, versus the 52.1% increase in net income,
                         reflected the favorable benefit of the company's
                         share repurchase plan. The 1994 results included
                         gains of $0.24 per share from the sale of the
                         confectionery business of Heinz Italia and the sale
                         of the Near East specialty rice business. In
                         addition, 1994
 
                                                                              33

                         and 1993 benefited from lower effective tax rates.
                         The 1993 results included the effect of the adoption
                         of FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
                         Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
                         ($0.51 per share) and restructuring charges ($0.45
                         per share).
                              The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for
                         1994 remained relatively consistent on a line-by-line
                         basis throughout the Consolidated Statement of
                         Income.

                         1993 versus 1992: Sales for 1993 increased $521.5
                         million, or 7.9%, to $7.10 billion. The sales
                         increase came primarily from volume and acquisitions,
                         partially offset by the effects of the stronger U.S.
                         dollar against most foreign currencies.
                              Volume increased 5.7%, or $376.6 million, and
                         reflected sustained marketing support and
                         restructuring initiatives that occurred in 1992.
                         Approximately 70% of the volume increase came from
                         domestic operations, with gains in: StarKist tuna;
                         Weight Watchers brand entrees, desserts and specialty
                         foods; 9-Lives cat food; Ore-Ida frozen potatoes;
                         coated frozen foods; various dog food; Chef Francisco
                         frozen soup; and Heinz foodservice ketchup.
                         Domestically, volume declines occurred in Weight
                         Watchers meeting operations, Heinz grocery ketchup
                         and Heinz baby food. Overseas, volume increases were
                         noted in baby food, Heinz ketchup and sauces and
                         pastes, with declines in Heinz soup and beans.
                              Acquisitions, net of divestitures, accounted for
                         $245.6 million, or 3.7%. Companies acquired during
                         1993 included Wattie's Limited (a producer of a broad
                         range of grocery products in New Zealand), Arimpex
                         (an Italian foodservice distribution company) and
                         several Weight Watchers franchises.
                              Unfavorable foreign currency translation rates
                         adversely impacted sales in 1993. Declines came
                         principally from the stronger U.S. dollar versus the
                         United Kingdom pound sterling, the Italian lira, the
                         Zimbabwean dollar, the Canadian dollar and the
                         Australian dollar. The net reduction in sales
                         attributable to foreign currency translation was
                         $120.7 million, or 1.8%.
                              Prices were flat year-on-year, with increases in
                         foreign prices offset by domestic declines. Increases
                         in baby food, soups, Weight Watchers meeting
                         operations and Weight Watchers brand desserts,
                         StarKist white meat tuna, edible oils, margarines and
                         soaps were offset by price declines in Ore-Ida frozen
                         potatoes, various pet foods, StarKist light meat
                         tuna, Weight Watchers brand frozen entrees, Heinz
                         beans and domestic Heinz ketchup.
                              The results of operations for 1993 and 1992
                         included the effect of the company's restructuring
                         strategy. A pretax charge of $192.3 million was
                         recorded in 1993, versus a charge of $88.3 million in
                         1992.
                              Gross profit increased $93.8 million in 1993 to
                         $2.57 billion from $2.48 billion, primarily as a
                         result of the increase in sales. The ratio of gross
                         profit to sales declined to 36.2% from 37.7%. The
                         decline in the gross profit ratio was principally the
                         result of increased restructuring charges associated
                         with consolidating and downsizing manufacturing
                         operations; the ratio was favorably impacted by
                         product mix, cost efficiencies realized at the
                         company's pet products operations and lower raw fish
                         prices. Excluding the 1993 restructuring charge, the
                         gross profit ratio would have been 38.2%.
                              In 1993, the company continued to invest heavily
                         in marketing its brands. Total marketing support,
                         which consists of trade and consumer promotions and
                         media, increased approximately 3% over the record
                         level established in 1992. Increased marketing
                         support was noted primarily in Ore-Ida frozen
                         potatoes and Weight Watchers brand entrees and at
                         Wattie's Limited in New Zealand.
                              SG&A expenses increased $117.9 million to $1.71
                         billion from $1.59 billion, primarily due to:
                         increased marketing; higher selling and distribution
                         expenses resulting from the increased sales volume;
                         and the curtailment gain of the domestic salaried
                         defined benefit pension plan of $38.8 million pretax
                         included in the 1992 results. (See Note 10 to the
                         Consolidated Financial Statements.) As a percentage
                         of sales, SG&A expenses declined to 24.1% in 1993
                         from 24.2% in 1992.
                              Operating income declined $245.6 million in
                         1993, to $860.9 million from $1.11 billion in 1992.
                         The decline in operating income year-on-year was
                         primarily due to higher restructuring charges
                         recorded in 1993 and the inclusion in 1992 of the
                         gain on the sale of The Hubinger Company. Operating
                         income as a percentage of sales declined to 12.1% in
                         1993 from 16.8% in 1992.

                              Non-operating expenses totaled $145.1 million in
                         1993, compared to $122.2 million in 1992. The
                         increase was primarily due to higher interest expense
                         resulting from higher average debt, offset partially
                         by lower average interest rates. The higher average
                         debt resulted from borrowings for acquisitions,
                         higher operating needs, capital expenditures and
                         purchases of treasury shares. Also contributing to
                         the increase in non-operating expenses was lower
                         interest income as a result of a reduction in the
                         company's Italian short-term investment portfolio.
                         Partially offsetting the increase were higher foreign
                         government grants.
                              The effective tax rate was 26.0% in 1993 and
                         35.2% in 1992. The 1993 effective rate of 26.0%
                         resulted from tax benefits overseas and the
                         recognition of foreign tax credits associated with
                         the company's overseas dividend strategy. The
                         effective rate on income from operations before the
                         current year charges for postretirement benefits and
                         restructuring was 29.0%. (See Note 5 to the
                         Consolidated Financial Statements.)
                              In 1993 the company adopted FAS No. 106,
                         "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
                         Other Than Pensions." The company elected to
                         immediately recognize the transition obligation. The
                         cumulative effect of adopting FAS No. 106 was $133.6
                         million ($0.51 per share) and the incremental current
                         year after-tax effect was $9.9 million ($0.04 per
                         share). (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
                         Statements.)
                              Net income declined $242.0 million in 1993 to
                         $396.3 million from $638.3 million in 1992 and net
                         income per share declined to $1.53 from $2.40. The
                         1993 results included the effects of the prescribed
                         accounting change, the company's restructuring
                         strategy and the lower effective tax rate. The 1992
                         results included the gain on the sale of The Hubinger
                         Company.

..............................................................................
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL  Return on average shareholders' equity (ROE) was
POSITION:                25.9% in 1994, 22.0% in 1993 (before the cumulative
                         effect of adopting FAS No. 106) and 27.5% in 1992.
                         Pretax return on average invested capital (ROIC) was
                         22.7% in 1994 compared to 18.7% in 1993 and 28.8% in
                         1992. Both ROE and ROIC in 1992 included the effect
                         of the gain on the sale of The Hubinger Company. The
                         increase in both ROE and ROIC in 1994 was primarily
                         attributable to restructuring initiatives and
                         divestitures.
                              Cash provided by operating activities was $931.2
                         million in 1994, which increased $519.3 million from
                         $411.9 million in 1993. The increase was the result
                         of lower working capital requirements, resulting from
                         trade "de-loading," offset partially by expenditures
                         on the restructuring program.
                              In 1993, cash provided by operating activities
                         decreased $65.3 million to $411.9 million, from
                         $477.2 million in 1992. The decline was primarily the
                         result of increased working capital, specifically
                         receivables, inventories and income taxes payable.
                              Cash used for investing activities was $27.4
                         million in 1994 versus $829.8 million in 1993. The
                         decrease in cash used for investing activities was
                         due primarily to lower capital expenditures, a
                         reduction in cash used for acquisitions and increased
                         proceeds from divestitures.
                              Capital expenditures totaled $275.1 million in
                         1994 and $430.7 million in 1993. Both years reflected
                         expenditures for productivity improvements and plant
                         expansions, principally at the company's Ore-Ida,
                         United Kingdom, Heinz U.S.A., StarKist Foods and
                         Weight Watchers operations. Major capital spending
                         projects, such as the Pittsburgh factory and the
                         factory improvements in the United Kingdom, have been
                         completed and the company does not anticipate
                         undertaking any additional significant projects in
                         the near future.
                              Acquisitions in 1994 included the Moore's and
                         Domani product lines (see Note 2 to the Consolidated
                         Financial Statements) and Farex (a baby food company
                         in Australia). Acquisitions in 1993 totaled $370.2
                         million, which included: the purchase of Wattie's
                         Limited (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
                         Statements); Arimpex (a foodservice distribution
                         company in Italy); Weight Watchers franchises in
                         Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky; and
                         assets of a Venezuelan company which produces
                         gelatins and puddings.
                              Current-year divestitures included proceeds from
                         the Near East specialty rice business and the Italian
                         confectionery

                                                                              35

                         business. In addition, the company sold
                         several small businesses in 1994, including the
                         Chico-San rice cake business. The financial statement
                         impact of these other small divestitures, taken
                         together, was not material. Pro forma results of the
                         company, assuming all of the 1994 divestitures had
                         been made at the beginning of each period presented,
                         would not be materially different from the results
                         reported. (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
                         Statements.)
                              Purchases and sales/maturities of short-term
                         investments increased from 1993 to 1994, primarily as
                         a result of the investment of the proceeds from the
                         sale of the Italian confectionery business in Italian
                         short-term securities.
                              Financing activities required $861.5 million in
                         1994, compared to providing $405.2 million in 1993.
                         In 1994, cash was used to reduce short-term debt, to
                         pay dividends and to purchase treasury stock. In
                         1993, proceeds from long-term debt totaled $969.4
                         million, primarily due to the issuance of the long-
                         term senior unsecured notes totaling $750 million.
                              Cash provided by financing activities in 1993
                         also included proceeds from the issuance of
                         (pound sterling)125 million ($197.0 million) of 8.85%
                         notes. These notes were issued by the company's United 
                         Kingdom affiliate and were privately placed with
                         various banks. The proceeds of the above-mentioned
                         issuances were used to refinance existing debt.
                         (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
                              In 1993, payments on long-term debt totaled
                         $240.2 million and were mainly the result of the
                         payment of the NZ$150.0 million debt ($84.3 million).
                         Also, in April 1993, an affiliated company paid
                         (pound sterling)70.6 million ($111.3 million) for an
                         interest in the 8.85% (pound sterling)125 million
                         notes discussed above.
                              During 1994, the Board of Directors authorized
                         an increase of 10.0% in the quarterly dividend for
                         common stock from 30 cents per share to 33 cents per
                         share. The company paid $326.0 million in dividends
                         to both common and preferred shareholders, an
                         increase of $28.9 million over 1993. The dividend
                         rate in effect at the end of each year resulted in a
                         payout ratio of 56.2% in 1994, 58.8% in 1993 (before
                         the cumulative effect of the accounting change) and
                         45.0% in 1992.
                              Cash used for financing activities also included
                         the purchase of treasury stock. In 1994, 6.5 million
                         shares were repurchased at a cost of $222.6 million.
                         The 10 million share repurchase program, which began
                         in December 1991, was completed in June 1993. As of
                         April 27, 1994, 6.0 million shares were repurchased
                         as part of the new 10 million share repurchase
                         program, which was authorized by the Board of
                         Directors on June 9, 1993. The company plans to
                         complete the current program in 1995. During 1993,
                         3.9 million shares were repurchased at a cost of
                         $148.5 million under the previous repurchase program.
                         The company may reissue repurchased shares upon the
                         exercise of stock options, conversion of preferred
                         stock and for general corporate purposes.
                              The Board of Directors adopted, effective April
                         13, 1994, subject to the approval of the shareholders
                         at the annual meeting in September 1994, a new stock
                         option plan providing for the grant of up to 12.0
                         million shares of common stock at any time over the
                         next 10 years. As of April 27, 1994, options for
                         approximately 6.3 million shares had been
                         contingently granted under this plan. In general, the
                         terms of the 1994 plan are similar to the company's
                         other stock option plans.
                              On September 7, 1993, the company replaced its
                         line of credit agreements supporting domestic
                         commercial paper. The new line of credit agreements
                         total $1.5 billion, of which $750 million expires in
                         September 1994, at which time it is anticipated that
                         a new credit facility of at least one year in length
                         will be established. The remaining $750 million
                         expires in August 1996. As a result, $750 million of
                         the domestic commercial paper outstanding as of April
                         27, 1994 is classified as long-term debt. At fiscal
                         year-end 1993, total domestic commercial paper
                         outstanding of $1.2 billion was classified as short-
                         term debt. The domestic commercial paper had a
                         weighted average interest rate during 1994 of 3.3%
                         and at year-end of 3.6%. In 1993, the weighted
                         average rate was 3.4% and the rate at year-end was
                         3.2%.
                              In November 1992, the Financial Accounting
                         Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Accounting
                         Standard (FAS) No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
                         Postemployment Benefits." This statement requires
                         recognition of benefits provided by an employer to
                         former or inactive employees after employment but
                         before retirement. In May 1993, the FASB issued FAS
                         No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
                         and Equity Securities." This statement expands the
                         use of fair value accounting for debt and equity
                         securities, but retains the use of the amortized cost
                         method for investments in debt securities that the
                         company intends to hold to

                         maturity. These statements must be implemented in the
                         first quarter of Fiscal 1995. The impact of the
                         adoption of these standards is not expected to have
                         a material impact on the company's financial position
                         or results of operations.
                              The impact of inflation on both the company's
                         financial position and results of operations has been
                         minimal and is not expected to adversely affect 1995
                         results.
                              The company's financial position continues to
                         remain strong, enabling it to meet cash requirements
                         for operations, capital expansion programs and
                         dividends to shareholders.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS                                 H.J. HEINZ COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
..............................................................................
1. SIGNIFICANT           Fiscal Year: The company operates on a fiscal year
ACCOUNTING POLICIES:     ending the Wednesday nearest April 30. However,
                         certain foreign subsidiaries have earlier closing
                         dates to facilitate timely reporting. Fiscal years
                         for the financial statements included herein ended
                         April 27, 1994, April 28, 1993 and April 29, 1992.

                         Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated
                         financial statements include the accounts of the
                         company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany
                         accounts and transactions were eliminated.

                         Translation of Foreign Currencies: For all
                         significant foreign operations, the functional
                         currency is the local currency. Assets and
                         liabilities of these operations are translated at the
                         exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income
                         statement accounts are translated at the average rate
                         of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
                         adjustments arising from the use of differing
                         exchange rates from period to period are included as
                         a component of shareholders' equity. Gains and losses
                         from foreign currency transactions are included in
                         net income for the period.

                         Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of
                         cost or market. Cost is determined principally under
                         the average cost method.

                         Property, Plant and Equipment: Land, buildings and
                         equipment are recorded at cost. For financial
                         reporting purposes, depreciation is provided on the
                         straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
                         of the assets. Accelerated depreciation methods are
                         generally used for income tax purposes. Expenditures
                         for new facilities and improvements that
                         substantially extend the capacity or useful life of
                         an asset are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and
                         maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property
                         is retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and
                         related depreciation are removed from the accounts
                         and any related gains or losses are included in
                         income.

                         Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes result primarily
                         from temporary differences between financial and tax
                         reporting. If it is more likely than not that some
                         portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be
                         realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.
                              The company has not provided for possible U.S.
                         taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign
                         subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested
                         indefinitely. Calculation of the unrecognized
                         deferred tax liability for temporary differences
                         related to these earnings is not practicable. Where
                         it is contemplated that earnings will be remitted,
                         credit for foreign taxes already paid generally will
                         offset applicable U.S. income taxes. In cases where
                         they will not offset U.S. income taxes, appropriate
                         provisions are included in the Consolidated
                         Statements of Income.

                         Net Income Per Common Share: Net income per common
                         share has been computed by dividing income applicable
                         to common shareholders by the weighted average number
                         of shares of common stock outstanding and common
                         stock equivalents during the respective years. Fully
                         diluted earnings per share are not significantly
                         different from primary earnings per share and,
                         accordingly, are not presented.

                         Intangibles: Goodwill and other intangibles arising
                         from acquisitions are being amortized on a straight-
                         line basis over periods not exceeding 40 years. The
                         company regularly reviews the individual components
                         of the balances by analyzing the future
                         recoverability of the assets and recognizes, on a
                         current basis, any diminution in value.

                         Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents are defined as
                         highly liquid investments with original maturities of
                         90 days or less.

                                                                              43

                         Business Segment Information: Information concerning
                         business segment and geographic data is in
                         Management's Discussion and Analysis.
..............................................................................
2. ACQUISITIONS:         On July 1, 1993, the company purchased the Moore's
                         and Domani product lines from The Clorox Company of
                         Oakland, California for approximately $90 million.
                         The acquisition resulted in goodwill of approximately
                         $53 million, which will be amortized over a period of
                         40 years.
                              The Moore's product range includes coated frozen
                         foods, specifically breaded onion rings, cheeses and
                         vegetables. Domani offers frozen pasta, including
                         manicotti, shells, tortellini, ravioli and lasagna.
                         The acquired product lines strengthen the company's
                         presence in the foodservice industry.
                              On October 7, 1992, the company purchased
                         Wattie's Limited of Auckland, New Zealand from
                         Goodman Fielder Wattie Limited of Sydney, Australia
                         for approximately $300 million. The acquisition
                         resulted in goodwill of approximately $115 million
                         and other intangible assets of approximately $35
                         million. These items are being amortized over periods
                         not exceeding 40 years.
                              During 1993, the company also acquired Arimpex,
                         a foodservice distribution company in Italy; Weight
                         Watchers franchises in Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota
                         and Kentucky; and assets of a Venezuelan company that
                         produces gelatins and puddings.
                              The above acquisitions have been accounted for
                         as purchases and, accordingly, the purchase prices
                         have been allocated to the respective assets and
                         liabilities based on their estimated fair values as
                         of the dates of the acquisitions. Operating results
                         of these acquisitions have been included in the
                         Consolidated Statements of Income from the dates of
                         the acquisitions forward. Pro forma results of the
                         company, assuming the above-noted acquisitions had
                         been made at the beginning of each period presented,
                         would not be materially different from the results
                         reported.
                              On August 23, 1991, the company completed the
                         acquisition of substantially all of the assets of
                         JLFoods, Inc. (JLFoods) of Eugene, Oregon and
                         certain other related assets from John Labatt Ltd. of
                         Canada for $537.5 million. The acquisition has been
                         accounted for under the purchase method and,
                         accordingly, the operating results of JLFoods have
                         been included in the consolidated operating results
                         since the date of acquisition.
                              The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $320.5
                         million and other intangible assets of $79.8 million.
                         These items are being amortized over periods not
                         exceeding 40 years.
                              The following summary, prepared on a pro forma
                         basis, combines the consolidated results of
                         operations as if JLFoods had been acquired as of the
                         beginning of 1992, after including the impact of
                         certain adjustments, such as amortization of
                         intangibles, increased interest expense on the
                         acquisition debt, and the related income tax effects.

                         The pro forma results are not necessarily
                         indicative of what actually would have occurred if
                         the acquisition had been in effect for all of 1992.
                              During 1992, the company also acquired
                         Continental Delights, Inc., a manufacturer of frozen
                         sandwiches; Escalon Packers, Inc., a specialty
                         processor of branded and foodservice tomato products;
                         and two Weight Watchers franchises. Other smaller
                         acquisitions were made. The results of operations of
                         these companies are included in the Consolidated
                         Statements of Income from the acquisition dates
                         forward. Pro forma results of the company, assuming
                         the other 1992 acquisitions had been made at the
                         beginning of the year, would not be materially
                         different from the results reported.

3. DIVESTITURES:         On August 20, 1993, the company sold its Near East
                         specialty rice business to Golden Grain Company, a
                         subsidiary of The Quaker Oats Company, for
                         approximately $80 million. The sale included
                         trademarks, inventory and fixed assets, including
                         Near East's Leominster, Massachusetts plant, where
                         Near East products are produced. On September 15,
                         1993, the company sold its confectionery business of
                         Heinz Italia S.p.A. to Hershey Foods Corporation for
                         approximately $133 million. The divestiture included
                         brand names, inventory and fixed assets. The pretax
                         gains on these divestitures totaled $127.0 million,
                         or $0.24 per share.
                              During 1994, the company also sold several other
                         small businesses, including the Chico-San rice cake
                         business, which did not have a material impact on the
                         results of operations. Pro forma results of the
                         company, assuming all of the 1994 divestitures had
                         been made at the beginning of each period presented,
                         would not be materially different from the results
                         reported.
                              In June 1991, the company sold The Hubinger
                         Company of Keokuk, Iowa to Roquette Freres, a major
                         worldwide producer of corn starches, for
                         approximately $325.3 million. Hubinger is a producer
                         of corn derivatives, including corn syrup, starch and
                         ethanol. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $221.5
                         million. Other 1992 divestitures did not have a
                         material effect on operations.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES:In 1993, restructuring charges of $192.3 million on
                         a pretax basis ($0.45 per share) were reflected in
                         operating income. The major components of the
                         restructuring plan related to employee severance and
                         relocation costs ($99 million) and facilities
                         consolidation and closure costs ($73 million). At the
                         time these charges were recorded, it was anticipated
                         that the company would reduce headcount by 3,000. As
                         of April 27, 1994, headcount has been reduced by
                         approximately 2,000. Upon completion of all of the
                         projects in 1995, it is anticipated that the total
                         headcount reduction will be achieved.
                              In 1992, restructuring charges of $88.3 million
                         on a pretax basis ($0.20 per share) were reflected in

5. INCOME TAXES:         During 1992, the company adopted FAS No. 109,
                         "Accounting for Income Taxes." The statement requires
                         the use of the asset and liability approach for
                         financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
                         Financial statements for prior years have not been
                         restated and the cumulative effect of the accounting
                         change was not material.
                              The following table summarizes the provision for
                         U.S. federal and U.S. possessions, state and foreign
                         taxes on income.

                         1993. The 1993 tax provision also benefited from an
                         adjustment of deferred taxes for an enacted foreign
                         statutory rate change ($19.8 million) and an increase

                         elected to revalue for tax purposes certain assets as
                         a result of legislation enacted by the Italian
                         Parliament. The revaluation required payment of $77
                         million over two years for approximately $180 million
                         in future tax benefits. One installment payment was
                         made in 1992 for $44.7 million. The remaining payment
                         was made in 1993 for $32.3 million.

</TABLE>

                         The amount of long-term debt that matures in
                         each of the four years succeeding 1995 is: $49.1
                         million in 1996, $844.6 million in 1997, $269.3
                         million in 1998 and $23.9 million in 1999.
                              On September 7, 1993, the company replaced its
                         line of credit agreements supporting domestic
                         commercial paper. The new line of credit agreements
                         total $1.5 billion, of which $750 million expires in
                         September 1994, at which time it is anticipated that
                         a new credit facility of at least one year in length
                         will be established. The remaining $750 million
                         expires in August 1996. As a result, $750 million of
                         the domestic commercial paper outstanding as of April
                         27, 1994 is classified as long-term debt. The
                         domestic commercial paper had a weighted average
                         interest rate during the year of 3.3% and at year-end
                         of 3.6%.
                              The company also maintains a commercial paper
                         program in Canada. Outstanding Canadian commercial
                         paper, which is also classified as short-term debt,
                         was $107.7 million as of April 27, 1994. The weighted
                         average interest rate for Canadian commercial paper
                         during 1994 was 4.8% and at year-end was 4.4%. In
                         addition, the company had $673.3 million of other
                         foreign and other domestic lines of credit available
                         at year-end, principally for overdraft protection.
                              During 1993, the company issued senior unsecured
                         notes in three separate issuances totaling
                         approximately $750 million. These notes were issued
                         at interest rates ranging from 5.5% to 6.875% and
                         with maturity dates extending from 1998 through 2003.
                              In 1993, the company's United Kingdom affiliate
                         privately placed with various banks (pound
                         sterling)125 million ($197.0 million) aggregate
                         principal of 8.85% notes due during 2013. In April
                         1993, an affiliated company paid (pound sterling)70.6
                         million ($111.3 million) for an interest in the notes.
                         The notes are shown in the balance sheet as a net
                         amount outstanding of (pound sterling)48.0 million
                         ($71.5 million), which will be fully amortized in six
                         years. The effective interest rate was 8.3% at April
                         27, 1994 and April 28, 1993.

                                                                              47

                         Capital Stock: The preferred stock outstanding
                         is convertible at a rate of one share of preferred
                         stock into 9.0 shares of common stock. The company
                         can redeem the stock at $28.50 per share.
                              On April 27, 1994, there were authorized, but
                         unissued, 2,200,000 shares of third cumulative
                         preferred stock for which the series had not been
                         designated.

                         Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP): The company
                         established an ESOP in 1990 to replace in full or in
                         part the company's cash-matching contributions to the
                         H.J. Heinz Company Employees Retirement and Savings
                         Plan, a 401(k) plan for salaried employees. Matching
                         contributions to the 401(k) plan are based on a
                         percentage of the participant's contributions,
                         subject to certain limitations.
                              To finance the plan, the ESOP borrowed $50.0
                         million directly from the company in 1990. The loan
                         is in the form of a 15-year variable-rate interest-
                         bearing note (an average of 4.2%, 4.1% and 6.1% for
                         1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively) and is included in
                         the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as unearned
                         compensation. The proceeds of the note were used to
                         purchase 1,577,908 shares of treasury stock from the
                         company at approximately $31.70 per share.
                              The stock held by the ESOP is released for
                         allocation to the participants' accounts over the
                         term of the loan as company contributions to the ESOP
                         are made. The company contributions are reported as
                         compensation and interest expense. Compensation
                         expense related to the ESOP for 1994, 1993 and 1992
                         was $3.3 million, $2.7 million and $2.7 million,
                         respectively. Interest expense was $1.7 million, $1.7
                         million and $2.1 million for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
                         respectively. The company's contributions to the ESOP
                         and the dividends on the company stock held by the
                         ESOP are used to repay loan interest and principal.
                              The dividends on the company stock held by the
                         ESOP were $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million
                         in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

                         Cumulative Translation Adjustments: Changes in the
                         cumulative translation component of shareholders'
                         equity result principally from translation of
                         financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into
                         U.S. dollars. The reduction in shareholders' equity
                         related to the translation component increased $70.7
                         million in 1994, increased $107.6 million in 1993,
                         and decreased $13.9 million in 1992.

9. EMPLOYEES' STOCK      Under the company's stock option plans, officers and
OPTION PLANS AND         other key employees may be granted options, each of
MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE     which allows for the purchase of shares of the
PLANS:                   company's common stock. The option price on all
                         outstanding options is equal to the fair market value
                         of the stock at the date of grant.
                              The Board of Directors adopted, effective April
                         13, 1994, subject to the approval of the shareholders
                         at the annual meeting in September 1994, a new stock
                         option plan providing for the grant of up to 12.0
                         million shares of common stock at any time over the
                         next 10 years. As of April 27, 1994, options for
                         approximately 6.3 million shares had been
                         contingently granted under this plan. In general, the
                         terms of the 1994 plan are similar to the company's
                         other stock option plans.
                              The shares authorized but not granted under the
                         company's stock option plans were 5,717,590 at April
                         27, 1994 and 2,711,590 at April 28, 1993.

10. RETIREMENT PLANS:    The company maintains retirement plans for the
                         majority of its employees. Benefits are based on
                         years of service and compensation or stated amounts
                         for each year of service. Plan assets are primarily
                         invested in equities and fixed income securities. The
                         company's funding policy for the domestic plans is to
                         contribute annually not less than the ERISA minimum
                         funding standards nor more than the maximum amount
                         which can be deducted for federal income tax
                         purposes. Generally, foreign plans are funded in
                         amounts sufficient to comply with local regulations
                         and ensure adequate funds to pay benefits to retirees
                         as they become due.

                         Assumptions for foreign plans are developed on a
                         basis consistent with those for U.S. plans, adjusted
                         for prevailing economic conditions.
                              In April 1992, the Board of Directors amended
                         the domestic salaried defined benefit pension plan to
                         provide that no benefits would accrue under this plan
                         on or after January 1, 1993. At the same time, the
                         Board expanded, effective January 1, 1993, the
                         defined contribution plan covering substantially all
                         domestic salaried employees, described below. The
                         Board's actions on the defined benefit pension plan
                         resulted in an after-tax curtailment gain of $23.6
                         million, which was recorded in 1992. No plan assets
                         were withdrawn from the pension plan as a result of
                         this curtailment.
                              The company maintains defined contribution plans
                         for the majority of its domestic non-union and
                         salaried employees. Benefits are provided through
                         company contribution accounts which consist solely of
                         company contributions that are a percentage of the
                         participant's pay based on age, with the contribution
                         rate increasing with age. In addition, certain non-
                         union employees receive supplemental contributions,
                         which are paid at the discretion of the company, and
                         matching contributions based on a percentage of the
                         participant's contributions to the 401(k) portion of
                         the plan. (The company's matching contributions for
                         salaried employees are provided under the ESOP.) The
                         expense recognized as a result of company
                         contributions to the defined contribution plans,
                         excluding the ESOP, totaled $16.5 million in 1994. In
                         1993, $4.5 million was expensed for the company
                         defined contribution plans.

11. POSTRETIREMENT       In addition to providing pension benefits, the
BENEFITS OTHER THAN      company and certain of its subsidiaries provide
PENSIONS AND OTHER       health care and life insurance benefits for retired
POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of
                         the company's U.S. and Canadian employees may become
                         eligible for such benefits. In general,
                         postretirement medical coverage is provided for
                         eligible non-union and salaried employees with at
                         least 10 years of service rendered after the age of
                         45 and eligible union employees who retire with an
                         immediate pension benefit. The company currently does
                         not fund these benefit arrangements and may modify
                         plan provisions or terminate plans at its discretion.
                              Effective January 1, 1994, certain changes were
                         made to postretirement medical benefits offered to
                         U.S. salaried and non-union employees who retire
                         after May 1, 1994. Those retirees will be required to
                         share in the cost of providing these benefits at
                         percentages increasing from 20% in 1994 to 100% in
                         1998. The resulting curtailment gain was immaterial.
                              In 1993, the company adopted Statement of
                         Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 106,
                         "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
                         Other Than Pensions." FAS No. 106 requires that the
                         accrual method of accounting for postretirement
                         benefits other than pensions be used and the accrual
                         period be based on the period that the employees
                         render the services necessary to earn their
                         postretirement benefits. Effective April 30, 1992,
                         the company elected to recognize immediately the
                         accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
                         active and retired employees, resulting in an after-
                         tax cumulative charge of $133.6 million (net of
                         income tax benefit of $85.4 million), or $0.51 per
                         share. In addition, the adoption of FAS No. 106
                         increased the company's pretax postretirement benefit
                         expense by $16.3 million ($0.04 per share) in 1993.
                         These charges had no effect on consolidated cash
                         flows.
                              Net postretirement costs consisted of the
                         following:

                         The weighted average discount rate used in the
                         calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit
                         obligation and the net postretirement benefit cost
                         was 8.0% in 1994 and 8.1% in 1993. The assumed annual
                         composite rate of increase in the per capita cost of
                         company-provided health care benefits begins at 11.5%
                         for 1995, gradually decreases to 5.8% by 2010, and
                         remains at that level thereafter. A 1% increase in
                         these health care cost trend rates would cause the
                         accumulated postretirement obligation to increase by
                         $20.0 million, and the aggregate of the service and
                         interest components of 1994 net postretirement
                         benefit costs to increase by $3.2 million.
                              Prior to 1993, the cost of retiree health care
                         and life insurance benefits was expensed as incurred.
                         These costs totaled $6.8 million in 1992.
                              In November 1992, the FASB issued FAS No. 112,
                         "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."
                         This statement requires recognition of benefits
                         provided by an employer to former or inactive
                         employees after employment but before retirement. The
                         statement must be implemented in the first quarter of
                         Fiscal 1995. The impact of the adoption of this
                         standard is not expected to have a material impact on
                         the company's financial position or results of
                         operations.

                         Second-quarter 1994 results include gains on the sale
                         of the confectionery and specialty rice businesses,
                         that totaled $127.0 million on a pretax basis ($0.24
                         per share). (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
                         Statements.)
                              Fourth-quarter 1994 earnings benefited from a
                         lower effective tax rate resulting from tax benefits
                         from overseas operations of $57.3 million ($0.22 per
                         share). (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
                         Statements.)
                              First-quarter 1993 results have been restated to
                         include the cumulative effect of adopting FAS No.
                         106. (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
                         Statements.) The fourth quarter also includes a $16.3
                         million pretax charge ($0.04 per share), which
                         represents the 1993 effect of adopting FAS No. 106.
                              Also in the fourth quarter of 1993, pretax
                         restructuring charges of $181.9 million ($0.43 per
                         share) were recorded. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated
                         Financial Statements.) Fourth-quarter earnings
                         benefited from a lower effective tax rate resulting
                         from tax benefits overseas and the recognition of
                         foreign tax credits associated with the company's
                         overseas dividend strategy. (See Note 5 to the

13. COMMITMENTS AND      Legal Matters: On December 31, 1992, a food wholesale
CONTINGENCIES:           distributor filed suit against the company and its
                         principal competitors in the U.S. baby food industry.
                         Subsequent to that date, several similar lawsuits
                         were filed in the same court and have been
                         consolidated into a class action suit. The
                         complaints, each of which seeks an injunction and
                         unspecified treble money damages, allege a conspiracy
                         to fix, maintain and stabilize the prices of baby
                         food. Related suits have also been filed in Alabama
                         and California state courts, seeking to represent a
                         class of indirect purchasers of baby food in the
                         respective states. The company believes all of the
                         suits are without merit and will defend itself
                         vigorously against them. Certain other claims have
                         been filed against the company or its subsidiaries
                         and have not been finally adjudicated. The above-
                         mentioned claims, when finally concluded and
                         determined, in the opinion of management, based upon
                         the information that it presently possesses, will not
                         have a material adverse effect on the company's
                         consolidated financial position or results of
                         operations.

                         Financial Instruments: The company's financial
                         instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-
                         and long-term investments, short- and long-term debt,
                         interest rate swap agreements, currency exchange
                         agreements and guarantees. The carrying values of all
                         instruments approximated their fair values at April
                         27, 1994 and April 28, 1993. The fair values of the
                         instruments were based upon quoted market prices of
                         the same or similar instruments or on a discounted
                         basis using the rates available to the company for
                         instruments of the same remaining maturities.
                              The counterparties to the currency exchange and
                         swap agreements consist of large major international
                         financial institutions. The company continually
                         monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its
                         counterparties and, by policy, limits the amount of
                         credit exposure to any one party. While the company
                         may be exposed to potential losses due to credit risk
                         in the event of non-performance by these
                         counterparties, it does not anticipate losses.
                              In May 1993, the FASB issued FAS No. 115,
                         "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
                         Equity Securities." This statement expands the use of
                         fair value accounting for debt and equity securities,
                         but retains the use of the amortized cost method for
                         investments in debt securities that the company
                         intends to hold to maturity. This statement must be
                         implemented in the first quarter of Fiscal 1995. The
                         impact of the adoption of this standard is not
                         expected to have a material impact on the company's
                         financial position or results of operations.

                         Lease Commitments: Operating lease rentals for
                         warehouse, production and office facilities and
                         equipment amounted to approximately $94.0 million in
                         1994, $89.7 million in 1993 and $78.4 million in
                         1992. Future lease payments for non-cancellable
                         operating leases as of April 27, 1994 totaled $202.2
                         million (1995-$49.7 million, 1996-$37.6 million,
                         1997-$28.7 million, 1998-$21.2 million, 1999-$13.0
                         million and thereafter-$52.0 million).

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:   On May 16, 1994, the company acquired the Borden
                         Foodservice Group, a unit of Borden, Inc. Borden's
                         Foodservice Group includes a single-serve line of
                         condiments and bulk-sized oil-based products, such as
                         salad dressings and mayonnaise.
                              On May 26, 1994, the company announced that it
                         had entered into negotiations with Glaxo India
                         Limited, based in Bombay, to acquire Glaxo's Family
                         Products Division, which produces a wide range of
                         nutritional drinks, baby food and other consumer
                         products. This transaction has been approved by both
                         companies' boards of directors, but is subject to
                         completion of negotiations, authorization from the
                         Indian government and approval by Glaxo India
                         Limited's shareholders.
                              On May 27, 1994, the company announced that it
                         had agreed to acquire the Farley's infant food and
                         milk business as well as its adult nutrition business
                         from The Boots Company PLC of Nottingham, England for
                         approximately $140 million. Farley's product
                         offerings include a wide range of baby feeding
                         products, from formulas to post-weaning biscuits,
                         cereals and dry meals. It also sells adult meal
                         supplements under the brand name Complan. The
                         transaction is subject to the approval of the
                         appropriate governmental authorities.
                              Pro forma results of the company, assuming
                         probable and completed acquisitions had been made at
                         the beginning of each period presented, would not be
                         materially different from the results reported.

                                                                              53

          RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENTS
          ....................................................................
          Responsibility for Financial Statements

          Management of H.J. Heinz Company is responsible for the
          preparation of the financial statements and other information
          included in this annual report. The financial statements have been
          prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
          principles, incorporating management's best estimates and judgments,
          where applicable.
             Management believes that the company's internal control systems
          provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded,
          transactions are recorded and reported appropriately, and policies
          are followed. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that
          the cost of a control procedure should not exceed the expected
          benefits. Management believes that its systems provide this
          appropriate balance. An important element of the company's control
          systems is the ongoing program to promote control consciousness
          throughout the organization. Management's commitment to this program
          is emphasized through written policies and procedures (including a
          code of conduct), an effective internal audit function and a
          qualified financial staff.
             The company engages independent public accountants who are
          responsible for performing an independent audit of the financial
          statements. Their report, which appears herein, is based on
          obtaining an understanding of the company's accounting systems and
          procedures and testing them as they deem necessary.
             The company's Audit Committee is composed entirely of outside
          directors. The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when appropriate
          separately, with the independent public accountants, the internal
          auditors and financial management to review the work of each and to
          satisfy itself that each is discharging its responsibilities
          properly. Both the independent public accountants and the internal
          auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.
  
          ....................................................................
          Independent Accountants' Report

          The Shareholders
          H.J. Heinz Company:

          We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of H.J.
          Heinz Company and subsidiaries as of April 27, 1994 and April 28,
          1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, retained
          earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
          ended April 27, 1994. These financial statements are the
          responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to
          express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
          audits.
             We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
          auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
          the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
          statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
          examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
          disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
          assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
          made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
          statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
          reasonable basis for our opinion.
             In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
          present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
          position of H.J. Heinz Company and subsidiaries as of April 27, 1994
          and April 28, 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations
          and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
          April 27, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
          principles.
             As discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
          the company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
          Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
          Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" in Fiscal 1993.
