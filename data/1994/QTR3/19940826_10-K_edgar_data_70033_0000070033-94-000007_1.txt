                                 PART I
Item 1.  BUSINESS

General

        National Data Corporation (the "Company"), incorporated in 1967,
is focused on providing value-added systems and services to the health
care, integrated payment systems, and government and corporate markets.
In the health care area the Company engages principally in providing
practice management systems and electronic claims processing,
adjudication and clinical data base information for pharmacies,
dentists, physicians, hospitals, health maintenance organizations
("HMO's"), clinics, nursing homes and other health care markets.  The
Company also provides integrated payment systems solutions such as
credit card, debit card and check verification/guarantee services for
retailers, health care providers, universities and colleges and
government agencies.  The Company also provides cash management,
information reporting and electronic data interchange ("EDI") services
for corporate and government customers.  In addition, the Company has
developed electronic tax payment and filing systems.  Services are
provided through centralized host, distributed microprocessor-based and
value-added telecommunications networks accessing real-time information
processing systems capable of sending and receiving information
utilizing a variety of terminals, PC's and other communication devices.
The network operates seven days a week, 24 hours per day.

        The Company is one of the largest independent providers of
value-added applications systems and services for the health care and
integrated payment systems markets in the United States.

Services

        The Company's products and services are provided in the
following lines of business: (i) health care application systems and
services, (ii) integrated payment systems, (iii) government and
corporate information systems and services and (iv) international
services.  A decision was made to exit the communication services
business in 1991.  All remaining communication services contracts are
expected to expire during the coming fiscal year ending May 31, 1995,
and the amount of future business is not material.

HEALTH CARE APPLICATION SYSTEMS AND SERVICES (HCASS)

        HCASS is a leading provider of a full range of products and
 services to address health care cost containment and improved patient
 care issues.  The Company's complete line of products includes practice
 management systems and electronic claims processing, adjudication and
 payment systems, funding capabilities and clinical data base
 information for pharmacies, dentists, physicians, hospitals, HMO's,
 clinics and nursing homes.  Approximately 31% of the Company's revenue
 in fiscal 1994 was derived from these products and services.  This is
 the fastest growing portion of the Company's business.

        The Company's DataStat pharmacy practice management systems
provide solutions for independent and chain pharmacies, hospitals,
HMO's, clinics and nursing homes.  The systems enable the pharmacist to
manage and perform patient registration, drug record-keeping, private
and third-party billing, inventory control and ordering, automatic price
updating, management reporting and drug database updates to detect
clinical dispensing and prescribing errors.  DataStat systems provide
value-added claims processing and switching services as well.  The
services are offered through systems that are sold and maintained by the
Company and tailored to the needs of users utilizing micro- and mini-
computer platforms selected for the needs of each particular customer.
The Company's electronic point-of-sale systems meet the requirements of
retail pharmacies and are fully integrated into the DataStat product
line, providing credit and debit card processing capabilities and other
associated functions such as inventory reporting and ordering.

        During fiscal 1994 the Company brought to market the NDC Dental
System and began shipping in August 1994.  The NDC Dental System
operates in a Windows environment on IBM compatible personal computers.
This new system incorporates the business automation functions of the
DataStat dental system with advanced clinical functionality. The
Company's DataStat dental practice management system is designed to
provide dentists with patient record accounting, patient scheduling and
recall, billing and collection, and insurance claims information and
electronic processing to improve the efficiency of office management.

        In July 1994 the Company acquired the assets and business of
Lytec Systems, Inc. ("Lytec"), a Salt Lake City, Utah based provider of
practice management systems to the physician market.  Lytec is a leading
provider of practice management syst ems to this market, with
approximately 6,000 users. The Lytec products complement the Company's
current practice management and value-added transaction processing
capabilities.

        The Company's EasyClaim real-time electronic claims processing
service is offered to pharmacies, dentists, hospitals, HMO's and
preferred provider organizations.  The service includes eligibility
verification, patient-specific benefit coverage, claims data capture and
editing, claim adjudication, and retrospective and prospective drug
utilization review.  Electronic claims processing represents the
Company's fastest growing service.  The network includes approximately
49,000 health care provider locations.  Approximately 375 million real-
time electronic claims were processed in fiscal 1994, increasing 50%
over the prior year.

        The Company's practice management systems are primarily marketed
directly through the Company's personnel and jointly with pharmaceutical
wholesalers.  The practice management system for the physicians' market
is sold through third parties and direct marketing.  There is no
dominant competitor in the practice management systems market.  The
Company competes principally with General Computer Corporation, QS/1 and
the 3PM unit of McKesson Corporation in the pharmacy systems market.
The principal competitors in the dental systems market are Softdent and
Dentech.  The main competitors in the physicians' system market are The
Computer Place's MediSoft product and Medical Manager, sold by Systems
Plus, Inc.

        In the electronic claims processing market, in which the
 Company's services are offered directly through Company personnel, the
 Company's principal competitors are General Computer Corporation, Envoy
 Corporation, and Electronic Data Systems.  The Company believes that it
 is the leading provider of real-time electronic claims processing
 services based on the number of transactions processed.  Its value-
 added services, such as adjudication and clinical data bases, help
 distinguish the Company from those competitors who only serve as a
 transaction switch.

        Revenue for HCASS products and services is based upon software
license fees and purchase or lease payments for the practice management
systems, together with recurring monthly maintenance and support fees,
as well as upgrade charges for new applications capabilities.  Fees for
the electronic claims processing services are based on a per transaction
rate, with the rate varying depending upon the scope of services
provided.

INTEGRATED PAYMENT SYSTEMS

        The Company's Integrated Payment Systems ("IPS") unit provides a
 wide range of payment system alternatives to the retail, health care
 and government segments of this market.  Its name was changed from
 "Retail Application Systems and Services" to reflect the significant
 changes made during this past fiscal year to broaden the product lines
 and distribution channels in this area.  Credit card, debit card, check
 verification and check guarantee services are provided through direct
 distribution to merchants as well as indirectly through financial
 institutions.  Approximately 55% of the Company's fiscal 1994 revenue
 was derived from these services.

        The services provided by this unit, for both the direct and
indirect distribution channels, include credit and debit card
authorization, data capture and product and customer support functions,
primarily for VISA and MasterCard bank cards.  All major cards are
supported, however, including American Express, Discover and private
label cards.  In addition, for merchants  with a direct relationship,
the Company performs the financial settlement between the merchant and
the card associations .  With the direct relationship the Company
performs a variety of services, including a thorough credit review of
all prospective merchants.  Other functions performed include funding of
the credit/debit card sale, reconciliation of the financial settlement
and resolution of disputes between the Company's merchants and the
cardholder.  Fees for these services are principally based on the dollar
volume of transactions processed directly for merchants and a per
transaction rate for financial institutions where the Company indirectly
serves the merchant.


        In June 1994 the Company expanded its payment system services to
include check guarantee in addition to check verification services.
This was done through the acquisition of the assets and business of Yes
Check, Inc.  Check verification differs from check guarantee in that in
the former the Company verifies that the individual presenting a check
at the point-of-sale does not have a history of writing uncollectable
checks.  In the case of check guarantee, the Company not only verifies
the transaction; it also guarantees the retailer that it will be paid.
If a check is not paid, the Company reimburses the retailer and assumes
the right to collect from the individual writing the check.  Fees in the
check verification business are based on a per transaction rate, whereas
fees in the check guarantee market are based upon a percentage, or
discount, of the face value of each check guaranteed by the Company.

        During fiscal 1994 the Company announced its new procurement
 card service.  This service is aimed at corporate purchases of high-
 volume, small dollar items.  The product is credit card-based and is
 intended to significantly reduce the cost of making such small
 purchases, while at the same time provide the corporate purchasing
 department needed controls and management information relating to its
 purchases.

        The Company provides credit and debit authorizations utilizing
dial terminals, electronic cash registers, and proprietary personal
computer applications.  These systems provide financial institutions and
merchants with a comprehensive, nation wide authorization network for
credit cards, debit cards and checks.  They also provide information
data collection and reporting through point-of-sale terminal devices
located at the merchant's place of business.  Authorization requests are
transmitted from the merchant to the Company and then to the
appropriate source of the purchaser's credit file.  The response is then
relayed to the merchant.  Approximately 95% of all transactions
authorized are processed electronically.

        The Company also provides electronic data capture (EDC) systems
which incorporate the capabilities of its electronic point-of-sale
authorization system, combined with enhanced software, to enable the
Company to electronically capture the entire transaction and transmit
the necessary value-added information directly to the Company's central
computer system for faster clearing through the banking system.  This
allows the merchant organization quicker access to its funds and avoids
the necessity and cost of physically processing paper charge slips.
Specialized value-added applications for specialty retailers,
restaurants, hotels and oil companies are marketed by the Company.  In
addition, EDC is included in certain of the Company's he alth care
application systems and services products.

        The Company's tax payment product provides for the electronic
payment of corporate taxes.  The Company initiates the electronic funds
transfer process for payment of the taxes due, while delivering the
information summary to the appropriate government agency.  The Company's
tax filing product provides electronic filing of corporate tax returns.


        The Company markets its integrated payment products and services
 principally through its bank relationships, independent contractors and
 its own personnel.  The principal competition includes First Data
 Corporation, First Financial Management Corporation and Card
 Establishment Services, Inc., depending on the particular market
 segment.  Revenue in the IPS market has been affected by several
 industry trends.  First, the continued shift from voice to electronic
 transaction processing has negatively impacted revenue due to the
 significant difference in price per transaction.  Second, the sale by
 banks of their merchant processing businesses and the resulting loss of
 their merchant customers if the acquirer performs its own processing h
 as adversely affected revenue.  Third, portions of the IPS market also
 experienced continued price competition in fiscal 1994 and the Company
 believes this pressure will continue.  The pressure has reflected
 itself in a lower price per transaction trend in the indirect portion
 of the IPS business.  However, the Company's price adjustments have
 been partially offset by higher volume and longer term contract
 commitments from customers.  At the same time, the Company has reduced
 its costs of doing business through the use of new technology, new
 telecommunications arrangements and internal productivity programs.

        Operating nationwide and serving approximately 80,000 merchant
locations directly, and over 200 financial institutions supporting an
estimated 270,000 merchant locations, the Company is one of the leading
merchant processing companies in the nation.

GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SERVICES (GCISS)

        GCISS services include cash management, tax payment and filing,
information reporting and electronic data interchange (EDI).  The
services are designed to provide financial, management and operational
data to corporate and government institutions worldwide.  Approximately
10% of the Company's fiscal 1994 revenue was derived from these
services.

        Cash management products and services provide an electronic
window for the transmission of financial and other information
worldwide.  GCISS provides solutions to meet corporate needs including
multi-bank, multi-currency account activity; balance and transaction
detail information; wire transfer capabilities; automated clearinghouse
(ACH) funds transfer initiations; and cash concentration services.
Corporate and government organizations use these services to collect,
consolidate and report financial, administrative and operating data from
more than 200,000 locations.

        The Company's EDI service translates business-to-business
communications into standard or custom formats allowing the customer to
electronically exchange payments and remittance information with its
trading partners.

        The Company's bank deposit reporting, bank balance reporting,
and other financial and information services are offered in competition
with systems operated in-house by banks, with systems offered by other
third parties and with methods traditionally used by companies to
report and compile bank deposits.

INTERNATIONAL SERVICES

        Internationally, the Company provides certain of its products
 and services. These include the credit and debit card processing, cash
 management, information reporting and health care application systems
 and services products discussed above.  Services are marketed in
 Europe, Canada and Japan through the Company's personnel. Approximately
 2% of the Company's fiscal 1994 revenue was derived from these
 services.

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

        The Company is exiting this business.  Communications services
include operator services offered to both long distance and local
exchange telecommunications carriers.  The Company has reduced its
dependence on communications services since the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1991 when the Company decided to phase down
this portion of its business.  A small volume of communications services
business continues at this time.  The Company expects that substantially
all of this business will be terminated during fiscal 1995.
Approximately 2% of the Company's fiscal 1994 revenue was derived from
these services.

        At the end of fiscal 1993 the Company arranged an outsourcing
arrangement with a third party to buffer its work load as this business
was phased down.  The Company also transferred its Tucker, Georgia,
voice center to this third party.  In conjunction with the transaction,
the Company entered into an agreement to obtain certain voice operator
services from the purchaser for a three year period to supplement the
Company's remaining voice centers located in Dallas, Texas and Toronto,
Canada.

GOVERNMENT BUSINESS

        Approximately 4% of the Company's total revenue during fiscal
1994 was derived from contracts with, or as a subcontractor of
contractors with, the United States government.  All such contracts and
subcontracts are generally subject to termination at the convenience of
the United States Government whenever it believes that such termination
would be in its best interests.  Under contracts and subcontracts
terminated for the convenience of the United States government, the
Company is generally entitled to receive payment for work completed and
allowable termination costs.

Operations

        The Company maintains two computer processing sites in Atlanta,
 Georgia and one in Los Angeles, California supporting its real-time,
 on-line network.  The Company also maintains remote processing
 facilities in Toronto, Canada; London, England and Dallas, Texas.


        Tandem fault tolerant front-end processors along with UNISYS
multi-processor computers are utilized as the primary transaction
processors for real-time applications.  The computers run in a co-
processor mode enabling them to continue to function in the event a
single processor fails.  Information from all point-of-sale terminal
devices is received by the Tandem front-end communication systems.  The
Tandem systems determine the availability of mainframe computers and
then route transactions to the appropriate system.

        The Company's communications network is a redundant system.  All
 nodes are backed up and are serviced by at least two high-speed lines.
 Each network link has built in software to monitor the network on a
 continuing basis.  The communications network has been designed to
 operate on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week basis without scheduled down time .

        Competition

        The Company has a number of actual and potential competitors as
to all of the systems and services that it offers.  In addition to the
competition described above in the discussion of the Company's lines of
business, many of the Company's services receive direct competition as
a result of the marketing efforts of computer manufacturers to encourage
businesses to purchase or lease the manufacturers' computers and
establish in-house systems.  In addition to this actual competition, the
Com pany believes that there are several companies that have the
capability to offer some of the Company's services in competition with
the Company, certain of which are substantially larger than the Company.
The Company believes that its ability to off er integrated solutions to
its customers, including hardware, software, processing and network
facilities, is a positive factor pertaining to the competitive position
of the Company.  The Company recognizes, however, that its industry
segment is increasingly competitive.

        Product Development

        During the fiscal years ended May 31, 1994, May 31, 1993, and
May 31, 1992, the Company spent approximately $4,708,000, $3,825,000 and
$2,420,000, respectively, on activities relating to the development of
new products, services and techniques, and on the improvement and
maintenance of existing products, services and techniques.

        Employees

As of May 31, 1994 the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately
1,000 full-time employees and 525 hourly, variable labor employees.


        Financial Information Relating to Business Segment

        In addition to the leases referred to above, the Company leases
23 sales offices, two warehouse facilities, and various other facilities
for an aggregate annual rental of approximately $668,000.  The Company
also continues to pay rent on closed facilities with a total annual
rental of approximately $1,116,473, which obligations will expire
September, 1995.

        In January 1987, the Company took occupancy of a newly
constructed six-story, 120,000 square foot corporate headquarters
building adjacent to the One National Data Plaza building in Atlanta,
Georgia.  Permanent financing for the building of $ 12,000,000 is at a
fixed rate of 9.375% per year for a 10-year term and 30 year
amortization.  See Note 9 to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.

        The Company owns or leases a variety of computers and other
computer equipment for its operational needs.  In recent years the
Company has significantly upgraded and expanded its computers and
related equipment in order to increase efficiency, enhance reliability,
and provide the necessary base for business expansion.

        The Company believes that its facilities and equipment are
suitable and adequate for the business of the Company as presently
conducted.


Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        The Company and certain of its previous officers were party to
three lawsuits, which were consolidated as "National Data Corporation
Shareholder Litigation".  The Plaintiffs, purporting to act on behalf of
a class, alleged violations of rule 10(b) (5) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 under a "fraud on the market" theory for alleged
misrepresentations and omissions relating to expected earnings which
resulted in, the plaintiffs contended, the Company's common stock being
overvalu ed in the market.  The Company and the plaintiffs signed an
agreement in September, 1993 to settle this matter for $6,950,000.  The
Company's insurer bore two-thirds of the settlement and related future
costs.  The cost to the Company, net of income taxes and insurance
proceeds, was approximately $1,450,000.  Both the Company and its
insurer paid their full share of the settlement amount on December 1,
1993, and the settlement received final approval from the court in
December, 1993.

Overview
________________________________________________________________________

Revenue

Total revenue for fiscal 1994 was $204,006,000, a decrease of $550,000 (less
than 1%) from revenue of $204,556,000 for the previous year.  The reduction was
due principally to two factors.  The decision to exit the Communication Services
business caused a decline in revenue of $3,733,000 from the prior fiscal year.
Also, the Integrated Payment Systems business continues to be impacted by the
shift from voice to electronic authorization, as well as declining price trends
on new transactions in the indirect business, resulting in a decline in revenue
of $1,366,000.  These decreases were offset by an increase of $6,737,000 in the
Health Care Application Systems and Services business principally due to
increased electronic claims transaction volume.  A more detailed discussion of
the business unit results follows.

Integrated Payment Systems (IPS) revenue for fiscal 1994 was $112,427,000, a
decrease of $1,366,000 (1%) from revenue of $113,793,000 for the prior year,
with the decline occurring principally in the indirect (distribution through
banks) side of the business.  The indirect business represents approximately 45%
of total IPS revenues.

Direct revenue increased $2,387,000 (4%). Transaction volumes processed
increased by 4% and terminal sales and fees increased as well, primarily as a
result of a sales expansion program.

Indirect revenue decreased $3,753,000 (7%).  Voice authorization revenue
decreased $561,000 (6%) and electronic authorization and data capture revenue
decreased $3,192,000 (7%).  The decrease in voice authorization revenue is
attributable to a continued shift of business to electronic authorizations due
to lower prices to the merchants and a higher quality of service.  Voice
authorization processing volume declined approximately 10% in the period and now
represents 8% of total IPS revenue.  The decrease in electronic authorization
and data capture revenue was primarily the result of price reductions of
approximately 7%. The number of electronic authorization and data capture
transactions processed increased modestly in the current year.


Health Care Application Systems and Services (HCASS) revenue for fiscal 1994 was
$63,005,000, an increase of $6,737,000 (12%) from revenue of $56,268,000 for the
prior year.

Electronic Claims Processing revenue increased $9,663,000 (50%). This increase
was the result of a 51% increase in claims processed for the current customer
base and new customers added this year. The Company expects the growth trends in
electronic claims processing to continue.  Pharmacy/Dental Practice Management
Systems revenue decreased $1,970,000 (7%) in fiscal 1994.  This was primarily
the result of decreased sales of the microcomputer-based pharmacy and dental
practice management systems (DataStat) which was affected by the introduction of
a new Dental prodect.  This was offset by an increase in recurring maintenance
revenue associated with the growing installed systems base.  Revenue from sales
to government and institutional customers decreased $956,000 (10%), primarily as
a result of decreased turnkey systems sales to institutional customers and
overall reductions in defense department spending.


Government and Corporate Information Systems and Services revenue
for fiscal 1994 was $20,565,000, a decrease of $984,000 (5%) from revenue of
$21,549,000 for the prior year.  Reduced demand for cash management services is
caused largely by a trend toward movement of these services to in-house,
microcomputer-based systems. The reductions were partially offset by the
emerging electronic tax filing/payment systems and applications for electronic
data interchange (EDI).

Other revenue for fiscal 1994 was $8,009,000, a decrease of $4,937,000 (38%)
from revenue of $12,946,000 for the prior year.  This decrease was primarily the
result of the Company's decision to exit the communication services market in
1991.  The Company anticipates that this revenue will cease in the first quarter
of fiscal 1995 as contracts with various customers expire.  Weak economies in
Europe and Japan and the same cash management demand trends noted previously are
the primary causes of the revenue decline in the International business.

Costs and Expenses
________________________________________________________________________

Total cost of service was $117,208,000 for fiscal 1994.  This was a decrease of
$5,329,000 (4%) from last year.  This decrease was largely the result of a
reduction in cost of operations of $2,662,000 (3%), consisting principally of
payroll and telecommunications cost reductions.  Hardware costs decreased
$1,251,000 (11%), directly related to volume associated with reduced sales of
healthcare practice management systems. Depreciation and amortization expense
decreased $1,411,000 (9%) from last year.

Gross Margin increased to 43% from 40% in the prior year.

Sales, general and administrative expense was $68,411,000 for fiscal 1994.
This is an increase of $1,413,000 (2%) from the prior year.  This increase
was primarily due to sales expansion programs in the Integrated
Payment Systems and the Healthcare Application Systems and Services areas.


Investment and Other Income
________________________________________________________________________

Investment and other income for fiscal 1994 was $480,000, a decrease of
$1,371,000 (74%) below the prior year of $1,851,000.  This decrease was
principally a result of a decrease in interest income.  The lower interest
income resulted from the Company's sale of its pharmacy and dental systems lease
portfolio in fiscal 1993 (see note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).


Interest Expense, net
________________________________________________________________________

Net interest expense for 1994 was $1,508,000, a decrease of $728,000 (33%) from
the prior year's interest expense of $2,236,000.  This decrease was largely
attributable to lower borrowings on the Company's line of credit, a decrease in
interest rates and a decrease in the imputed interest rate associated with earn-
out liabilities relating to the Company's purchase of several merchant
processing businesses.


Income Taxes
________________________________________________________________________

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of taxable income, was 35% and
42% for the years ended May 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The decreased rate
in the current year is primarily due to research and development tax credits.
The Company expects this reduced rate to continue.


Net Income Before Extraordinary Item
_________________________________________________________________________

Net income before extraordinary item for fiscal 1994 was $11,160,000, an
increase of $2,671,000 (31%) from fiscal 1993 net income of $8,489,000.


Extraordinary Item
________________________________________________________________________

The Company reported an extraordinary charge of $1,450,000 (net of income taxes)
in fiscal 1994, representing the settlement cost of a lawsuit brought against
the Company.  See note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

Net Income
________________________________________________________________________

Net income for fiscal 1994 was $9,710,000, an increase of $1,221,000 (14%), as
compared to fiscal 1993 net income of $8,489,000.  Earnings per share for fiscal
1994 were $0.75, an increase of $0.07 (10%) from last year.  The weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding for fiscal
1994 was 12,987,000, an increase of 453,000 (4%) as compared to fiscal 1993.

Overview
________________________________________________________________________

Revenue

Total revenue for fiscal 1993 was $204,556,000, a decrease of $11,930,000 (6%)
from revenue of $216,486,000 for the previous year.  The reduction was due
principally to two factors.  The decision to exit the Communication Services
business caused a decline in revenue of $7,593,000 from the prior fiscal year.
Also, the Integrated Payment Systems business was impacted by the shift from
voice to electronic authorization, as well as price trends on new transactions
in the indirect business, resulting in a decline in revenue of $7,981,000.
These decreases were offset by an increase of $8,533,000 in the
Health Care Application Systems and Services business principally due to
increased electronic claims transaction volume.  A more detailed discussion of
the business unit results follows.

Integrated Payment Systems (IPS) revenue for fiscal 1993 was $113,793,000, a
decrease of $7,981,000 (7%) from revenue of $121,774,000 for the prior year,
with the decline occurring principally in the indirect (distribution through
banks) side of the business.  The indirect business represented approximately
50% of total IPS revenues.

Direct revenue decreased $2,007,000 (3%); however, transaction volumes processed
increased by 12% and terminal sales and fees increased as well.  Increased
transaction volume had a favorable revenue impact of $5,104,000, primarily as a
result of improved sales productivity. Terminal sales and other fees increased
$440,000. These increases were offset by a reduction in the prices charged to
merchants of $7,550,000, or approximately 15%, along with a shift from paper
to electronic-based processing.

Indirect revenue decreased $5,974,000 (10%).  Voice authorization revenue
decreased $2,608,000 (21%) and electronic authorization and data capture revenue
decreased $3,367,000 (7%).  The decrease in voice authorization revenue is
attributable to a continued shift of business to electronic authorizations due
to lower prices to the merchants and a higher quality of service.  Voice
authorization processing volume declined approximately 20% in the period and
represents 9% of the total IPS revenue.  The decrease in electronic
authorization and data capture revenue was primarily the result of price
reductions of 10%. The number of electronic authorization and data capture
transactions processed were essentially the same in both periods.



Health Care Application Systems and Services (HCASS) revenue for fiscal 1993 was
$56,268,000, an increase of $8,533,000 (18%) from revenue of $47,735,000 for the
prior year.

Electronic Claims Processing revenue increased $5,173,000 (36%).  This increase
was the result of a 48% increase in claims processed for the current customer
base and new customers. Pharmacy/Dental Practice Management Systems revenue
increased $3,442,000 (14%) in fiscal 1993.  This was primarily the result of
increased sales of the microcomputer-based pharmacy and dental practice
management systems (DataStat) and an increase in recurring maintenance revenue
associated with the growing installed customer base. Revenue from sales to
government and institutional customers decreased $82,000 (1%), primarily as a
result of decreased turnkey systems sales to institutional customers and overall
reductions in defense department spending.


Government and Corporate Information Systems and Services revenue
for fiscal 1993 was $21,549,000, a decrease of $3,218,000 (13%) from revenue of
$24,767,000 for the prior year.  Reduced demand for cash management services in
a period of low interest rates and a trend toward movement of these services to
in-house, microcomputer-based systems are largely responsible for these
reductions.

Other revenue for fiscal 1993 was $12,946,000, a decrease of $9,264,000 (42%)
from revenue of $22,210,000 for the prior year.  This decrease was primarily the
result of the Company's decision to exit the communication services market in
1991. Weak economies in Europe and Japan and the same cash management demand
trends noted previously are the primary causes of the revenue decline in the
International business.


Cost and Expenses
________________________________________________________________________

Total cost of service was $122,537,000 for fiscal 1993.  This was a decrease of
$8,032,000 (6%) from last year.  This decrease was largely the result of a
reduction in cost of operations of $11,100,000 (10%), consisting principally of
payroll and telecommunications cost reductions.  Hardware costs increased
$2,700,000 (32%), directly related to volume associated with sales of healthcare
practice management systems and point-of-sale terminal devices in the retail
market.  Depreciation and amortization expense was essentially flat at
approximately $16,000,000 in both periods.

Gross Margin realized for each year was 40%.

Sales, general and administrative expense was $66,998,000 for fiscal 1993.  This
is a decrease of $4,244,000 (6%) from the prior year. The decrease was the
result of cost containment programs focused on elimination of redundancy and
non-essential activities.  The programs were initiated in the second quarter of
fiscal 1993.  As a percentage of revenue, sales, general and administrative
expenses for fiscal 1993 and 1992 were 33% in both periods.


Investment and Other Income
________________________________________________________________________

Investment and other income for fiscal 1993 was $1,851,000, a decrease of
$461,000 (20%) below the prior year of $2,312,000.  This decrease was
principally a decrease in interest income.  The lower interest income resulted
from the Company's sale of its pharmacy and dental systems lease portfolio in
fiscal 1993.


Interest Expense, net
________________________________________________________________________

Net interest expense for 1993 was $2,236,000, a decrease of $1,960,000
(47%) from the prior year's interest expense of $4,196,000.  This decrease was
largely attributable to lower borrowings on the Company's line of credit, a
decrease in interest rates and a decrease in the imputed interest rate
associated with earn-out liabilities relating to the Company's purchase of
several merchant processing businesses.


Income Taxes
________________________________________________________________________

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of taxable income, was 42% for
both periods.

Net Income
________________________________________________________________________

Net income for fiscal 1993 was $8,489,000, an increase of $1,070,000 (14%), as
compared to fiscal 1992 net income of $7,419,000.  Earnings per share for fiscal
1993 were $0.68, an increase of $0.06 (10%) from last year.  The weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding for fiscal
1993 was 12,534,000, an increase of 505,000 (4%) as compared to fiscal 1992.






Analysis of Financial Position
_______________________________________________________________________


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $38,632,000 in fiscal 1994, an
increase of $5,681,000 (17%), compared to the prior year of $32,951,000.  The
improvement is principally related to a reduction in accounts
receivable balances as a result of increased emphasis placed on asset
management.

Cash used in investing activities was $10,291,000 compared to cash provided by
investing activities of $15,463,000 in the prior year.  In fiscal 1994, the
Company made investments in capital assets of approximately $15,357,000 as
compared to $8,237,000 in fiscal 1993. Last year the Company generated
approximately $19,257,000 in cash by selling a majority of its' lease portfolio.

Net cash used in financing activities was $7,433,000, a decrease of $26,203,000
from the prior year.  Proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees
increased $1,754,000 in the current year.  In addition, payments of $24,500,000
were made by the Company to pay-off its line of credit and note payable in
fiscal 1993.  No borrowings were made against the line of credit in fiscal 1994.
Dividends of approximately $5,500,000 and $5,300,000 were paid in fiscal 1994
and 1993, respectively.

Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into a $15,000,000 committed,
working capital line of credit with two banks expiring in August 1995.  The
Company believes funds generated from operations along with its committed line
of credit and the $38,012,000 cash on hand will be adequate to meet normal
business operating needs.  In addition to the working capital line of credit,
the Company obtained a committed $40,000,000 acquisition line of credit which
expires in August of 1996.



Stockholders' Equity

Stockholders' equity increased $8,070,000 (8%), from May 31, 1993 to
$109,331,000 at May 31, 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
_____________________________________________________________

Principles of consolidation - The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue - Revenue from major software license agreements is
recognized upon installation.  Revenue associated with the
Company's government cost-plus contracts and all other
revenue is recognized as work is completed or services are
performed.

Other receivables - Other receivables consist primarily of
reimbursable amounts associated with the merchant processing
operation.

Inventory - Inventory, which is composed primarily of
microcomputer hardware and peripheral equipment and
electronic point-of-sale terminals, is stated at lower of
cost or market.  Cost is determined by using the first-in,
first-out method.

Investment in sales-type leases - The Company's leasing
operations consist principally of noncancelable leases of
computer equipment and software, generally covering five
years.  Accordingly, the present value of all payments due
under the lease contract is recorded as revenue at the
inception of the lease and shipment of the equipment.
Interest income is recorded over the lease term (see also
Note 7).

Property and equipment - Property and equipment is stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and
primarily accelerated methods for tax purposes.  Equipment is
depreciated over two-to five-year lives, and the building is
depreciated over a 40-year life.  Leasehold improvements and
property acquired under capital leases are amortized over the
shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the
lease.  The costs of purchased and internally developed
software used to provide services to customers or internal
administrative services are capitalized and amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, up to
five years. Work in Progress consists of capital projects
currently under development (see also Note 8).


Acquired intangibles and goodwill -  Acquired intangibles
primarily represent customer contracts and covenants-not-to-
compete associated with the Company's acquisitions.  Acquired
intangibles are amortized using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives of 4 to 20 years.  Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over
the fair market value of their tangible and identifiable net
assets.  Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis
predominantly over 20 years. Subsequent to an acquisition,
the Company regularly evaluates whether events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount
of goodwill may warrant revision or may not be recoverable.
When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the
future undiscounted net cash flows of the related businesses
over the remaining life of the goodwill in measuring whether
the goodwill is recoverable (see also Note 2).

Income taxes - The Company files income tax returns on the
accrual basis.  Deferred income taxes are provided for all
timing differences in reporting transactions for financial
reporting and income tax purposes (see also Note 3).

Earn-out payables - Earn-out payables represent the present
value of estimated future payments under the earn-out
agreements related to the Company's business acquisitions
(see also Note 2).

Foreign currency translation - The financial statements of
foreign subsidiaries have been remeasured from their
functional currency into U.S. dollars in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52.

Cash and cash equivalents - For purposes of reporting cash
flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
unrestricted amounts deposited with banks.

Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made
to the fiscal 1993 and 1992 consolidated financial statements
to conform to the fiscal 1994 presentation.

Earnings per common share -  Earnings per common and common
equivalent share on a primary basis are computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares
and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Common equivalent shares represent stock options that, if
exercised, would have a dilutive effect on earnings per
share.  All options with an exercise price less than the
average market share price for the period are assumed to have
a dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Earnings per common and common equivalent share on a fully
diluted basis are computed by the same method as described
for primary earnings per share except that the higher of
(1) the ending market share price or (2) the average market
share price is used to compute the fully diluted earnings per
share, as compared to the average market share price for
primary earnings per share.

The primary and fully diluted weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding is as follows
(in thousands):


                                    Year Ended May 31,
                               1994        1993      1992

Primary                       12,987      12,534    12,029

Fully Diluted                 12,987      12,535    12,029



Note 2 - Business Acquisitions
_____________________________________________________________

During fiscal year 1992, the Company acquired the merchant
credit card processing contracts of Signet Bank for
$9,395,000.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase;
accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired
business from the date of acquisition, which were not
material, have been included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. The purchase consisted of a single cash
payment.

For all portfolios acquired, the acquired assets and
liabilities, including the acquired intangibles and
liabilities for earn-out payments (if any), were originally
recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements
based on preliminary estimates of their fair market values at
the date of acquisition.  These estimates are revised as
necessary upon final appraisal of the acquired assets,
primarily acquired intangibles, and determination of actual
earn-out payments, if any.  During fiscal 1994 and fiscal
1993, the purchase price and earn-out liabilities related to
prior fiscal year acquisitions were increased by $564,000 and
reduced by $770,000, respectively, to reflect actual earn-out
payments and current estimates of future earn-out payments.
In addition, the Company increased interest expense by
$230,000 and reduced interest expense by $278,000 in fiscal
1994 and 1993, respectively, to adjust accrued interest on
earn-out liabilities based on revised estimates.

The changes in acquired intangibles and goodwill for fiscal
years 1994 and 1993 are summarized below (in thousands):

Balance at May 31, 1992                         $53,264

Note 4 - Stockholder's Equity
_____________________________________________________________

Stock Option Plans - The Company had two employee option
plans at May 31, 1994, the 1982 Incentive Stock Option Plan
(1982 Plan) and the 1987 Stock Option Plan (1987 Plan).  All
stock option plans in existence in prior years were
terminated upon adoption of the 1987 Plan.  The 1982 and 1987
Plans provide for granting options, to certain officers and
key employees, to purchase the Company's common stock at
prices not less than fair market value at the time of grant.
Options granted become exercisable in various annual
increments and terminate over a period not to exceed six
years for the 1982 Plan and ten years for the 1987 Plan.

Transactions in stock options under these plans are
summarized as follows:

                                               Option Price
                              Shares Under       Per Share

- - -------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding at May 31, 1994    1,481,925     $8.00 - $33.75


At May 31, 1994, there were 643,783 shares available for
future grants under the 1987 Plan and no shares available for
grant under the 1982 Plan.

Other Stock Plans -  The Company has an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan under which the sale of 600,000 shares of its
common stock has been authorized.  Employees may designate up
to the lesser of $25,000 or 20% of their annual compensation
for the purchase of stock.  The price for shares purchased
under the plan is the lower of 85% of market value on the
first day or the last day of the purchase period.  At May 31,
1994, 564,106 shares have been issued under this plan with
35,894 shares reserved for future issuance.


The Company also has a Non-employee Directors Stock Option
Plan which provides for grants of options, consisting of
5,000 shares of the Company's common stock for each completed
year of service, to directors who are not employees of the
Company.  A maximum of five options may be granted to each
such director, and the maximum number of shares for which
options may be granted is 230,000.  The options are
exercisable immediately at the current market value on the
date of grant.  During fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
options for 25,000, 25,000 and 30,000 shares, respectively,
were issued under the Plan and none were exercised.  As of
May 31, 1994, 35,000 shares were available for future grants.

The Company's 1983 Restricted Stock Plan (Restricted Plan)
authorizes 325,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be
awarded to key employees.  Shares awarded under the
Restricted Plan are held in escrow and released to the
grantee upon the grantee's satisfaction of conditions of
the grantee's restricted stock agreement.  Awards are
recorded as deferred compensation, a reduction of
stockholder's equity based on the quoted fair market value of
the Company's common stock at the award date.  Compensation
expense is recognized ratably during the escrow period of the
award.

During fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, 49,500, 109,000 and
10,000 shares, respectively, of the Company's common stock
were awarded under the Restricted Plan with restriction
periods of one to four years.  As of May 31, 1994,  122,167
shares remain in escrow.  There were 56,500 shares reserved
for future issuance under this plan.  The Company expensed
$744,000, $391,000 and $327,000 for the years ended May 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, in connection with the
Restricted Plan.

The Company's 1984 Employee Stock Ownership Plan was
dissolved in fiscal year 1993, and all shares escrowed were
distributed to eligible employees.  At May 31, 1994, no
shares remain in escrow to be distributed to employees.


Note 5 - Pension Plan:
_____________________________________________________________

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all of its United States
employees who have met the eligibility provisions of the
plan.  Benefits are based on years of service and the
employee's compensation during the highest five consecutive
years of earnings of the last ten years of service.  Plan
provisions and funding meet the requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

                                 ============================

Significant assumptions used in determining net pension
expense (benefit) and related obligations were as follows:

                                              May 31,
                                         1994        1993
Discount rate                            7.75%       8.25%
Rate of increase in compensation
 levels                                  4.33%       4.00%
Expected long-term rate of
 return on assets                       10.00%      10.00%

The Company terminated 339 and 158 employees in fiscal 1994
and 1993, respectively.  These terminations were accounted
for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 88, "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination Benefits," and the resulting curtailment loss of
$66,000 and $89,000 in the years ended May 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, is included in the net pension expense.

On December 18, 1991, the Company adopted a retirement plan
for non-employee directors of the Company with five or more
years of service (The Directors' Plan).  The Directors' Plan
benefits are based on 50% of the annual Director retainer
amount in effect on the date of a director's retirement
plus 10% for each year of service up to 100% of the base
amount for ten years' service.  The benefits are payable upon
retirement, at or after age 70, for a period equal to the
number of years of service as a Director but not more than 15
years for participants with 15 or more years of Board Service
as of the effective date of the Directors' Plan and not more
than 10 years for all other participants.  The expense
related to the Directors' Plan was immaterial in both fiscal
1994 and 1993.

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 112, "Employer's Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits."  This statement requires the
accrual of the expected cost of such benefits during the
employees' years of service.  Adoption of this statement is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.
The new standard will not have a material effect on the
Company's results of operations or financial position.




Note 6 - Lease Obligations
- - -------------------------------------------------------------

The Company conducts a major part of its operations using
leased facilities and equipment.  Many of these leases have
renewal and purchase options and provide that the Company pay
the cost of property taxes, insurance and maintenance.

Rent expense on all operating leases for fiscal years 1994,
1993 and 1992 was $4,392,000, $5,128,000 and $5,488,000,
respectively.

In fiscal 1994 and 1993, the Company sold approximately
$11,903,000 and $21,831,000, respectively, of its sales-type
leases to a third party.  These sales have been reflected as
reductions in the above investment balances.  The related
gains, which were not material, have been recorded as other
income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Under the terms of the sales, the purchaser has recourse to
the Company should certain amounts of the leases prove to be
uncollectible.  For the majority of the leases, this recourse
is limited to 20% of the outstanding balance of leases sold;
however, certain leases were sold with full recourse.  The
anticipated loss on the maximum recourse amount of $5,413,000
and $ 5,183,000 at May 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, is
not material and is included in other current liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At May 31, 1994, the future minimum lease payments scheduled
to be received in each of the five succeeding years and
thereafter were as follows (in thousands):

                                         ===========


The carrying amount approximates its fair value because the
interest rate on the mortgage approximates the current market
rates.


Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies
____________________________________________________________

The Company and certain of its previous officers were party
to three lawsuits, which were consolidated as "National Data
Corporation Shareholder Litigation."  The plaintiffs,
purporting to act on behalf of a class, alleged violations
of rule 10(b)(5) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
under a "fraud on the market" theory for alleged
misrepresentations and omissions relating to expected
earnings which resulted in, the plaintiffs contend, the
Company's common stock being overvalued in the market.  The
Company and the plaintiffs signed an agreement on September
27, 1993 to settle this matter for $6,950,000.  The Company's
insurer bore two-thirds of the settlement and related future
costs.  The cost to the Company, net of income taxes and
insurance proceeds, was approximately $1,450,000.  Both the
Company and its insurer paid their full share of the
settlement amount on December 1, 1993, and the settlement
received final approval from the court on December 16, 1993.

The Company is party to a number of other claims and lawsuits
incidental to its business.  In the opinion of management,
the ultimate outcome of such matters, in the aggregate, will
not have a material adverse impact upon the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into a
$15,000,000 committed line of credit with two banks to fund
the Company's working capital requirements.  In addition, the
Company obtained a two-year $40,000,000 line of credit for
acquisitions.  Borrowings under these agreements bear
interest at the prime rate less 1% and the prime rate,
respectively.  The lines of credit are not secured.  The
agreements require the Company to maintain certain financial
ratios and contain other restrictive covenants.  The working
capital line of credit expires in August 1995, and the
acquisition line of credit expires in August 1996.

As of May 31, 1994, the Company processed credit card
transactions for approximately 80,000 direct merchant locations.
The annual volumes processed for each customer range from
approximately $2,000 to $1 billion.  The Company's merchant
customers have liability for charges disputed by cardholders.
However, in the case of merchant fraud, or insolvency or
bankruptcy of the merchant, the Company may be liable for any
of such charges disputed by cardholders.  The Company
requires cash deposits and other types of collateral by
certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability.
In addition,  the Company believes that the diversification
of its merchant portfolio among industries and geographic
regions minimizes its risk of loss.  Based on its historical
loss experience, the Company has established reserves for
estimated losses on transactions processed through May 31,
1994.  In the opinion of management, such reserves for losses
are adequate.

In connection with the Company's acquisition of merchant
credit card operations of banks, the Company has also entered
into depository and processing agreements ("the Agreements")
with certain of the banks.  These Agreements allow the
Company to use the banks' "Bank Identification Number"
to clear credit card transactions through VISA and
MasterCard.  Certain of the Agreements contain financial
covenants, and the Company was in compliance with all such
covenants as of May 31, 1994.


Note 11 - Information on Major Customers and Foreign
          Operations:

_____________________________________________________________

The Company operates principally in data processing services
and provides specialized data processing applications
designed to meet the business needs of its customers.  The
applications include a variety of Healthcare Application
Systems and Services, Integrated Payment Systems and
Government and Corporate Information Systems and Services.

The Company markets its products internationally and has
sales offices in Canada, Europe and Japan.  Revenue from non-
U.S. operations was $4,873,000, $6,077,000 and $7,748,000 for
the years ended May 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Operating losses from foreign operations were $449,000,
$2,102,000, and $1,061,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Assets related to foreign operations are not
significant.

Approximately 4%, 5% and 5% of the Company's total revenue
for the years ended May 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, was derived from contracts with, or as a
subcontractor of contractors with, the United States
government.  All such contracts and subcontracts are
generally subject to termination at the convenience of the
United States government, whenever it believes that such
termination would be in its best interests.  If such
contracts and subcontracts were terminated for the
convenience of the United States government, the Company is
generally entitled to receive payment for work completed and
allowable termination costs.



Note 12 - Subsequent Events
____________________________________________________________


In June 1994, the assets and certain liabilities of Yes
Check, Inc., were acquired.  Yes Check, Inc. is a Chicago-
based check guarantee company with 49 employees. On July 15,
1994, the Company acquired the assets and certain liabilities
of Lytec Systems, Inc., a Salt Lake City company that
develops and markets medical practice management software
with 10 employees. The combined estimated annual revenues for
these acquired companies is $8,000,000.

Both acquisitions require earn-out payments at future dates
that are not estimable at this time.  The aggregate price
paid for these acquisitions was $9,150,000.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS AS TO SCHEDULES



We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the financial statements included in National Data
Corporation's annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in
this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated July 15, 1994.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed in the index above
are the responsibility of the company's management and are presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and are not part of the basic financial statements.  These
schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
state in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

                           ARTICLE II

                           THE CREDITS

         SECTION 2.01. Commitments to Lend.  Each Bank severally
agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, to make
Loans as follows:


         From time to time prior to the Termination Date, each
Bank shall make Loans to the Borrower in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding which shall not exceed its
Commitment.  Each (i) Euro-Dollar Borrowing under this Section
2.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or
any larger multiple of $500,000 and (ii) Base Rate Borrowing
under this Section 2.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount
of $500,000 or any larger multiple of $500,000, (except that any
such Euro-Dollar or Base Rate Borrowing may be in any lesser
amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Unused Commitments)
and shall be made from the several Banks ratably in accordance
with their respective Commitments.  Within the foregoing limits,
the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, repay or, to the
extent permitted by Section 2.09, prepay Loans and reborrow under
this Section 2.01 at any time before the Termination Date.

         SECTION 2.02. Method of Borrowing.  (a) The Borrower
shall give the Agent notice (a "Notice of Borrowing"), which
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit E, on the same day
(before 10:30 A.M., Atlanta, Georgia time) for each Base Rate
Borrowing, and at least 3 Euro-Dollar Business Days before each
Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying:

         (i)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
    Domestic Business Day in the case of a Domestic Borrowing or
    a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar
    Borrowing,

         (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,

         (iii) whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to
    be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, and

         (iv) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the
    duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject
    to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

         (b)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing the Agent
shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of
such Bank's ratable share of such Borrowing and such Notice of
Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

         (c) Not later than 1:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on
the date of each Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided
in paragraph (d) of this Section) make available its ratable
share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately
available in Atlanta, Georgia, to the Agent at its address
referred to in Section 9.01.  Unless the Agent determines that
any applicable condition specified in Article III has not been
satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from the
Banks available to the Borrower by 4:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia
time) on the date of a Borrowing at the Agent's aforesaid
address.  Unless the Agent receives notice from a Bank, at the
Agent's address referred to in or specified pursuant to Section
9.01, no later than 12:00 P.M. (local time at such address) on
the date of a Borrowing stating that such Bank will not make a
Loan in connection with such Borrowing, the Agent shall be
entitled to assume that such Bank will make a Loan in connection
with such Borrowing and, in reliance on such assumption, the
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make available such
Bank's ratable share of such Borrowing to the Borrower for the
account of such Bank.  If the Agent makes such Bank's ratable
share available to the Borrower and such Bank does not in fact
make its ratable share of such Borrowing available on such date,
the Agent shall be entitled to recover such Bank's ratable share
from such Bank or the Borrower (and for such purpose shall be
entitled to charge such amount to any account of the Borrower
maintained with the Agent), together with interest thereon for
each day during the period from the date of such Borrowing until
such sum shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate for each such day during such period, provided
that any such payment by the Borrower of such Bank's ratable
share and interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any
rights that the Borrower may have against such Bank.  If the
Agent does not exercise its option to advance funds for the
account of such Bank, it shall forthwith notify the Borrower of
such decision.

         (d) If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on
which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding
Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its
new Loan to make such repayment and only an amount equal to the
difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the
amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank to the
Agent as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section, or remitted
by the Borrower to the Agent as provided in Section 2.11, as the
case may be.

         (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no Euro-Dollar Borrowing may be made if there
shall have occurred a Default or an Event of Default, which
Default or Event of Default shall not have been cured or waived.

         (f) In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to
specify whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be
Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, such Loans shall be made as
Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower is otherwise entitled under
this Agreement to repay any Loans maturing at the end of an
Interest Period applicable thereto with the proceeds of a new
Borrowing, and the Borrower fails to repay such Loans using its
own moneys and fails to give a Notice of Borrowing in connection
with such new Borrowing, a new Borrowing shall be deemed to be
made on the date such Loans mature (in accordance with Section
2.04) in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Loans so
maturing, and the Loans comprising such new Borrowing shall be
Base Rate Loans.


         (g)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, there shall not be more than 8 interest rates (including
the Applicable Margins) applicable to the Loans at any given
time.

         SECTION 2.03. Notes.  (a) The Loans of each Bank shall
be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of such Bank
for the account of its Lending Office in an amount equal to the
original principal amount of such Bank's Commitment.

         (b) Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to Section
3.01, the Agent shall mail such Note to such Bank.  Each Bank
shall record, and prior to any transfer of each of its Notes
shall endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate
notations to evidence, the date, amount and maturity of each Loan
made by it, the date and amount of each payment of principal made
by the Borrower with respect thereto and whether such Loan is a
Base Rate Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, and such schedule shall
constitute rebuttable presumptive evidence of the principal
amount owing and unpaid on such Bank's Notes; provided that the
failure of any Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement
shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder or
under the Notes.  Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by
the Borrower so to endorse its Notes and to attach to and make a
part of any Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when
required.

         SECTION 2.04. Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan included in
any Borrowing shall mature, and the principal amount thereof
shall be due and payable, on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable to such Borrowing.  The entire principal balance of
the Loans, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon,
shall be due and payable on the Termination Date.

         SECTION 2.05. Interest Rates.  (a) "Applicable Margin"
means:

              (i)  for any Base Rate Loan, 0.0%, and

              (ii) for any Euro-Dollar Loan, 0.75%.

         (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date
such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable Margin.  Such
interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last
day thereof.  Any overdue principal of and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, overdue interest on any Base Rate
Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until
paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

         (c) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted London Interbank
Offered Rate for such Interest Period; provided that if any
Euro-Dollar Loan shall, as a result of paragraph (1)(c) of the
definition of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less
than 1 month, such Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest during
such Interest Period at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans
during such period.  Any overdue principal of and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall
bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a
rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

         The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable
to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the
quotient obtained (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next
higher 1/16th of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period by (ii) 1.00
minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

         The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Euro-Dollar Loan means for the Interest Period of such
Euro-Dollar Loan, the rate per annum determined on the basis of
the offered rate for deposits in Dollars of amounts equal or
comparable to the principal amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan
offered for a term comparable to such Interest Period, which
rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00 A.M.,
London time, 2 Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the first day
of such Interest Period, provided that (i) if more than one such
offered rate appears on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, the "London
Interbank Offered Rate" will be the arithmetic average (rounded
upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16th of 1%) of such
offered rates; (ii) if no such offered rates appear on such page,
the "London Interbank Offered Rate" for such Interest Period will
be the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the
next higher 1/16th of 1%) of rates quoted by not less than two
major banks in New York City, selected by the Agent, at
approximately 10:00 A.M., New York City time, 2 Euro-Dollar
Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period, for
deposits in Dollars offered to leading European banks for a term
comparable to such Interest Period in an amount equal or
comparable to the principal amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan.

         "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such
day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum
reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve
System in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of
any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by
reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other
assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any
Bank to United States residents).


         (d) The Agent shall determine each interest rate
applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt
notice to the Borrower and the Banks by telecopier, telex or
cable of each rate of interest so determined, and its
determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error.

         SECTION 2.06. Fees.  (a) The Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee calculated at
the rate of 0.375% per annum on the total amount of the
Commitments (without regard to the outstanding principal amount
of the Loans).  Such facility fees shall accrue from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the Termination Date
and shall be payable, in arrears, on each March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31, and on the Termination Date.

         (b)  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the
account and sole benefit of the Agent, on the Closing Date

thereafter, and on the Termination Date, a fully earned and non-
refundable administrative fee in the amount of $2,500 per
calendar quarter (or portion thereof) occurring prior to the
Termination Date.

         SECTION 2.07. Optional Termination or Reduction of the
Commitments.  The Borrower may, upon at least 3 Domestic Business
Days' notice to the Agent, terminate at any  time, or
proportionately reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount
of at least $1,000,000, the Commitments.  If the Commitments are
terminated in their entirety, all accrued fees (as provided under
Section 2.06) shall be due and payable on the effective date of
such termination and shall not thereafter accrue.

         SECTION 2.08. Mandatory Reduction and Termination of
Commitments.  The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination
Date and any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued
interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

         SECTION 2.09. Optional Prepayments.  (a) The Borrower
may, on any Domestic Business Day, by notice to the Agent prior
to 10:30 A.M. on such date, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing in
whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts
aggregating at least $500,000, by paying the principal amount to
be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to
prepay ratably the Base Rate Loans of the several Banks included
in such Base Rate Borrowing.

         (b)  Subject to Section 8.05, the Borrower may, on any
Euro-Dollar Business Day, by notice to the Agent prior to 10:30
A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on such date, prepay any Euro-Dollar
Loan in whole at any time, or from time to time in part, prior to
the maturity thereof, in amounts aggregating at least $1,000,000
(except that any such prepayment may be in any lesser amount
equal to the entire outstanding balance of any relevant Euro-
Dollar Loan), by paying the principal amount to be prepaid
together with accrued interest thereon to the date of the
prepayment.

         (c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to
this Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the
contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such
prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by
the Borrower.

         SECTION 2.10. Mandatory Prepayments.  (a) On each date
on which the Commitments are reduced pursuant to Section 2.07 or
Section 2.08, the Borrower shall repay or prepay such principal
amount of the outstanding Loans, if any (together with interest
accrued thereon), as may be necessary so that after such payment
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans does not
exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as then reduced.

         (b)  Each and every calendar month during the term of
this Agreement, the Borrower shall repay or prepay the Loans to
the extent necessary to cause the aggregate outstanding principal
balance of the Loans to be not greater than $3,000,000 for a
period of not less than 5 consecutive calendar days.

         SECTION 2.11. General Provisions as to Payments.
(a)The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and
interest on, the Loans and of facility fees hereunder, not later
than 10:30 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date when due, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia,
to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01.  The
Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of
each such payment received by the Agent for the account of the
Banks.

         (b)  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest
on, the Base Rate Loans or of facility fees shall be due on a day
which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic
Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of or interest
on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless

which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next
preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.

good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its

constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower
enforceable in accordance with its terms, and the Notes and the
other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party, when

enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, provided
that the enforceability hereof and thereof is subject in each
case to general principles of equity and to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, and similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

         SECTION 4.04. Financial Information.  (a) The
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Consolidated

in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, is qualified to transact business in every
jurisdiction set forth in Schedule 4.08 and the failure of any
such Subsidiary Guarantor to be so qualified in any other
jurisdictions could not reasonably be expected to have or cause a
Material Adverse Effect, and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except where
the failure to have any such licenses, authorizations, consents
and approvals could not reasonably be expected to have or cause a
Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower has no Subsidiaries except
for those Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.08, which accurately

Borrower, after due inquiry, which could reasonably be expected
to have or cause a Material Adverse Effect.

at, on, in or under the Properties, or, to the best of the
knowledge of the Borrower, without independent inquiry, at or
from any adjacent site or facility, except for Hazardous
Materials used, produced, manufactured, processed, treated,

clear of any Lien or adverse claim.

         SECTION 4.15. Margin Stock.  Neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying
any Margin Stock, and no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be
used to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit to
others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin
Stock, or be used for any purpose which violates, or which is
inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation X.

ability to perform under any of the Loan Documents, (d) so long
as no Default shall be in existence either immediately prior to
or following any asset disposition, the Borrower may sell or
otherwise dispose of (x) any of its equipment lease and software
license agreements and (y) any of its other assets in an amount
of up to $10,000,000 in fair market value during each consecutive
12 month period and (e) during the existence of a Default which
does not constitute an Event of Default, the Borrower may
continue to sell equipment leases and software license agreements
to Sanwa on the same terms on which such sales customarily were
consummated prior to such Default.

         SECTION 5.12. Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the
Loans shall be used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes.  No portion of the proceeds of the Loans will
be used by the Borrower (i) in connection with any tender offer
for, or other acquisition of, stock of any corporation with a
view towards obtaining control of such other corporation, (ii)
directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate,
incidental or ultimate, of purchasing or carrying any Margin
Stock, or (iii) for any purpose in violation of any applicable
law or regulation.

         SECTION 5.13. Compliance with Laws; Payment of Taxes.
The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and
each member of the Controlled Group to, comply in all material
respects with applicable laws (including but not limited to
ERISA), regulations and similar requirements of governmental
authorities (including but not limited to PBGC), except where the
necessity of such compliance is being contested in good faith
through appropriate proceedings.  The Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay, prior to the accrual of
any penalty in respect thereof, all taxes, assessments,
governmental charges, claims for labor, supplies, rent and other
obligations which, if unpaid, might become a Lien against the
property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except liabilities
being contested in good faith and against which, if reasonably
requested by the Agent, the Borrower will set up reserves in
accordance with GAAP.

         SECTION 5.14. Insurance.  The Borrower will maintain,
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain (either in
the name of the Borrower or in such Subsidiary's own name), with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance on
all its property in at least such amounts and against at least
such risks as are usually insured against in the same general
area by companies of established repute engaged in the same or
similar business.


         SECTION 5.15. Change in Fiscal Year.  The Borrower will
not change its Fiscal Year without the consent of the Required
Banks, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         SECTION 5.16. Maintenance of Property.  The Borrower
shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, maintain all of its
properties and assets in good condition, repair and working
order, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

         SECTION 5.17. Environmental Notices.  Upon obtaining
knowledge thereof, the Borrower shall furnish to the Banks and
the Agent prompt written notice of all Environmental Liabilities,
pending, threatened or anticipated Environmental Proceedings,
Environmental Notices, Environmental Judgments and Orders, and
Environmental Releases at, on, in, under or in any way affecting
the Properties or any adjacent property, and all facts, events,
or conditions that could lead to any of the foregoing if any of
the foregoing could reasonably be expected to have or cause a
Material Adverse Effect; provided, that should the Borrower or
any Subsidiary receive any written notice with respect to any of
the foregoing, then the Borrower shall provide the Banks and the
Agent with a copy of same, regardless of whether the facts,
events or conditions described therein might have or cause a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.18. Environmental Matters.  The Borrower will
not, and will not permit any Third Party to, use, produce,
manufacture, process, treat, recycle, generate, store, dispose
of, manage at, or otherwise handle, or ship or transport to or
from the Properties any Hazardous Materials except for Hazardous
Materials used, produced, manufactured, processed, treated,
recycled, generated, stored, disposed, managed, or otherwise
handled in the ordinary course of business in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Environmental Requirements.

         SECTION 5.19. Environmental Release.  The Borrower
agrees that upon the occurrence of an Environmental Release it
will act promptly to investigate the extent of, and to take
appropriate remedial action to remedy, such Environmental
Release, to the extent required by any applicable Environmental
Requirement or any Environmental Judgment and Order.

         SECTION 5.20. Future Subsidiaries.  The Borrower shall
cause all of its Subsidiaries not existing as of the date hereof
to execute and deliver Subsidiary Guaranties, and other Loan
Documents related thereto, as requested by the Agent, within 25
Business Days of the creation or acquisition of any such
Subsidiary by the Borrower.  The delivery of such documents and
instruments shall be accompanied by such other documents as the
Agent may reasonably request (e.g., certificates of
incorporation, articles of incorporation and bylaws, opinion
letters, and appropriate resolutions of the Board of Directors of
any such Subsidiary Guarantor).

         (f) an "Event of Default" shall occur under any of the
    other Loan Documents; provided, that, should any such "Event
    of Default" be waived by the Banks, then, such waiver shall
    operate as a waiver of an Event of Default arising under this
    Section 6.01(f) as a result of same; or

         (g) any event or condition shall occur which results in
    the acceleration of the maturity of Debt outstanding of the

    general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall
    fail generally to pay its debts as they become due, or shall
    take any corporate action to authorize any of the foregoing;
    or

         (i)  an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be

    any member of the Controlled Group, any plan administrator or

    of ERISA and such proceeding shall not have been dismissed
    within 30 days thereafter; or a condition shall exist by
    reason of which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree
    adjudicating that any such Plan or Plans must be terminated;
    or the Borrower or any other member of the Controlled Group
    shall enter into, contribute or be obligated to contribute
    to, terminate or incur any withdrawal liability with respect
    to, a Multiemployer Plan; provided, that no Default or Event

    or

         (k)  one or more judgments or orders for the payment of

    corresponding date of the previous year, (B) selected or
    nominated to become directors by the Board of Directors of
    the Borrower of which a majority consisted of individuals
    described in clause (A), or (C) selected or nominated to
    become directors by the Board of Directors of the Borrower of
    which a majority consisted of individuals described in clause
    (A) and individuals described in clause (B); or

         (n)  the occurrence of any event, act, occurrence, or
    condition which the Banks determine either does or has a
    reasonable probability of causing a Material Adverse Effect;
    or

         (o)  (i) any of the Subsidiary Guaranties shall cease to
    be enforceable or (ii) the Borrower or any Subsidiary
    Guarantor shall assert that any Loan Document is not
    enforceable; or

         (p)  an "Event of Default" shall occur under the
    Acquisition Credit Agreement; provided, that, should any such

    shall operate as a waiver of an Event of Default arising
    under this Section 6.01(p) as a result of same.

then, and in every such event, the Agent shall, if requested by
the Required Banks, (i) by notice to the Borrower terminate the
Commitments and they shall thereupon terminate, and (ii) by
notice to the Borrower declare the Notes (together with accrued
interest thereon) to be, and the Notes shall thereupon become,
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest
or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
the Borrower together with interest at the Default Rate accruing
on the principal amount thereof from and after the date of such
Event of Default; provided that if any Event of Default specified
in paragraph (h) or (i) above occurs with respect to the
Borrower, without any notice to the Borrower or any other act by
the Agent or the Banks, the Commitments shall thereupon terminate
and the Notes (together with accrued interest thereon) shall
become immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower together with interest thereon at the
Default Rate accruing on the principal amount thereof from and
after the date of such Event of Default.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Agent shall have available to it all other
remedies at law or equity, and shall exercise any one or all of
them at the request of the Required Banks.

         SECTION 6.02. Notice of Default.  The Agent shall give
notice to the Borrower of any Default under Section 6.01(c)
promptly upon being requested to do so by any Bank and shall
thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.


                           ARTICLE VII

                            THE AGENT

         SECTION 7.01. Appointment; Powers and Immunities.  Each
Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act
as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents with
such powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.  The Agent: (a) shall have no
duties or responsibilities except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee for any
Bank; (b) shall not be responsible to the Banks for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or
other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any
Bank under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or
for any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations
hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or
conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or
under any other Loan Document except to the extent requested by
the Required Banks, and then only on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Agent, and (d) shall not be responsible for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under
any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument
referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection
herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.  The Agent may employ agents and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
it with reasonable care.  The provisions of this Article VII are
solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks, and the
Borrower shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary
of any of the provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and
duties under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents,
the Agent shall act solely as agent of the Banks and does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation
towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the
Borrower.  The duties of the Agent shall be ministerial and
administrative in nature, and the Agent shall not have by reason
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Bank.

         SECTION 7.02. Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other
communication (including any thereof by telephone, telefax,
telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and
to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person
or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants or other experts selected by the Agent.
As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, the Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Required
Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks in any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
of the Banks.

         SECTION 7.03. Defaults.  The Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default (other than the nonpayment of principal of or interest on
the Loans) unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or
the Borrower specifying such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".  In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a
Default or an Event of Default, the Agent shall give prompt
notice thereof to the Banks.  The Agent shall give each Bank
prompt notice of each nonpayment of principal of or interest on
the Loans whether or not it has received any notice of the
occurrence of such nonpayment.  The Agent shall (subject to
Section 9.06) take such action hereunder with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the Required
Banks, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have
received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

         SECTION 7.04. Rights of Agent as a Bank.  With respect
to the Loans made by it, Wachovia in its capacity as a Bank
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any
other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not acting
as the Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the
context otherwise indicates, include Wachovia in its individual
capacity.  The Agent may (without having to account therefor to
any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Borrower (and any of its Affiliates) as if it were not acting as
the Agent, and the Agent may accept fees and other consideration
from the Borrower (in addition to any agency fees and arrangement
fees heretofore agreed to between the Borrower and the Agent) for
services in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise without having to account for the same to
the Banks.

         SECTION 7.05. Indemnification.  Each Bank severally
agrees to indemnify the Agent, to the extent the Agent shall not
have been reimbursed by the Borrower, ratably in accordance with
its Commitment, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
(including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements)
or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (excluding, unless an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, the normal administrative costs and expenses
incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or
the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or any such
other documents; provided, however that no Bank shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent.  If any indemnity
furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call
for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the
acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished.

         SECTION 7.06. Payee of Note Treated as Owner.  The Agent
may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for
all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Agent and the provisions of Section 9.08(c) have been satisfied.
Any requests, authority or consent of any Person who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the
holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of that Note or of any
Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor or replacement thereof.

         SECTION 7.07. Nonreliance on Agent and Other Banks.
Each Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance
on the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis of the Borrower and decision to enter into this
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
The Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by the Borrower of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to
or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or
books of the Borrower or any other Person.  Except for notices,
reports and other documents and information expressly required to
be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or
business of the Borrower or any other Person (or any of their
Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent.

         SECTION 7.08. Failure to Act.  Except for action
expressly required of the Agent hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in
failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it
shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction by the Banks
of their indemnification obligations under Section 7.05 against
any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by the
Agent by reason of taking, continuing to take, or failing to take
any such action.

         SECTION 7.09. Resignation or Removal of Agent.  Subject
to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by giving notice
thereof to the Banks and the Borrower and the Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Banks.

Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall
have the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's notice of resignation or the Required Banks'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent.  Any successor
Agent shall be a bank which has a combined capital and surplus of
at least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation or
removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
the Agent hereunder.



                          ARTICLE VIII

              CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; COMPENSATION

         SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate
Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any
Interest Period:

         (a)  the Agent reasonably determines that deposits in
    Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in
    the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

         (b) the Required Banks advise the Agent that the London
    Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be, as determined by
    the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
    such Banks of funding Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest
    Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and
the Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that
the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,
the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans specified
in such notice shall be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies
the Agent prior to the time of any Borrowing of Euro-Dollar Loans
for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it
elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead
be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

         SECTION 8.02. Illegality.  If, after the date hereof,
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof (any such agency being referred to as an
"Authority" and any such event being referred to as a "Change of
Law"), or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of
any Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank
(or its Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar
Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the
Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the
Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent
pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving
such notice and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank
shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and
fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and
shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately
prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each
Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, together with accrued interest
thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan,
the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal
amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be
payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of
the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

         SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  (a) If
after the date hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by any Bank
(or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) of any Authority:

         (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office) to
    any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Euro-Dollar
    Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans,
    or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank
    (or its Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on
    its Euro-Dollar Loans or any other amounts due under this
    Agreement in respect of its Euro-Dollar Loans or its
    obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans (except for changes in
    the tax or rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank
    or its Lending Office, as the case may be, or franchise taxes
    imposed by the jurisdiction or any political subdivision or
    taking authority in which such Bank's principal executive
    office or Lending Office is located); or

         (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
    reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including,
    without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board
    of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding
    with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement
    included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage)
    against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
    credit extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office); or

         (iii) shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending Office)
    or on the United States market for the London interbank
    market any other condition affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans,
    its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
such Bank (or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any
Euro-Dollar Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Office) under this
Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an amount
deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after
demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.  In
determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods generally utilized by such Bank
to determine such amounts on a non-discriminatory portfolio
basis.  Before giving any notice pursuant to this Section, such
Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such
designation will avoid the need for giving such notice, and will
not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.

         (b) If any Bank shall have determined that after the
date hereof the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or
any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any Authority, has or would have the effect
of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change
or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies
with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after
demand by such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for
such reduction.

         (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the
Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the
date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation
pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of
such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A
certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section
and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid
(together with an explanation, including calculations, of how
such amounts were determined) to it hereunder shall constitute
rebuttable presumptive evidence of the amount payable to any
relevant Bank.  In determining such amount, such Bank may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods generally utilized
by such Bank to determine such amounts on a non-discriminatory
portfolio basis.

         (d)  The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be
applicable with respect to any Participant, Assignee or other
Transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions
shall be made based upon the circumstances of such Participant,
Assignee or other Transferee.

         SECTION 8.04. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected
Euro-Dollar Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or
maintain Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section
8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section
8.03, and the Borrower shall, by at least 5 Euro-Dollar Business
Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected
that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank,
then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for
compensation no longer apply:


         (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by such
    Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans, and shall be made instead as Base
    Rate Loans, and

         (b)  after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been
    repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be
    applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to
    repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

         SECTION 8.05. Compensation.  Upon the request of any
Bank, delivered to the Borrower and the Agent, the Borrower shall
pay to such Bank such amount or amounts as shall compensate such
Bank for any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a
result of:

         (a)  any payment or prepayment (pursuant to Section 8.02
or otherwise) of a Euro-Dollar Loan on a date other than the last
day of an Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan; or

         (b)  any failure by the Borrower to prepay a Euro-Dollar
Loan on the date for such prepayment specified in the relevant
notice of prepayment hereunder; or

         (c)  any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Euro-Dollar
Loan on the date for the Euro-Dollar Borrowing of which such
Euro-Dollar Loan is a part specified in the applicable Notice of
Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 2.02;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would
have accrued on the amount so paid or prepaid or not prepaid or
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment
or failure to prepay or borrow to the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan (or, in the
case of a failure to prepay or borrow, the Interest Period for
such Euro-Dollar Loan which would have commenced on the date of
such failure to prepay or borrow) at the applicable rate of
interest for such Euro-Dollar Loan provided for herein over (y)
the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank)
such Bank would have paid on deposits in Dollars of equal or
comparable amounts having terms comparable to such period placed
with it by leading banks in the London interbank market.


                           ARTICLE IX

                          MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 9.01. Notices.  All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing
(including bank wire, telex, telecopier or similar writing) and
shall be given to such party at its address or telecopier or
telex number set forth on the signature pages hereof or such
other address or telecopier or telex number as such party may
hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to each other party.
Each such notice, request or other communication shall be
effective (i) if given by telecopier or telex, when such
telecopier or telex is transmitted to the telecopier or telex
number specified in this Section and the appropriate confirmation
or answerback is received, (ii) if given by certified mail
return-receipt requested, on the date set forth on the receipt
(provided, that any refusal to accept any such notice shall be
deemed to be notice thereof as of the time of any such refusal),
addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when
delivered at the address specified in this Section; provided that
notices to the Agent under Article II or Article VIII shall not
be effective until received.

         SECTION 9.02. No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the
Agent, any Bank or the Borrower in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

         SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Documentary Taxes.  The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent
and the Banks, including reasonable fees and disbursements of
Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and the internal counsel of First
Chicago, in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, any waiver or consent hereunder or
thereunder or any amendment and (ii) if a Default occurs, all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent and any
Bank, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel,
including, without limitation, the internal counsel of First
Chicago, in connection with such Default and collection and other
enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom, including reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in enforcing this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent
and each Bank against any transfer taxes, documentary taxes,
assessments or charges made by any Authority by reason of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents.

         SECTION 9.04. Indemnification.  (a) The Borrower shall
indemnify the Agent, the Banks and each affiliate thereof and
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (each
an "Indemnified Party") from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to
which any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses,
liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from any
actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of any
extension of credit by any Bank hereunder or breach by the
Borrower of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or from any
investigation, litigation or other proceeding (including any
threatened investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing
(an "Indemnity Proceeding"), and the Borrower shall reimburse
each Indemnified Party, upon demand for any reasonable expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) incurred
in connection with any such investigation or proceeding ("Claims
and Expenses"); but excluding any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Indemnified Party;
provided, that should the Borrower pay any amounts to the Agent
or the Banks due to this Section, and it shall be determined that
the harm being indemnified against resulted from the Agent's or
any Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, then such party
receiving such payment shall rebate such payment to the Borrower,
together with interest thereon accruing at the Federal Funds Rate
from the date such payment was made until the date such rebate is
received by the Borrower (calculated for the actual number of
days elapsed on the basis of a 365 day year).

         (b)  If the Borrower is required to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant hereto and has provided evidence
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party that the
Borrower has the financial wherewithal to reimburse such
Indemnified Party for any amount paid by such Indemnified Party
with respect to such Indemnity Proceeding, unless such
Indemnified Party shall have an important general interest
(i.e. an interest having general application to its business
other than solely with respect to the Loans under this Agreement)
in settling or compromising such Indemnity Proceeding, such
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such
Indemnity Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

         (c)  If a claim is to be made by an Indemnified Party
under this Section, the Indemnified Party shall give written
notice to the Borrower promptly after the Indemnified Party
receives actual notice of any Claims and Expenses incurred or
instituted for which the indemnification is sought; provided,
that, the failure to give such prompt notice shall not decrease
the Claims and Expenses payable by the Borrower.  If requested by
the Borrower in writing, and so long as (i) no Default or Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the
Borrower has acknowledged in writing to the Indemnified Party
that the Borrower shall be obligated under the terms of its
indemnity hereunder in connection with such Indemnity Proceeding,
the Borrower may, at its election, conduct the defense of any
such Indemnified Proceeding to the extent such contest may be
conducted in good faith on legally supported grounds, unless such
Indemnified Party shall have an important general interest
(i.e. an interest having general application to its business
other than solely with respect to the Loans under this Agreement)
in settling or compromising such Indemnity Proceeding (in which
case such Indemnified Party shall conduct the defense of same).
If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against any
Indemnified Party entitled to the benefit of indemnity under this
Section, written notice thereof shall be given to the Borrower as
soon as practicable (and in any event within 15 days after the
service of the citation or summons). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure so to notify the Borrower as provided in
this Section will not relieve the Borrower from liability
hereunder. After such notice, the Borrower shall be entitled, if
it so elects, to take control of the defense and investigation of
such lawsuit or action and to employ and engage counsel of its
own choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to
handle and defend the same, at the Borrower's cost, risk and
expense; provided however, that the Borrower and its counsel
shall proceed with diligence and in good faith with respect
thereto; and, provided, further, that, should an important
general interest (i.e. an interest having general application to
its business other than solely with respect to the Loans under
this Agreement) of the Indemnified Party be at issue, then, the
Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of any Indemnity
Proceeding. If (i) the engagement of such counsel by the Borrower
would present a conflict of interest which would prevent such
counsel from effectively defending such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, (ii) the defendants in, or targets of, any
such lawsuit or action include both the Indemnified Party and
Borrower, and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that
there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the Borrower, (iii) the
Borrower fails to assume the defense of the lawsuit or action or
to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party, in either case in a timely manner, or (iv) a Default or
Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, then such
Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel to represent or
defend it in any such action or proceeding and the Borrower will
pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel; provided, however
that each Indemnified Party shall endeavor, but shall not be
obligated, in connection with any matter covered by this Section
which also involves other Indemnified Parties, to use reasonable
efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts by counsel
for all indemnities. Should the Borrower be entitled to conduct
the defense of any Indemnity Proceeding pursuant to the terms of
this Section, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate (with all
Claims and Expenses associated therewith to be paid by the
Borrower) in all reasonable respects with the Borrower and such
attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit
or action and any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however
that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost (except as set
forth in, and in accordance with, the foregoing sentence),
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such
lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom.

         SECTION 9.05  Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Bank agrees that
if it shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or
otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of principal and interest owing with respect to the Note
held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any
other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of all principal
and interest owing with respect to the Note held by such other
Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment
shall purchase such participations in the Notes held by the other
Banks owing to such other Banks, and such other adjustments shall
be made, as may be required so that all such payments of
principal and interest with respect to the Notes held by the
Banks owing to such other Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro
rata; provided that (i) nothing in this Section shall impair the
right of any Bank to exercise any right of setoff or counterclaim
it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to
the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other that its
indebtedness under the Notes, and (ii) if all or any portion of
such payment received by the purchasing Bank is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each
other Bank shall be rescinded and such other Bank shall repay to
the purchasing Bank the purchase price of such participation to
the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such
other Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x)
the amount of such other Bank's required repayment to (y) the
total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank
in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower
agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Note,
whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements,
may exercise rights of setoff or counterclaim and other rights
with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of
a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the
amount of such participation.

         SECTION 9.06. Amendments and Waivers.  (a) Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents may be amended
or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the
rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the
Agent); provided that, except as provided in the next succeeding
proviso, no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all
Banks, (i) change the Commitment of any Bank or subject any Bank
to any additional obligation, (ii) change the principal of or
rate of interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) change
the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any
Loan or any fees hereunder, (iv) change the amount of principal,
interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof,
(v) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks,
which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any
action under this Section or any other provision of this
Agreement, (vi) change the manner of application of any payments
made under this Agreement or the Notes, or (vii) release any
Guarantee given to support payment of the Loans.

         (b)  The Borrower will not solicit, request or negotiate
for or with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of
the provisions of this Agreement unless each Bank shall be
informed thereof by the Borrower and shall be afforded an
opportunity of considering the same and shall be supplied by the
Borrower with both (i) reasonably sufficient information to
enable it to make an informed decision with respect thereto, and
(ii) substantially the same information as supplied by the
Borrower to any other Bank.  Executed or true and correct copies
of any waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement shall be delivered by the Borrower to each Bank
forthwith following the date on which the same shall have been
executed and delivered by the requisite percentage of Banks.  The
Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be
paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or
additional interest, fee or otherwise, to any Bank (in its
capacity as such) as consideration for or as an inducement to the
entering into by such Bank of any waiver or amendment of any of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement unless such
remuneration is concurrently paid, on the same terms, ratably to
all such Banks.

         SECTION 9.07. No Margin Stock Collateral.  Each of the
Banks represents to the Agent, each of the other Banks and the
Borrower that it in good faith is not, directly or indirectly (by
negative pledge or otherwise), relying upon any Margin Stock as
collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided
for in this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.08. Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns; provided that the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Agent and the Banks.

         (b)  Subject to Section 9.08(f) below, any Bank may at
any time sell to one or more Persons (each a "Participant")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note
held by such Bank, any Commitment hereunder or any other interest
of such Bank hereunder.  In the event of any such sale by a Bank
of a participating interest to a Participant, such Bank's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such
Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof,
such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes under this Agreement, and the Borrower and the Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.  In no event shall a Bank that sells a participation
be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking
any action hereunder except that such Bank may agree that it will
not (except as provided below), without the consent of the
Participant, agree to (i) the change of any date fixed for the
payment of principal of or interest on the related loan or loans,
(ii) the change of the amount of any principal, interest or fees
due on any date fixed for the payment thereof with respect to the
related loan or loans, (iii) the change of the principal of the
related loan or loans, (iv) any change in the rate at which
either interest is payable thereon or (if the Participant is
entitled to any part thereof) commitment fee is payable hereunder
from the rate at which the Participant is entitled to receive
interest or commitment fee (as the case may be) in respect of
such participation, or (v) the release of any Guarantee given to
support payment of the Loans.  Each Bank selling a participating
interest in any Loan, Note, Commitment or other interest under
this Agreement shall, within 10 Domestic Business Days of such
sale, provide the Borrower and the Agent with written
notification stating that such sale has occurred and identifying
the Participant and the interest purchased by such Participant.
The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participation in
Loans outstanding from time to time.

         (c) Subject to Section 9.08(f) below, any Bank may at
any time assign to one or more banks or financial institutions
(each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part of all, of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and
such Assignee shall assume all such rights and obligations,
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D, executed by such Assignee, such transferor
Bank and the Agent (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not
then a Bank, by the Borrower); provided that (i) no interest may
be sold by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph (c) unless the
Assignee shall agree to assume ratably equivalent portions of the
transferor Bank's Commitment, (ii) the amount of the Commitment
of the assigning Bank subject to such assignment (determined as
of the effective date of the assignment) shall be equal to
$5,000,000 (or any larger multiple of $1,000,000), and (iii) no
interest may be sold  by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph (c) to
any Assignee that is not then a Bank, or an Affiliate of a Bank,
without the prior written consent of the Borrower for so long as
no Event of Default shall be in existence, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.  Upon (A) execution of the
Assignment and Acceptance by such transferor Bank, such Assignee,
the Agent and (if applicable) the Borrower, (B) delivery of an
executed copy of the Assignment and Acceptance to the Borrower
and the Agent, (C) payment by such Assignee to such transferor
Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such
transferor Bank and such Assignee, and (D) payment of a
processing and recordation fee of $2,500 to the Agent, such
Assignee shall for all purposes be a Bank party to this Agreement
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank under
this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an original party
hereto with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of
assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further
consent or action by the Borrower, the Banks or the Agent shall
be required.  Upon the consummation of any transfer to an
Assignee pursuant to this paragraph (c), the transferor Bank, the
Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so
that, if required, a new Note is issued to such Assignee and, if
necessary, a new Note shall be issued to the transferor Bank.

         (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.09, the
Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant,
Assignee or other transferee (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such
Bank's possession concerning the Borrower which has been
delivered to such Bank by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
or which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower in
connection with such Bank's credit evaluation prior to entering
into this Agreement.

         (e) No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 8.03 than the transferor Bank would
have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights
transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section
8.02 or 8.03 requiring such Bank to designate a different Lending
Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the
circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

         (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
hereinabove, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, (i) Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A. and The First
National Bank of Chicago shall not sell participations in or
assign more than 49% of each such Bank's Commitment as in effect
as of the Closing Date (other than to Affiliates of each such
Bank), (ii) no  other Bank may participate or assign more than
51% of its Commitment (other than to one of its Affiliates) as in
effect on the date that it becomes a Bank without the prior
written consent of the Agent, the Borrower (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and the Required Banks and (iii) no
Bank may assign or sell a participation in any of its rights or
obligations hereunder unless such Bank sells an equal percentage
interest in its rights and obligations under the Acquisition
Credit Agreement.  If an Event of Default shall be in existence,
then the Banks may sell any number of participations and
assignments in the Loans if such transfers are otherwise in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.09. Confidentiality.  Each Bank agrees to
exercise its best efforts and in any event not less than the same
degree of care as it uses to maintain its own confidential
information in maintaining the confidentiality of any information
delivered or made available by the Borrower to it which is
clearly indicated to be confidential information from any one
other than persons employed or retained by such Bank who are or
are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving,
structuring or administering the Loans; provided, however that
nothing herein shall prevent any Bank from disclosing such
information (i) to any other Bank, (ii) upon the order of any
court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the request or demand
of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over
such Bank, (iv) which has been publicly disclosed by means which
are not violative of this Section 9.09, (v) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which
the Agent, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be a
party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in connection with
the exercise of any right, power of remedy hereunder or under any
of the other Loan Documents, (vii) to such Bank's legal counsel
and independent auditors and (viii) to any actual or proposed
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee of all or part of its
rights hereunder which has agreed in writing (aa) to be bound by
the provisions of this Section 9.09 and (bb) that the Borrower is
a third party beneficiary of such agreement, and (cc) to return
all copies of the confidential information to the Agent if the
proposed assignment or participation is not consummated.

         SECTION 9.10. Representation by Banks.  Each Bank hereby
represents that it is a commercial lender or financial
institution which makes Loans in the ordinary course of its
business and that it will make its Loans hereunder for its own
account in the ordinary course of such business; provided,
however that, subject to Section 9.08, the disposition of the
Note or Notes held by that Bank shall at all times be within its
exclusive control.

         SECTION 9.11. Obligations Several.  The obligations of
each Bank hereunder are several, and no Bank shall be responsible
for the obligations or commitment of any other Bank hereunder.
Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by Banks
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Banks to be a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of
entity.  The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Bank
shall be a separate and independent debt, and each Bank shall be
entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and it shall not be
necessary for any other Bank to be joined as an additional party
in any proceeding for such purpose.

         SECTION 9.12. Georgia Law.  This Agreement and each Note
shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of
the State of Georgia.

         SECTION 9.13. Interpretation.  No provision of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be construed
against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party hereto by
any court or other governmental or judicial authority by reason
of such party having or being deemed to have structured or
dictated such provision.

         SECTION 9.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; CONSENT TO
JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER (A) AND EACH OF THE BANKS AND THE
AGENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, (B) SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE PERSONAL
JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, THE COURTS THEREOF AND THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS SITTING THEREIN, FOR THE
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS, AND (C) WAIVES ANY AND ALL PERSONAL RIGHTS UNDER THE
LAW OF ANY JURISDICTION TO OBJECT ON ANY BASIS (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCONVENIENCE OF FORUM) TO JURISDICTION OR
VENUE WITHIN THE STATE OF GEORGIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF LITIGATION
TO ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED, HOWEVER, SHALL PREVENT THE AGENT FROM
BRINGING ANY ACTION OR EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS AGAINST THE BORROWER
PERSONALLY, AND AGAINST ANY ASSETS OF THE BORROWER, WITHIN ANY
OTHER STATE OR JURISDICTION.

         SECTION 9.15. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed, under seal, by their respective
authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

detail as the Agent or any Bank shall reasonably request, the
Borrower's pro forma compliance with the covenants contained in the
Compliance Certificate immediately preceding and immediately following
the consummation of the proposed acquisition.

                (b)     Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing the
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of
such Bank's ratable share of such Borrowing and such Notice of
Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

                (c) Not later than 1:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time)
on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in
paragraph (d) of this Section) make available its ratable share of
such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds im mediately available in
Atlanta, Georgia, to the Agent at its address referred to in Section
9.01.  Unless the Agent determines that any applicable condition
specified in Article III has not been satisfied, the Agent will make
the funds so received fr om the Banks available to the Borrower by
4:00 P.M.  (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date of a Borrowing at the
Agent's aforesaid address.  Unless the Agent receives notice from a
Bank, at the Agent's address referred to in or specified pursuant to
Sec tion 9.01, no later than 12:00 P.M.  (local time at such address)
on the date of a Borrowing stating that such Bank will not make a Loan
in connection with such Borrowing, the Agent shall be entitled to
assume that such Bank will make a Loan in connection with such
Borrowing and, in reliance on such assumption, the Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) make available such Bank's ratable share of
such Borrowing to the Borrower for the account of such Bank.  If the
Agent makes such Bank's ratable share available to the Borrower and
such Bank does not in fact make its ratable share of such Borrowing
available on such date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such
Bank's ratable share from such Bank or the Borrower (and for such
purpose shall be entitled to charge such amount to any account of the
Borrower maintained with the Agent), together with interest thereon
for each day during the period from the date of such Borrowing until
such sum shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate for each such day during such period, provided that
any such payment by the Borrower of such Bank's ratable share and
interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any rights that the
Borrower may have against such Bank.  If the Agent does not exercise
its option to advance funds for the account of such Bank, it shall
forthwith notify the Borrower of such decision.

                (d) If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on
which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Loan
from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to
make such repayment and only an amount equal to the difference (if
any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid
shall be made available by such Bank to the Agent as provided in
paragraph (c) of this Section, or remitted by the Borrower to the
Agent as provided in Section 2.11, as the case may be.

                (e)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no Euro-Dollar Borrowing may be made if
there shall have occurred a Default or an Event of Default, which
Default or Event of Default shall not have been cu red or waived.

                (f) In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to
specify whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base
Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, such Loans shall be made as Base Rate
Loans.  If the Borrower is otherwise entitl ed under this Agreement to
repay any Loans maturing at the end of an Interest Period applicable
thereto with the proceeds of a new Borrowing, and the Borrower fails
to repay such Loans using its own moneys and fails to give a Notice of
Borrowing in c onnection with such new Borrowing, a new Borrowing
shall be deemed to be made on the date such Loans mature (in
accordance with Section 2.04) in an amount equal to the principal
amount of the Loans so maturing, and the Loans comprising such new
Borrowing shall be Base Rate Loans.

                (g)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                         contained herein, there shall not be more
                         than 8 interest rates (including the
                         Applicable Margins) applicable to the Loans
                         at any given time.

                SECTION 2.03. Notes.  (a) The Loans of each Bank shall
be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of such Bank for
the account of its Lending Office in an amount equal to the original
principal amount of such Bank's Commitment.

                (b) Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to
Section 3.01, the Agent shall mail such Note to such Bank.  Each Bank
shall record, and prior to any transfer of each of its Notes shall
endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof a ppropriate notations
to evidence, the date, amount and maturity of each Loan made by it,
the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the Borrower
with respect thereto and whether such Loan is a Base Rate Loan or
Euro-Dollar Loan, and suc h schedule shall constitute rebuttable
presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on such
Bank's Notes; provided that the failure of any Bank to make any such
recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrow er hereunder or under the Notes.  Each Bank is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Notes and to
attach to and make a part of any Note a continuation of any such
schedule as and when required.

                SECTION 2.04. Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan included
in any Borrowing shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall
be due and payable, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
to such Borrowing.  The entire principal balance of the Loans,
together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, shall be due
and payable on the Termination Date.

                SECTION 2.05. Interest Rates.  (a) "Applicable Margin"
means (i) for any Base Rate Loan, 0.0%, and (ii) for any Euro-Dollar
Loan, 1.50%.

                (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such
Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable Margin.  Such interest
shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof.
Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, overdue interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the Default Rate.

                (c) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted London I nterbank
Offered Rate for such Interest Period; provided that if any Euro-
Dollar Loan shall, as a result of paragraph (1)(c) of the definition
of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less than 1 month, such
Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest during such Interest Period at
the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period.  Any
overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the
Default Rate.

                The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate"
applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the
quotient obtained (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next higher
1/16th of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London Interbank Offered
Rate for such Interest Period by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage.

                The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Euro-Dollar Loan means for the Interest Period of such Euro-Dollar
Loan, the rate per annum determined on the basis of the offered rate
for deposits in Dollars of amounts equal or comparable to the
principal amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan offered for a term
comparable to such Interest Period, which rates appear on the Reuters
Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, 2 Euro-Dollar Business
Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period, provided that (i)
if more than one such offered rate appears on the Reuters Screen LIBO
Page, the "London Interbank Offered Rate" will be the arithmetic
average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16th of
1%) of such offered rates; (ii) if no such offered rates appear on
such page, the "London Interbank Offered Rate" for such Interest
Period will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if necessary,
to the  next higher 1/16th of 1%) of rates quoted by not less than two
major banks in New York City, selected by the Agent, at approximately
10:00 A.M., New York City time, 2 Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to
the first day of such Interest Period, for deposits in Dollars offered
to leading European banks for a term comparable to such Interest
Period in an amount equal or comparable to the principal amount of
such Euro-Dollar Loan.

                "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day
that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such
day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve
requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in respect
of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest
rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions
of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States
office of any Bank to United States residents).

                (d) The Agent shall determine each interest rate
applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt notice
to the Borrower and the Banks by telecopier, telex or cable of each
rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                SECTION 2.06. Fees.  (a) The Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee calculated at the
rate of (i) 0.375% per annum on the total amount of the Commitments
that do not constitute Activated Commitments, and (ii) 0.50% per annum
on the total amount of the Activated Commitments.  Such facility fees
shall accrue from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
Termination Date and shall be payable, in arrears, on each March 31,
June 30, September 30, and December 31, and on the Termination Date.

                (b)     The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the

fully earned and non-refundable arrangement fee in the amount of
$5,000, and (ii) contemporaneously with the delivery of each
Deactivation Notice (other than the first Deactivation Notice so
delivered), a deactivation fee in the amount of $1,000.

                SECTION 2.07. Optional Termination or Reduction of the
Commitments.  The Borrower may, upon at least 3 Domestic Business
Days' notice to the Agent, terminate at any time, or proportionately
reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of at least
$1,000,000, the Commitments.  If the Commitments are terminated in
their entirety, all accrued fees (as provided under Section 2.06)
shall be due and payable on the effective date of such termination and
shall not thereafter accrue.

                SECTION 2.08. Mandatory Reduction and Termination of
Commitments.  The Commitments shall be reduced permanently to the
extent of any payments which are required by Section 2.10(b),
irrespective of whether any Loans are actually outstanding; provided,
however, that the Commitments shall not be reduced by an amount
required to be paid due to Section 2.10(b)(ii) unless and then only to
the extent that there are Loans outstanding hereunder at the time of
any equity offering of securities referred to in Section 2.10(b)(ii).
The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans
then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) sha ll be
due and payable on such date.

                SECTION 2.09. Optional Prepayments.  (a) The Borrower
may, on any Domestic Business Day, by notice to the Agent prior to
10:30 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on such date, prepay any Base Rate
Borrowing in whole at any time, or from time to time in part in
amounts aggregating at least $500,000, by paying the principal amount
to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay
ratably the Base Rate Loans of the several Banks included in such Base
Rate Borrowing.

                (b)     Subject to Section 8.05, the Borrower may, on
any Euro-Dollar Business Day, by notice to the Agent prior to 10:30
A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on such date, prepay any Euro-Dollar Loan
in whole at any time, or from time to time in part, prior to the
maturity thereof, in amounts aggregating at least $1,000,000 (except
that any such prepayment may be in any lesser amount equal to the
entire outstanding balance of any relevant Euro-Dollar Loan), by
paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued
interest thereon to the date of the prepayment.

                (c)     Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment
pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of
the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such
prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the
Borrower.

                SECTION 2.10. Mandatory Prepayments.  (a) On each date
on which the Commitments are reduced pursuant to Section 2.07 or
Section 2.08, the Borrower shall repay or prepay such principal a
mount of the outstanding Loans, if any (together with interest accrued
thereon), as may be necessary so that after such payment the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Loans does not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Commitments as then reduced .

customary costs and expenses incurred directly in connection
therewith, (i) 100% of all amounts received by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary from a debt offering or private placement transaction, (ii)
50% of all amounts received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary from a
securities offering, or (iii) 100% of all amounts received by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary from borrowed monies not permitted by the
terms hereof, shall be immediately applied by the Borrower to the
outstanding Loans hereunder.

                SECTION 2.11. General Provisions as to Payments.

on, the Loans and of facility fees hereunder, not later than 10:30

distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment
received by the Agent for the account of the Banks.

                (b)     Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Base Rate Loans or of facility fees shall be due on a
day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.
Whenever any payment of principal of or interest on, the Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in
another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.

                SECTION 2.12. Computation of Interest and Fees.

        ARTICLE IV

        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                On the Activation Date, and at such other times as
specified in Section 3.02, the Borrower represents and warrants that:

                SECTION 4.01. Corporate Existence and Power.  The
Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, is
duly qualified to transact business in every jurisdiction set forth on
Schedule 4.01 and the failure of the Borrower to be so qualified in
any other jurisdiction could not reasonably be expected to have or
cause a Material Adverse Effect, and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required
to carry on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to
have any such licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals could n
ot reasonably be expected to have or cause a Material Adverse Effect.

                SECTION 4.02. Corporate and Governmental
 Authorization; No Contravention.  The execution, delivery and
 performance by the Borrower of this Agreement, the Notes and the
 other Loan Documents (i) are within the Borrower's corporate powers,

 (iii) require no action by or in respect of or filing with, any
 governmental body, agency or official, (iv) do not contravene, or
 constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or
 regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
 Borrower or of any material agreement, judgment, injunction, order,
 decree or other i nstrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its
 Subsidiaries, and (v) do not result in the creation or imposition of
 any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

                SECTION 4.03. Binding Effect.  This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower enforceable
in accordance with its terms, and the Notes and the other Loan
Documents to which the Borrower is a party, when executed and
delivered in accordance with this Agreement, will constitute valid and
binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, provided that the enforceability hereof and
thereof is subject in each case to general principles of equity and to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, and similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

                SECTION 4.04. Financial Information.  (a) The
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries as of May 31, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
Fiscal Year then ended, reported on by Arthur Andersen & Co., copies
of which have been delivered to each of the Banks, and the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Borrower for the interim
period ended February 28, 1994, copies of which have been delivered to
each of the Banks, fairly present in all material respects, in
conformity with GAAP (subject to normal, recurring, year-end audit
adjustments), the consolidated financial po sition of the Borrower and
its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for such periods stated.

                (b)     Since May 31, 1993, there has been no event,
                        act, condition or occurrence having a Material
                        Adverse Effect.

                SECTION 4.05. No Litigation.  There is no action, suit
or proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened,
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before
any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official
which could reasonably be expected to have or cause a Material Adverse
Effect.

                SECTION 4.06. Compliance with ERISA.  (a) The Borrower
and each member of the Controlled Group have fulfilled their
obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code
with respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all material
respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Code, and have not incurred any liability to the PBGC under Title IV
of ERISA.

                (b)     Neither the Borrower nor any member of the
                        Controlled Group is or ever has been obligated
                        to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan.

                SECTION 4.07. Taxes.  There have been filed on behalf
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries all Federal, state and local
income, excise, property and other tax returns which are required to
be filed by them and all taxes due pursuant to such returns or
pursuant to any assessment received by or on behalf of the Borrower or
any Subsidiary have been paid or contested as permitted by Section
5.15.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental charges
are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate.  United States income
tax returns of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries' have been examined
and closed through the Fiscal Year ended May 31, 1992.

                SECTION 4.08. Subsidiaries.  Each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, is
qualified to transact business in every jurisdiction set forth in
Schedule 4.08 and the failure of any such Subsidiary Guarantor to be
so qualified in any other jurisdictions could not reasonably be
expected to have or cause a Material Adverse Effect, and has all
corporate powers  and all governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except where the failure to have any such licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals could not reasonably be
expected to have or cause a Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower has
no Subsidiaries except for those Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.08,

        ARTICLE VII

        THE AGENT

                SECTION 7.01. Appointment; Powers and Immunities.
Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act
as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents with such
powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof
and thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto.  The Agent: (a) shall have no duties or
responsibilities except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document be a trustee for any Bank; (b) shall not be
responsible to the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by any Bank under, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or for the validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein or
therein or for any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to
initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder
or under any other Loan Document except to the extent requested by the
Required Banks, and then only on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Agent, and (d) shall not be responsible for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document
or any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein
or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own
gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Agent may employ agents
and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it
with reasonable care.  The provisions of this Article VII are solely
for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks, and the Borrower shall not
have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions
hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement
and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as
agent of the Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with
or for the Borrower.  The duties of the Agent shall be ministerial and
administrative in nature, and the Agent shall not have by reason of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in
respect of any Bank.

                SECTION 7.02. Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telefax, telegram or cable)
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or
sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants or other
experts selected by the Agent.  As to any matters not expressly
provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions
signed by the Required Banks , and such instructions of the Required
Banks in any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding on all of the Banks.

                SECTION 7.03. Defaults.  The Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default (other than the nonpayment of principal of or interest on the
Loans) unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or the
Borrower specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "Notice of Default".  In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks.  The
Agent shall give each Bank prompt notice of each nonpayment of
principal of or interest on the Loans whether or not it has received
any notice of the occurrence of such nonpayment.  The Agent shall
(subject to Section 9.06) take such action hereunder with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the Required
Banks, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received
such directio ns, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Banks.

                SECTION 7.04. Rights of Agent as a Bank.  With respect
to the Loans made by it, Wachovia in its capacity as a Bank hereunder
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and
may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Agent, and
the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include Wachovia in its individual capacity.  The Agent may
(without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or
other business with the Borrower (and any of its Affiliates) as if it
were not acting as the Agent, and the Agent may accept fees and other
consideration from the Borrower (in addition to any agency fees and
arrangement fees heretofore agreed to between the Borrower and the
Agent) for services in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or otherwise without having to account for the same to
the Banks.

                SECTION 7.05. Indemnification.  Each Bank severally
agrees to indemnify the Agent, to the extent the Agent shall not have
been reimbursed by the Borrower, ratably in accordance with its
Commitment, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including,
without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imp osed on, incurred
by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (excluding, unless an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the normal administrative costs and
expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder)
or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or any such
other documents; provided, however that no Bank shall be liable for
any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent.  If any indemnity
furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the
Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

                SECTION 7.06. Payee of Note Treated as Owner.  The
Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof
for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Agent
and the provisions of Section 9.08(c) have been satisfied.  Any
requests, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making
such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any
Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder,
transferee or assignee of that Note or of any Note or Notes issued in
exchange therefor or replacement thereof.

                SECTION 7.07. Nonreliance on Agent and Other Banks.
Each Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis
of the Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents.  The Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect
the properties or books of the Borrower or any other Person.  Except
for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly
required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or under
the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of
the Borrower or any other Person (or any of their Affiliates) which
may come into the possession of the Agent.

                SECTION 7.08. Failure to Act.  Except for action
expressly required of the Agent hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing
or refus ing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive
further assurances to its satisfaction by the Banks of their
indemnification obligations under Section 7.05 against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by the Agent by reason of
taking, continuing to take, or failing to take any such action.

                SECTION 7.09. Resignation or Removal of Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by giving not
notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower and the Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Banks.
Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall have
the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's notice of
resignation or the Required Banks' removal of the retiring Agent, then
the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor
Agent.  Any successor Agent shall be a bank which has a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall continue
in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder.


        ARTICLE VIII

        CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; COMPENSATION

                SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate
Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any Interest
Period:

                (a)     the Agent reasonably determines that deposits
                        in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not
                        being offered in the relevant market for such
                        Interest Period, or

                (b) the Required Banks advise the Agent that the
London Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be, as determined by
the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Banks of funding Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Agent
shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the
Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans specified in such notice shall be
suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent prior to the time
of any Borrowing of Euro-Dollar Loans for which a Notice of Borrowing
has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date,
such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

                SECTION 8.02. Illegality.  If, after the date hereof,
 the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
 therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
 thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
 agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (any
 such agency being referred to as an "Authority" and any such event
 being referred to as a "Change of Law"), or compliance by any Bank
 (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not
 having the force of law) of any Authority shall make it unlawful or
 impossible for any Bank (or its Lending Office) to make, maintain or
 fund its Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent,
 the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and
 the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the
 Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer
 exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be
 suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this
 Section, such Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such
 designation will avoid the need for giving such n otice and will not,
 in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous
 to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully
 continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar
 Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower
 shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal
 amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, together with accrued
 interest thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar
 Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal
 principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal
 shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans
 of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

                SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return.
(a) If after the date hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by any
Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) of any Authority:

                (i)     shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office)
 to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Euro-Dollar
 Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or
 shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank (or its
 Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its Euro-Dollar
 Loans or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of its
 Euro-Dollar Loans or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans (except
 for changes in the tax or rate of tax on the overall net income of
 such Bank or its Lending Office, as the case may be, or franchise
 taxes imposed by the jurisdiction or any political subdivision or
 taxing authority in which such Bank's principal executive office or
 Lending Office is located); or

                (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including, without
limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-
Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office);
or

                (iii) shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending Office)
                      or on the United States market for the London
                      interbank market any other condition affecting
                      its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Notes or its
                      obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Bank (or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar
Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Bank (or its Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its
Notes with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be
material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy
to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost
or reduction.  In determining such amount, such Bank may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods generally utilized by
such Bank to determine such amounts on a non-discriminatory portfolio
basis.  Before giving any notice pursuant to this Section, such Bank
shall designate a different Lending Office if such designation will
avoid the need for giving such notice, and will not, in the reasonable
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

                (b) If any Bank shall have determined that after the
date hereof the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation
regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any
Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Bank's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder
to a level below that which such Bank could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after
demand by such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such
reduction.

                (c)     Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower
and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after
the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant
to this Section and will designate a different Lending  Office if
such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of any
Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts (together with an explanation, including
calculations, of how such amounts were determined) to be paid to it
hereunder shall constitute rebuttable presumptive evidence of th e
amount payable to any relevant Bank.  In determining such amount, such
Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods
generally utilized by such Bank to determine such amounts on a non-
discriminatory portfolio basis.

                (d)     The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be
applicable with respect to any Participant, Assignee or other
Transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions shall be
made based upon the circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or
other Transferee.

                SECTION 8.04. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected
Euro-Dollar Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or
maintain Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section
8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03,
and the Borrower shall, by at least 5 Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior
notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the
provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and
until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

                (a)     all Loans which would otherwise be made by
                        such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans, and shall be
                        made instead as Base Rate Loans, and

                (b)     after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been
                        repaid, all payments of principal which would
                        otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar
                        Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate
                        Loans instead.

                SECTION 8.05. Compensation.  Upon the request of any
Bank, delivered to the Borrower and the Agent, the Borrower shall pay
to such Bank such amount or amounts as shall compensate such Bank for
any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of:

                (a)     any payment or prepayment (pursuant to Section
                        8.02 or otherwise) of a Euro-Dollar Loan on a
                        date other than the last day of an Interest
                        Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan; or

                (b)     any failure by the Borrower to prepay a Euro-
                        Dollar Loan on the date for such prepayment
                        specified in the relevant notice of prepayment
                        hereunder; or

                (c)     any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Euro-
                        Dollar Loan on the date for the Euro-Dollar
                        Borrowing of which such Euro-Dollar Loan is a
                        part specified in the applicable Notice of
                        Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 2.02;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so paid or prepaid or not prepaid or borrowed
for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment or failure to
prepay or borrow to the last day of the then current Interest Period
for such Euro-Dollar Loan (or, in the case of a failure to prepay or
borrow, the Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan which would have
commenced on the date of such failure to prepay or borrow) at the
applicable rate of interest for such Euro-Dollar Loan provided for
herein over (y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by
such Bank) such Bank would have paid on deposits in Dollars of equal
or comparable amounts having terms comparable to such period placed
with it by leading banks in the London interbank market.


        ARTICLE IX

        MISCELLANEOUS

                SECTION 9.01. Notices.  All notices, requests and
 other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing
 (including bank wire, telex, telecopier or similar writing) and shall
 be given to such party at its address or telecopier or telex number
 set forth on the signature pages hereof or such other address or
 telecopier or telex number as such party may hereafter specify for
 the purpose by notice to each other party.  Each such notice, request
 or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by
 telecopier or telex, when such telecopier or telex is transmitted to
 the telecopier or telex number specified in this Section and the
 appropriate confirmation or answerback is received, (i i) if given by
 certified mail return-receipt requested, on the date set forth on the
 receipt (provided, that any refusal to accept any such notice shall
 be deemed to be notice thereof as of the time of any such refusal),
 addressed as aforesaid or (ii i) if given by any other means, when
 delivered at the address specified in this Section; provided that
 notices to the Agent under Article II or Article VIII shall not be
 effective until received.

                SECTION 9.02. No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the
Agent, any Bank or the Borrower in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
law.

                SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Documentary Taxes.  The
 Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
 Agent and the Banks, including reasonable fees and disbursements of
 Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and the internal counsel of First Chicago,
 in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other
 Loan Documents, any waiver or consent hereunder or thereunder or any
 amendment and (ii) if a Default occurs, all reasonable out-of-pocket
 expenses incurred by the Agent and any Bank, including reasonable
 fees and disbursements of counsel, including, without limitation, the
 internal counsel of First Chicago, in connection with such Default
 and collection and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom,
 including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in enforcing
 this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower shall
 indemnify the Agent and each Bank against any transfer taxes,
 documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any Authority by
 reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
 Loan Documents.

                SECTION 9.04. Indemnification.  (a) The Borrower shall
indemnify the Agent, the Banks and each affiliate thereof and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents (each an
"Indemnified Party") from, and hold each of them harmless against, any
and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them
may become subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or
damages arise out of or result from any actual or proposed use by the
Borrower of the proceeds of any extension of credit by any Bank
hereunder or breach by the Borrower of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or from any investigation, litigation or other
proceeding (including any threatened in vestigation or proceeding)
relating to the foregoing (an "Indemnity Proceeding"), and the
Borrower shall reimburse each Indemnified Party, upon demand for any
reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal
fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation or proceeding
("Claims and Expenses"); but excluding any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross negligence
or wilful misconduct of the Indemnified Party; provided, that should
the Borrower pay any amounts to the Agent or the Banks due to this
Section, and it shall be determined that the harm being indemnified
against resulted from the Agent's or any Bank's gross negligence or
wilful misconduct, then such party receiving such payment shall rebate
such payment to the Borrower, together with interest thereon accruing
at the Federal Funds Rate from the date such payment was made until
the date such rebate is received by the Borrower (calculated for the
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 365 day year).

                (b)     If the Borrower is required to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant hereto and has provided evidence reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party that the Borrower has the
financial wherewithal to reimburse such Indemnified Party for any
amount paid by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnity
Proceeding, unless such Indemnified Party shall have an important
general interest (i.e. an interest having general application to its
business other than solely with respect to the Loans under this
Agreement) in settling or compromising such Indemnity Proceeding, such
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Indemnity
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Borrower (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

                (c)     If a claim is to be made by an Indemnified
Party under this Section, the Indemnified Party shall give written
notice to the Borrower promptly after the Indemnified Party receives
actual notice of any Claims and Expenses incurred or instituted for
which the indemnification is sought; provided, that, the failure to
give such prompt notice shall not decrease the Claims and Expenses
payable by the Borrower.  If requested by the Borrower in writing, and
so long as (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing and (ii) the Borrower has acknowledged in writing to the
Indemnified Party that the Borrower shall be obligated under the terms
of its indemnity hereunder in connection with such Indemnity
Proceeding, the Borrower may, at its election, conduct the defense of
any such Indemnified Proceeding to the extent such contest may be
conducted in good faith on legally supported grounds, unless such
Indemnified Party shall have an important general interest (i.e. an
interest having general application to its business other than solely
with respect to the Loans under this Agreement) in settling or
compromising such Indemnity Proceeding (in which case such Indemnified
Party shall conduct the defense of same).  If any lawsuit or
enforcement action is filed against any Indemnified Party entitled to
the benefit of indemnity under this Section, written notice thereof
shall be given to the Borrower as soon as practicable (and in any
event within 15 days after the service of the citation or summons).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure so to notify the Borrower
as provided in this Section will not relieve the Borrower from
liability hereunder. After such notice, the Borrower shall be
entitled, if it so elects, to take control of the defense and
investigation of such lawsuit or action and to employ and engage
counsel of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party to handle and defend the same, at the Borrower's cost, risk and
expense; provided however, that the Borrower and its counsel shall
proceed with diligence and in good faith with respect thereto; and,
provided, further, that, should an important general interest (i.e. an
interest having general application to its business other than solely
with respect to the Loans under this Agreement) of the Indemnified
Party be at issue, then, the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense
of any Indemnity Proceeding. If (i) the engagement of such counsel by
t he Borrower would present a conflict of interest which would prevent
such counsel from effectively defending such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, (ii) the defendants in, or targets of, any such
lawsuit or action include both the Indemnified Party and Borrower, and
the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Borrower, (iii) the Borrower fails to assume
the defense of the lawsuit or action or to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, in either case in a timely
manner, or (iv) a Default or Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, then such Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel to
represent or defend it in any such action or proceeding and the
Borrower will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel;
provided, however that each Indemnified Party shall endeavor, but
shall not be obligated, in connection with any matter cove red by this
Section which also involves other Indemnified Parties, to use
reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts by
counsel for all indemnities.  Should the Borrower be entitled to
conduct the defense of any Indemnity Proceeding pursuant to the terms
of this Section, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate (with all
Claims and Expenses associated therewith to be paid by the Borrower)
in all reasonable respects with the Borrower and such attorneys in the
investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any
appeal arising therefrom; provided, however that the Indemnified Party
may, at its own cost (except as set forth in, and in accordance with,
the foregoing sentence), participate in the investigation, trial and
defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom.

                (d)     The Agent and each Bank agree that in the
 event that any Indemnity Proceeding is asserted or threatened in
 writing or instituted against it or any other party entitled to
 indemnification hereunder, the Agent or such Bank shall promptly
 notify the Borrower thereof in writing and agree, to the extent
 appropriate, to consult with the Borrower with a view to minimizing
 the cost to the Borrower of its obligations under this Section;
 provided, that, the failure to so notify the Borrower will not
 relieve the Borrower from liability hereunder.

                SECTION 9.05. Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Bank agrees
 that if it shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim
 or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount
 of principal and interest owing with respect to the Note held by it
 which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in
 respect of the aggregate amount of all principal and interest owing
 with respect to the Note held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving
 such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
 participations in the Notes held by the other Banks owing to such
 other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be
 required so that all such payments of principal and interest with
 respect to the Notes held by the Banks owing to such other Banks
 shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that (i) nothing in
 this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right
 of setoff or counter claim it may have and to apply the amount
 subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the
 Borrower other that its indebtedness under the Notes, and (ii) if all
 or any portion of such payment received by the purchasing Bank is
 thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from
 each other Bank shall be rescinded and such other Bank shall repay to
 the purchasing Bank the purchase price of such participation to the
 extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such other
 Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount
 of such other Bank's required repayment to (y) the total amount so
 recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount
 paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount
 so recovered.  The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may
 effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a
 participation in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the
 foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of setoff or
 counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as
 fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of
 the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                SECTION 9.06. Amendments and Waivers.  (a) Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents may be amended or wai
ved if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or
duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent); provided
that, except as provided in the next succeeding proviso, no such
amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all Banks, (i) change the
Commitment of any Bank or subject any Bank to any additional
obligation, (ii) change the principal of or rate of interest on any
Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) change the date fixed for any
payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder,
(iv) change the amount of principal, interest or fees due on any date
fixed for the payment thereof, (v) change the percentage of the
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes,
or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any
of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision
of this Agreement, (vi) change the manner of application of any
payments made under this Agreement or the Notes, or (vii) release any
Guarantee given to support payment of the Loans.

                (b)     The Borrower will not solicit, request or
negotiate for or with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of
any of the provisions of this Agreement unless each Bank shall be
informed thereof by the Borrower and shall be afforded an opportunity
of considering the same and shall be supplied by the Borrower with
both (i) reasonably sufficient information to enable it to make an
informed decision with respect thereto, and (ii) substantially the
same information as supplied by the Borrower to any other Bank.
Executed or true and correct copies of any waiver or consent effected
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be delivered by the
Borrower to each Bank forthwith following the date on which the same
shall have been executed and delivered by the requisite percentage of
Banks.  The Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to
be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional
interest, fee or otherwise, to any Bank (in its capacity as such) as
consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by such
Bank of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, on the
same terms, ratably to all such Banks.

                SECTION 9.07. No Margin Stock Collateral.  Each of the
Banks represents to the Agent, each of the other Banks and the
Borrower that it in good faith is not, directly or indirectly ( by
negative pledge or otherwise), relying upon any Margin Stock as
collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for
in this Agreement.

                SECTION 9.08. Successors and Assigns.  (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and ass
igns; provided that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Agent and the Banks.

                (b)     Subject to Section 9.08(f) below, any Bank may
at any time sell to one or more Persons (each a "Participant")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held
by such Bank, any Commitment hereunder or any other interest of such
Bank hereunder.  In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a
participating interest to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the perfo rmance thereof, such Bank shall remain the
holder of any such Note for all purposes under this Agreement, and the
Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under
this Agreement.  In no event shall a Bank that sells a participation
be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder except that such Bank may agree that it will not
(except as provided below), without the consent of the Participant,
agree to (i) the change of any date fixed for the payment of principal
of or interest on the related loan or loans, (ii) the change of the
amount of any principal, interest or fees due on any date fixed for
the payment there of with respect to the related loan or loans, (iii)
the change of the principal of the related loan or loans, (iv) any
change in the rate at which either interest is payable thereon or (if
the Participant is entitled to any part thereof) commitment fee is
payable hereunder from the rate at which the Participant is entitled
to receive interest or commitment fee (as the case may be) in respect
of such participation, or (v) the release of any Guarantee given to
support payment of the Loans.  Each Bank selling a participating
interest in any Loan, Note, Commitment or other interest under this
Agreement shall, within 10 Domestic Business Days of such sale,
provide the Borrower and the Agent with written notification stating
that such sale has oc curred and identifying the Participant and the
interest purchased by such Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with
respect to its participation in Loans outstanding from time to ti me.

                (c) Subject to Section 9.08(f) below, any Bank may at
any time assign to one or more banks or financial institutions (each
an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part of all, of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and such Assignee
shall assume all such rights and obligations, pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D,
executed by such Assignee, such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in
the case of an Assignee that is not then a Bank, by the Borrower);
provided that (i) no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to this
paragraph (c) unless the Assignee shall agree to assume ratably
equivalent portions of the transferor Bank's Commitment, (ii) the
amount of the Commitment of the assigning Bank subject to such
assignment (determined as of the effective date of the assignment)
shall be equal to $5,000,000 (or any larger multiple of $1,000,000),
and (iii) no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph
(c) to any Assignee that is not then a Bank, or an Affiliate of a
Bank, without the prior written consent of the Borrower for so long as
no Event of Default shall be in existence, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  Upon (A ) execution of the Assignment and
Acceptance by such transferor Bank, such Assignee, the Agent and (if
applicable) the Borrower, (B) delivery of an executed copy of the
Assignment and Acceptance to the Borrower and the Agent, (C) payment
by such Assi gnee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the
purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee,
and (D) payment of a processing and recordation fee of $2,500 to the
Agent, such Assignee shall for all purposes be a Bank party to this
Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank
under this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an original
party hereto with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of
assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further
consent or action by the Borrower, the Banks or the Agent shall be
required.  Upon the consummation of any transfer to an Assignee
pursuant to this paragraph (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a
new Note is issued to such Assignee and, if necessary, a new Note
shall be issued to the transferor Bank.

                (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.09, the
Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant, Assignee
or other transferee (each a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession
concerning the Borrower which has been delivered to such Bank by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to
such Bank by the Borrower in connection with such Bank's credit
evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement.

                (e) No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 8.03 than the transferor Bank would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written
consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or 8.03
requiring such Bank to designate a different Lending Office under
certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise
to such greater payment did not exist.

                (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
hereinabove, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (i) Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A. and The First National
Bank of Chicago shall not sell participations in or assign more than
49% of each such Bank's Commitment as in effect as of the Closing Date
(other than to Affiliates of each such Bank), (ii) no other Bank may
participate or assign more than 51% of its Commitment (other than to
one of its Affiliates) as in effect on the date that it becomes a Bank
without the prior written consent of the Agent, the Borrower (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Required Banks and
(iii) no Bank may assign or sell a participation in any of its rights
or obligations hereunder unless such Bank sells an equal percentage
interest in its rights and obligations under the Working Capital
Credit Agreement.  If an Event of Default shall be in existence, then
the Banks may sell any number of participations and assignments in the
Loans if such transfers are otherwise in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement.

                SECTION 9.09. Confidentiality.  Each Bank agrees to
exercise its best efforts and in any event not less than the same
degree of care as it uses to maintain its own confidential information
in maintaining the confidentiality of any information delivered or
made available by the Borrower to it which is clearly indicated to be
confidential information from any one other than persons employed or
retained by such Bank who are or are expected to become engaged in
evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the Loans;
provided, however that nothing herein shall prevent any Bank from
disclosing such information (i) to any other Bank, (ii) upon the order
of any court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the request or
demand of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over
such Bank, (iv) which has been publicly disclosed by means which are
not violative of this Section 9.09, (v) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation to which the Agent, any
Bank or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any right,
power of remedy hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents,
(vii) to such Bank's legal counsel and independent auditors and (viii)
to any actual or proposed Participant, Assignee or other Transferee of
all or part of its rights hereunder which has agreed in writing (aa)
to be bound by the provision s of this Section 9.09 and (bb) that the
Borrower is a third party beneficiary of such agreement, and (cc) to
return all copies of the confidential information to the Agent if the
proposed assignment or participation is not consummated.

                SECTION 9.10. Representation by Banks.  Each Bank
 hereby represents that it is a commercial lender or financial
 institution which makes Loans in the ordinary course of its business
 and that it will make its Loans hereunder for its own account in the
 ordinary course of such business; provided, however that, subject to
 Section 9.08, the disposition of the Note or Notes held by that Bank
 shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

                SECTION 9.11. Obligations Several.  The obligations of

FIRST RENEWAL
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     THIS FIRST RENEWAL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"),
is made and entered into effective as of the 18th day of May,
1995, by and between ROBERT A. YELLOWLEES, an individual resident
of the State of Georgia (hereinafter referred to as "Employee"),
and NATIONAL DATA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(hereinafter referred to as the "Company").

W I T N E S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to employ Employee
in an executive capacity, and Employee desires to continue to be
employed by the Company, on the terms and conditions hereinafter
set forth; and

     WHEREAS, the Employee's original Employment Agreement
provides for extension on or before May 17, 1994;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual promises and agreements contained herein, the parties
hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

     Section 1.  Employment; Position as Director.

     1.1  Officer Positions.  Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Company hereby extends the employment of Employee and
Employee hereby accepts such extension of employment.  Employee
shall continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman of the Board of the Company and shall perform such
duties as are assigned to him from time to time by the Board of
Directors.  The Board of Directors shall have the right
subsequently to elect as President of the Company an individual
other than Employee, but at all times during the term of this
Agreement Employee shall serve as Chief Executive Officer and at
all times during the term of this Agreement shall serve as
Chairman of the Board.  Employee shall devote his full business
time and best efforts to rendering services on behalf of the
Company.  It is understood that Employee will continue to serve
as a member of the Board of Directors and Chairman of Spectrum
Research Group, Inc. on an ongoing basis.

     1.2  Position as Director.  During the term of this
Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause
Employee to continue to be nominated and elected as a member of
the Board of Directors of the Company.  Employee shall not be
entitled to additional compensation for his service as a
Director.  The Company agrees that Employee's service as a
Director while he remains an employee of the Company shall be
credited for purposes of determination of eligibility for
benefits under and computation of the amount of benefits payable
pursuant to the Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors of the
Company.

     Section 2. Term.

     The employment of Employee hereunder shall continue pursuant
to the term of this Agreement effective as of May 18, 1995, and,
unless sooner terminated pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
with the consequences of termination set forth in such Section 5
and unless extended as provided below, shall continue through May
17, 1998.  The employment of Employee hereunder may be further
extended thereafter for terms of three years each upon the mutual
agreement of Employee and the Company to so extend on or before
the date one year prior to the expiration of any such term.

     Section 3.  Compensation; Bonuses; Expenses.

     3.1  Salary.  Employee shall be paid a salary during the
term of his employment hereunder at the initial rate of $470,000
per annum, subject to review by the Board on or about May 18,
1995, the inception date of this Agreement.  Such salary shall be
subject to annual review and possible increase by the Board of
Directors but shall not be decreased during the term of this
Agreement.

     3.2  Option Grants.

          (a)  The Company, in accordance with and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Company's 1987 Stock Option Plan,
hereby covenants and agrees to grant to Employee, effective as of
May 18, 1995, a non-qualified stock option consisting of three
components (collectively the "Options") to purchase an aggregate
of 300,000 shares of Common Stock.  Each Option Agreement shall
have a term of ten years and shall include the following
additional provisions:

                    (A)  One-third of the shares will have an
exercise price equal to the closing price of Company common stock
on the date the grant is formally approved by the Board,
contemplated to be May/June of 1995, but not less than $15.00 per
share.  The options awarded under this grant shall vest as
follows; 20% on May 17, 1997, and additional 25% on May 17, 1998,
an additional 25% on May 17, 1999, and an additional 30% on May
17, 2000.


               (B)  One-third of the shares will have an exercise
               price equal to 112% of the exercise price for the
shares described in (A) above.  The options awarded under this
paragraph shall vest as follows; 20% on May 17, 1998, and
additional 25% on May 17, 1999, an additional 25% on May 17,
2000, and an additional 30% on May 17, 2001.

               (C)  One-third of the shares will have an exercise
               price equal to 124% of the exercise price for the
shares described in (A) above.  The options awarded under this
grant shall vest as follows; 20% on May 17, 1999, an additional
25% on May 17, 2000, an additional 25% on May 17,2001, and an
additional 30% on May 17, 2002.

The Company and Employee shall enter into Option Agreements to
set forth the terms of each option grant, which Option Agreements
shall provide for the immediate and full vesting of the Options
in the event of (i) a Change in Control of the Company (as
defined in Section 5.2 hereof), (ii) the death or physical or
mental incapacity (as defined in Section 5.1 hereof) of Employee,
(iii) the termination of employment of Employee to the extent and
as provided in Section 5 hereof or (iv) this Agreement is not
renewed for an additional three year term as set forth in Section
2 above.

          (b)  Employee also shall be eligible for additional
stock option grants by the Company.  Any such additional grants
shall be in recognition of exceptional performance by Employee as
determined by the Company.

     3.3  Additional Bonuses.  The Company, upon recommendation
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and
approval by the Board of Directors, shall establish additional
bonus arrangements for Employee with respect to the Company's
fiscal years beginning on June 1, 1995 and thereafter during the
term of this Agreement.  The target amount for each such bonus
shall be equal to Employee's base salary for the fiscal year for
which the bonus is to be paid.  Such bonuses shall be based upon
specific performance objectives agreed upon by the Employee and
the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors.
The bonuses under this Section 3.3 may range from none to 150% of
the target amounts established as provided above.  The bonuses
under this Section 3.3 shall, at Employee's request, be paid in
whole or in part in shares of Common Stock.  The Company agrees
that in the event all or any portion of any such bonus shall be
paid in shares of Common Stock, the Company shall take any
reasonable actions necessary to enable Employee to dispose of
such shares without limitation under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended.  In the event of (i) a Change in Control of the

Company (as defined in Section 5.2 hereof), (ii) the death or
physical or mental incapacity (as defined in Section 5.1 hereof)
of Employee or (iii) the termination of employment of Employee to
the extent and as provided in Section 5 hereof, the Company shall
immediately pay to Employee or his successor in interest 75% of
the target amount of the bonus under this Section 3.3 for the
fiscal year in which such event occurs.

     3.4  Expenses.  The Company shall reimburse Employee for all
reasonable expenses incurred by Employee in connection with
performance of Employee's duties hereunder and vouched to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company pursuant to its standard
procedures.

     Section 4.  Additional Employment Benefits.

     Employee shall have the right to participate in such
medical, dental, disability, hospitalization, life insurance and
other benefit plans (such as pension and profit sharing plans)
and perquisites as the Company shall maintain from time to time
for the benefit of executive employees of the Company, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such plans.  In
addition, the Company shall maintain on behalf of Employee, or
reimburse Employee for the premiums paid for, whole life
insurance policies in the face amount of $2 million, currently
maintained as term insurance by and on the life of Employee.
Such policies shall be payable to a beneficiary or beneficiaries
designated by Employee, and the cash values and other benefits
associated with such policies shall be paid to or otherwise
enjoyed by such beneficiary or beneficiaries, or otherwise
Employee.  The Company also shall pay for disability income
insurance for Employee as requested by Employee in addition to
the amounts paid pursuant to the Company's existing disability
insurance plan; provided, however, that total payments by the
Company for life insurance and disability income insurance under
this Section 4 shall not exceed $55,000 per annum.

     Section 5.  Termination; Effect of Termination.

     5.1  Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement and the employment of
Employee pursuant hereto shall terminate upon the first to occur
of the following events:

          (i)       The death of Employee;

          (ii)      The lapse of thirty (30) days following the
date on which the Company shall give written notice to Employee
of termination of his employment hereunder by reason of his
physical or mental incapacity.  Employee shall be deemed to be
physically or mentally incapacitated for purposes of this
Agreement if by reason of any physical or mental incapacity he
has been unable, or it is reasonably expected that he will be
unable, for a period of at least one hundred eighty (180)
substantially continuous days to perform his regular duties and
responsibilities hereunder in a reasonably satisfactory manner.
In the event of any disagreement between Employee and the Company
as to whether Employee is physically or mentally incapacitated
such as to permit the Company to terminate his employment
pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the question of such incapacity
shall be submitted to an impartial and reputable physician for
determination, selected by mutual agreement of Employee and the
Company or, failing such agreement, selected by two physicians
(one of which shall be selected by the Company and the other by
Employee), and such determination of the question of such
incapacity by such physician shall be final and binding on
Employee and the Company.  The Company shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such physician; or

          (iii)     The lapse of fifteen (15) days following
written notice by the Company to Employee of termination for
"cause," which notice shall reasonably describe the cause for
which Employee's employment is being terminated.  For purposes of
this Agreement, "cause" shall mean:

                    (A)  Continued neglect of duties for which
               Employee is employed after receipt of initial
notice thereof from the Board of Directors and failure to remedy
such neglect of duties after agreement by the Company and
Employee to a reasonable plan and schedule for remediation
of such neglect of duties;

                    (B)  Misconduct involving moral turpitude in
               the performance of duties for which Employee is
employed, including, without limitation, the commission of fraud,
misappropriation or embezzlement by Employee; or

                    (C)  Employee's conviction for, or plea of
               guilty in connection with, the commission of any
felony in the performance of Employee's duties.

     5.2  Effect.

          (a)  Upon termination of this Agreement and Employee's
employment for any reason, Employee shall be entitled to receive
the compensation pursuant to Section 3 hereof owed to Employee
but unpaid for performance rendered under this Agreement as of
the date of termination ("Employee's Termination Date") and any
additional compensation he may be entitled to receive under the
terms of any employee benefit plan of the Company.

          (b)  In addition to the compensation under paragraph
(a) above, upon termination of this Agreement and Employee's
employment prior to the expiration of the initial term of this
Agreement as provided by Section 2 hereof, or prior to the
expiration of any renewal term as provided by such Section if
this Agreement is renewed, (i) upon the physical or mental
incapacity of Employee, (ii) by the Company other than pursuant
to Section 5.1(iii)(B) or 5.1(iii)(C) above or (iii) by Employee
following an Employee Status Change (as defined below) within
three years after a Change in Control of the Company (as defined
below):

               (A)  The Company shall pay Employee the Severance
               Benefit (as defined and in the manner described
               below);

               (B)  All Restricted Stock awarded to Employee at
               any time during his employment with the Company
shall be immediately and fully vested as of Employee's Termination
Date;

               (C)  All stock options awarded to Employee under
any employee stock option plan at any time during his employment
with the Company shall be fully vested as of Employee's
Termination Date; and

               (D)  The Company shall pay Employee 75% of the
target amount of the bonus provided under Section 3.3 hereof for
the fiscal year in which the employment of Employee terminates.

Also upon termination of this Agreement (i) by the Company other
than pursuant to Section 5.1(iii)(B) or 5.1(iii)(C) above or (ii)
by Employee following an Employee Status Change within three
years after a Change in Control of the Company, the Company shall
maintain in full force and effect, for Employee's benefit until
the earlier of (1) three years after Employee's Termination Date
or (2) commencement of Employee's full-time employment with a new
employer, all Benefit Plans (as defined below) in which Employee
was entitled to participate immediately prior to Employee's
Termination Date, provided that Employee's continued
participation is possible under the general terms and provisions
of such Benefit Plans.

          (c)  In addition to the compensation under paragraph
(a) above, upon termination of this Agreement and the employment
of Employee upon the death of Employee:


               (A)  All Restricted Stock awarded to Employee at
               any time during his employment with the Company
shall be immediately and fully vested as of Employee's Termination
Date; and

               (B)  All stock options awarded to Employee under
any employee stock option plan at any time during his employment
with the Company shall be fully vested as of Employee's
Termination Date.

     For purposes of this Agreement:

          (x)  A "Change in Control" of the Company shall mean a
change in control of a nature that would be required to be
reported in response to current Item 5(f) of Schedule 14A of
Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934, as
amended and as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "1934
Act"); provided that, without limitation, such a change in
control shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) a third person,
including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934
Act, becomes the beneficial owner, as defined by Rule 13(d)(3)
under the 1934 Act as in effect on the date of this Agreement, of
securities of any class or classes of the Company representing
30% or more of the voting power of the Company's then outstanding
securities; or (ii) the Company is a party to a merger or other
business combination pursuant to which the Company does not
survive or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation
or otherwise does not remain an independent corporation; or (iii)
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold or
otherwise disposed of; or (iv) at any time less than a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
persons who were either nominated for election by the Board or
were elected by the Board, or otherwise less than a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Company shall be persons who are
independent of any third person referred to in subparagraph (i)
above of this paragraph (x); or (v) any combination of the
foregoing occurs.

          (y)  An "Employee Status Change" shall mean the
happening of any one or more of the following events after a
Change in Control of the Company;

               (i)       Without the express written consent of
               Employee, the Company's assignment of Employee to
any duties inconsistent with his positions, duties,
responsibilities or status with the Company immediately prior to
the Change in Control or a substantial reduction of his duties or
responsibilities, in each case as reasonably determined by
Employee; or


                    (ii)      A reduction by the Company in
Employee's salary in effect immediately prior to the change in
Control; or

               (iii)     Any failure by the Company to continue
in effect any benefit plan or arrangement (including, without
limitation, the Company's group life, medical, accident and
disability plans and perquisites afforded executive employees) in
which Employee is participating at the time of a Change in
Control (or any other plans or arrangements provided Employee
with substantially similar benefits) (referred to in this
Agreement as "Benefit Plans"), or the taking of any action by the
Company which would adversely affect Employee's participation in
or materially reduce his benefits under any Benefit Plan or
deprive him of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by him at the
time of a Change in Control; or

               (iv)      Any failure by the Company to continue
in effect any plan or arrangement to receive securities of the
Company (including, without limitation, the Company's Stock
Option Plans, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Restricted Stock
Plan, and any other plan or arrangement to receive and exercise
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or
grants thereof) in which Employee is participating at the time of
a Change in Control (or any other plans or arrangements providing
Employee with substantially similar benefits) (referred to in
this Agreement as "Securities Plans") or the taking of any action
by the Company which would adversely affect Employee's
participation in or materially reduce his benefits under any such
Securities Plan as his participation therein is in effect at the
time of a Change in Control; or

               (v)       Any failure by the Company's Board or
stockholders, as the case may be, to re-elect Employee to the
corporate office or position held by him immediately prior to the
Change in Control or his removal from any such office including
any seat held at such time on the Company's Board of Directors;
or

                    (vi)      Any breach by the Company of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or any failure by the Company
to carry out any of its obligations hereunder.

          (z)  The "Severance Benefit" shall mean an amount equal
to three (3) times the greater of (i) the average of Employee's
average annual taxable compensation, including bonuses, from the
Company as reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 during
the three-year period immediately preceding Employee's
Termination Date (or such shorter period that Employee has been
employed by the Company) or (ii) Employee's current year
compensation plus a bonus amount assumed to equal 75% of such
current year salary; provided, however, that if such Severance
Benefit, either alone or together with any other payments or
benefits which Employee has the right to receive from the
Company, would constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G of the Code), such Severance Benefit shall be
reduced to the largest amount as will result in no portion of the
Severance Benefit being subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code.  The Severance Benefit shall be payable
in thirty-six (36) equal monthly installments commencing on the
first day of the month following Employee's Termination Date.

     Section 6.  Confidentiality Agreement.  Upon execution of
this Agreement, Employee has entered into and agrees to abide by
the terms of the agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A relating to confidentiality, non-disclosure and related
obligations of Employee to the Company.

     Section 7.  Additional Provisions Relating to Change in
Control.

     (a)  In the event that a third person commences a tender or
exchange offer or a proxy solicitation to elect directors of the
Company with a view to effecting a Change in Control of the
Company, Employee agrees that he shall not voluntarily leave the
employ of the Company, and shall render the services contemplated
in this Agreement, until the third person has abandoned or
terminated such efforts to effect a Change in Control of the
Company or until after such a Change in Control of the Company
has been effected.

     (b)  In order to ensure the payment of the Severance Benefit
provided for in this Agreement, immediately following the
commencement of any action by a third party with the aim of
effecting a Change in Control of the Company, or the publicly-
announced threat by a third party to commence any such action,
the Company shall establish an irrevocable standby Letter of
Credit issued by a national banking association in favor of
Employee in the amount of the Severance Benefit that would have
been paid to Employee under this Agreement if Employee's
Termination Date had occurred on the date of commencement, or
publicly-announced threat of commencement, of such action by the
third party.  Such Letter of Credit shall provide that the issuer
thereof, subject only to Employee's written certification to such
issuer that Employee is entitled to payment of the Severance
Benefit pursuant to this Agreement and that the Company shall
have failed to commence payment of such benefit to Employee,
shall have the unconditional obligation to pay the amount of such
Letter of Credit to Employee in thirty-six (36) equal monthly
installments commencing on the first day of the month following
Employee's Termination Date.  In the event that subsequent to
commencement of such installment payments to Employee pursuant to
such Letter of Credit (i) the Company and Employee shall mutually
agree that Employee shall not have been entitled to payment of
the Severance Benefit pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) a court
of competent jurisdiction shall finally adjudge Employee not to
have been entitled to payment of such Severance Benefit and such
judgment shall have been affirmed on appeal or shall not have
been appealed within any time period specified for the filing of
an appeal, Employee shall promptly pay to the Company the total
amount previously paid to Employee by the issuer of such Letter
of Credit and no further payment shall be made to Employee
pursuant to such Letter of Credit.

     Section 8.  Miscellaneous.

     8.1  Withholding.  Notwithstanding any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, all amounts payable by the Company
to Employee hereunder shall be subject to withholding of such
sums related to taxes as the Company may be required to withhold
pursuant to applicable law or regulation.

     8.2  No Obligation to Mitigate Damages; No Effect on Other
Contractual Rights.

          (a)  Employee shall not be required to mitigate damages
or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by
seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of
any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any
compensation earned by Employee as a result of employment by
another employer after Employee's Termination Date or otherwise.

          (b)  The provisions of this Agreement, and any payment
provided for hereunder, shall not reduce any amounts otherwise
payable, or in any way diminish Employee's existing rights, or
rights which would accrue solely as a result of the passage of
time, under any Benefit Plan, Securities Plan, employment
agreement or other contract, plan or arrangement.

     8.3  Payment of Certain Costs of Employee.  If a dispute
arises regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this
Agreement, and if Employee shall prevail in such dispute, all
legal fees and expenses incurred by Employee in contesting or
disputing any such termination or seeking to obtain or enforce
any right or benefit provided for in this Agreement or in
otherwise pursuing his claim shall be paid by the Company.  The

Company further agrees to pay Employee pre-judgment interest on
any money judgment obtained by Employee in such a proceeding
calculated at the prime rate of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina,
N.A., Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as in effect from time to
time from the date that payment(s) to Employee should have been
made under this Agreement.

     8.4  Binding Effect.

          (a)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
shall be binding upon Employee and his executor, administrator,
heirs, personal representative and assigns, and the Company and
its successors and assigns; provided, however, that Employee
shall not be entitled to assign or delegate any of his rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an

hereof and is the complete and exclusive statement of the terms
