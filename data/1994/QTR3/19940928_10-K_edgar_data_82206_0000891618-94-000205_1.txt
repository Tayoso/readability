                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
(A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
 
     Raychem Corporation, founded in 1957, is a broadly based materials science
company serving both domestic and international markets. The terms "company" or
"Raychem" mean Raychem Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
     The company develops, manufactures, and sells a variety of high-performance
products used by customers in the aerospace, automotive, cable television,
commercial electronics, communications, computer, construction, defense,
industrial infrastructure, mass transit, medical, and telephone industries. The
company's Raynet Corporation subsidiary ("Raynet") delivers fiber-optic
distribution systems for voice, video, and data to telecommunications network
operators.
 
     For information regarding restructuring actions, see the Note entitled
"Restructuring and Divestitures" and the section entitled "Financial Review" of
the company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders (the "1994 Annual Report"),
which is incorporated herein by reference and is included in this filing as
Exhibit 13.
 
(B) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
     The company's business is organized into four industry segments designated
as electronics, industrial, telecommunications (collectively referred to as the
"core business"), and Raynet. For financial and other information concerning the
company's industry segments, see the Note entitled "Business Segments" and the
section entitled "Financial Review" of the 1994 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference and is included in this filing as Exhibit 13.
 
(C) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
     For information regarding operating results, principal products produced,
and industries served by the company's industry segments, see the Note entitled
"Business Segments" and the section entitled "Financial Review" of the 1994
Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and is included in this
filing as Exhibit 13. For information regarding the status of Raynet, see the
Note entitled "Raynet" and the section entitled "Financial Review" of the 1994
Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and is included in this
filing as Exhibit 13.
 
METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION
 
     The products of the company's industry segments are marketed primarily
through Raychem's worldwide sales force as well as through outside distribution
channels both within and outside the United States.
 
SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
 
     Materials required by the company's industry segments in their continuing
manufacturing operations, or substitutes for such materials, are generally
available from multiple sources worldwide. No significant delays have been
experienced by the company in obtaining the materials needed to satisfy its
requirements.
 
PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
 
     The company applies for patents in the United States and other countries,
as appropriate, to protect its significant patentable developments. As of June
30, 1994, the company had in force 953 U.S. patents and 3,279 foreign patents,
and had pending 285 U.S. patent applications and 2,829 foreign patent
applications. Patents held by the company in the aggregate are of material
importance in the operation of the company's business. Management, however, does
not believe that any single patent, or group of related patents, is essential to
the company's business as a whole or to that of any of its industry segments.
Additionally, the
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   3
 
company owns and uses in its business a substantial body of proprietary
information and numerous trademarks.
 
WORKING CAPITAL
 
     Information relative to working capital is included in the section entitled
"Financial Review" of the 1994 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference and is included in this filing as Exhibit 13.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
     The company's industry segments sell to many customers. Management does not
believe that the loss of any one customer would have a materially adverse effect
on the business of the company. Approximately 3% of the company's 1994 revenues
were specifically identified by Raychem's customers for U.S. Government end use;
however, the company believes a number of its distributors made sales for U.S.
Government end use which were not reported to it. Additionally, the company made
direct sales to the U.S. Government of less than 1%.
 
BACKLOG
 
     The company's business is characterized by short lead times and the absence
of a significant backlog. The company expects that substantially all of the
backlog at June 30, 1994, will be shipped in fiscal 1995.
 
     Set forth below is the backlog at June 30, 1994 and 1993, for each of the
company's industry segments.

</TABLE>
 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
 
     No material portion of the company's business is subject to renegotiation
of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the
government.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The company's key competitive elements in its core business include:
developing products that provide innovative solutions to customers' technical
problems; providing high product quality and performance; continually
introducing new products as well as improvements to existing products; and
providing ongoing customer support.
 
     While the products of the company's core industry segments are sold in
highly competitive markets, the company's total sales are often a small fraction
of total sales within the markets in which it operates. Raychem's products
compete with those of a large number of companies and divisions within companies
that are both larger and smaller than Raychem.
 
     The company's Raynet subsidiary is engaged in the development, manufacture,
and sale of fiber-optic loop optical carrier systems and integrated operations
support system software. Raynet's products compete with those of specialized
telecommunications companies and affiliates of diversified international
corporations that are both larger and smaller than Raychem. The competitive
features of Raynet's market include emphasis
 
                                        2
<PAGE>   4
 
on product quality, price, and performance in the provision of
telecommunications services for the local loop network.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
     For financial information on research and development expense, see the
sections entitled "Consolidated Statement of Operations" and "Financial Review"
of the 1994 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and is
included in this filing as Exhibit 13.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
     For information regarding the effect of environmental regulations on the
company, see the section entitled "Financial Review," the Note entitled "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," and the Note entitled "Contingencies" of
the 1994 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and is
included in this filing as Exhibit 13.
 
     Additional information regarding environmental administrative and judicial
proceedings is set forth in Part I of this Form 10-K under the caption "Legal
Proceedings."
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     As of June 30, 1994, the company employed 10,769 people.
 
(D) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES
 
     The company's international operations are conducted primarily through
wholly owned subsidiaries that are responsible for sales, distribution and, in
some cases, research, development, and manufacturing activities. At June 30,
1994, these operations employed approximately 5,537 people representing 51% of
the company's total work force.
 
     The company's principal international operations are located in Western
Europe. Although the company's Western European operations are subject to a
number of risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, management
believes that they do not involve significantly greater risks than the company's
domestic operations. The company also operates in the Middle East, Asia, and
Latin America. Although doing business in these parts of the world involves some
degree of risk due to greater economic and political uncertainties, management
believes that the company's spending and exposure levels are appropriate in the
regions in which it conducts business.
 
     For additional information regarding the company's international and
domestic operations and export sales, see the Note entitled "Worldwide
Operations" and the section entitled "Financial Review" of the 1994 Annual
Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and is included in this filing
as Exhibit 13.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
     The company's principal domestic facilities are located in Menlo Park and
Redwood City, California, and in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. Additional
facilities of significance are located in Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland,
Japan, People's Republic of China, and the United Kingdom.
 
     The company owns and leases a total of 6,779,000 square feet of
manufacturing, distribution, research and development, and sales and
administrative facilities worldwide.

  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     On July 6, 1994, the company and Communications Technology Corporation
settled all claims and counterclaims in the company's lawsuit for patent
infringement filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of
California, on November 2, 1992. The settlement is subject to entry of consent
judgment.
 
     On May 4, 1994, the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California entered an Order Granting Summary Adjudication on Certain Issues
and Continuing Motion As to Other Issues in the matter of Raychem Corporation v.
Federal Insurance Company, a lawsuit filed by the company on December 16, 1991,
seeking recovery from Federal, its insurer, of $8.25 million paid by the company
in settlement of a class action securities suit. The Order finds in Raychem's
favor that the indemnification of officers and directors for settlement payments
and defense costs was "permitted by law," that any "allocation" for coverage
purposes between the corporation and the officers and directors is improper, and
that the officers and directors were acting in their official capacities insofar
as the acts alleged to have occurred; further that although Federal has raised
no genuine issue of material fact to the contrary, Federal may conduct discovery
over a six-month period on whether Raychem's indemnification of the officers and
directors was in good faith and whether settlement payments and defense costs
were for matters insurable under the law. Raychem was also granted the right to
re-notice its motion for partial summary judgment after six months. The company
actively continues to pursue its claim that Federal acted in bad faith in
connection with its handling of this claim.
 
     On March 8, 1994, a judgment was entered in the company's favor in a
lawsuit filed on September 9, 1988, in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland,
Canada, Trial Division, Bow Valley, et al. v. Saint John Shipbuilding and
Raychem. The plaintiffs had alleged claims for damages arising out of a fire on
an offshore drilling platform and made allegations attributing the cause and
spread of the fire to heat-tracing and cladding products manufactured by the
company. The decision has been appealed by the plaintiffs. The appeal will be
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   6
 
argued in November 1994. On November 30, 1993, a Petition by joint venturers of
the plaintiffs in the Bow Valley lawsuit making similar claims was filed in the
Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Canada, Trial Division, and was served on the
company on March 25, 1994. A New Brunswick lawsuit filed by Saint John
Shipbuilding against Raychem Canada, Ltd. arising out of the same incident has
been stayed by prior agreement of the parties.
 
     On December 23, 1993, the company and Thomas and Betts Corporation settled
all claims and counterclaims in the company's lawsuit for patent infringement
filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, on
August 25, 1992.
 
     On November 30, 1993, the company filed a complaint in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, against PSI Telecommunications,
Inc. for patent infringement. On January 21, 1994, PSI Telecommunications, Inc.
answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim against the company for
declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid and not infringed, and amended
its complaint and counterclaim on February 4, 1994. No monetary damages have
been alleged. The company believes the counterclaim is without merit.
 
     On August 27, 1993, a Complaint entitled West County Landfill, Inc. v.
Raychem International Corporation; FMC Corporation; Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical
Corporation; Flint Ink Corporation; Stauffer Chemical Company; Rhone-Poulenc
Basic Chemicals Co.; Rhone Poulenc Inc.; Pacific Gas & Electric Company; Union
Oil Company of California; Chevron U.S.A., Inc.; Chevron Chemical Company; Shell
Oil Company; Desoto, Inc.; Occidental Chemical Corporation; General Motors
Corporation; Romic Chemical Corporation; United Airlines, Inc.; United States
Department of Defense; United States Department of Navy was filed in the United
States District Court, Northern District of California. The allegations contend
that the defendants generated hazardous materials which were disposed of at a
site operated by plaintiff. Raychem International Corporation is alleged to have
done so during the period 1975 through 1979 and perhaps at other times. The
complaint seeks recovery of response costs which plaintiff has allegedly
incurred in an amount exceeding $15 million.
 
     On August 19, 1993, a Complaint entitled Creole Engineering Co. v. Raychem
Corporation, Tri-Systems, and Tracer Construction Company was filed in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California. The complaint
seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in excess of $5 million (prior to
trebling) for violation of various statutes, including antitrust and unfair
competition statutes, for breach of contract, and for other tortious acts. The
complaint arises out of a distributor termination by Raychem.
 
     On June 29, 1993, a Second Amended Complaint entitled Unit Process Company;
Brock, Easley, Inc.; Bylin Heating Systems, Inc.; and Fluid Flow Control
Contractors v. Raychem Corporation; Debenham Electrical Supply Company, Inc.;
and K.V.A. Electrical Supply Corp. was filed in the United States District
Court, Northern District of California. The complaint seeks damages in excess of
$5 million (prior to trebling) per claimant arising out of a distributor
termination by Raychem Corporation and contains allegations of violations of
federal antitrust statutes and various Washington State statutes. The plaintiffs
have recently been granted leave to file a third amended complaint. The Unit
Process and Creole Engineering actions will be heard as related actions before
the same judge.
 
     On December 14, 1992, a Complaint entitled Culinary Foods, Inc., et al. v.
Raychem Corporation was filed in the United States District Court, Northern
District of Illinois, asserting liability against the company for alleged
property damage and personal injury (a death) arising out of use of the
company's FreezGard(R) product. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $50
million. The company intends to vigorously defend itself and has filed a
response denying all liability. The matter has been tendered to the company's
insurance carriers.
 
     On July 10, 1991, the company received written notice from the California
Department of Health Services ("DHS") that it intends to issue an administrative
order relating to the clean-up of soil contamination at the company's
administrative and manufacturing site in Menlo Park, California. The company is
currently negotiating with DHS regarding the proposed administrative order. To
date, no administrative order has been issued by DHS.

     The company has been named, among others, as an interested party in
administrative proceedings instituted by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency on March 23, 1989, and as a potentially responsible party in a
matter initiated by the California Environmental Protection Agency on September
1, 1992, each alleging that the company may be liable for costs of correcting
environmental conditions at certain hazardous waste sites.
 
     Legal proceedings tend to be unpredictable and costly. Based on currently
available information, however, management believes that the resolution of
pending claims, regulatory inquiries, and legal proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the company's operating results or financial
position.

                         FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Raychem Corporation:
 
     Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our
report dated July 20, 1994 appearing on page 17 of Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K
(which is incorporated herein by reference) also included an audit of the
Financial Statement Schedules listed in Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. In our
opinion, these Financial Statement Schedules present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements.

                      RAYCHEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
      AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM RELATED PARTIES AND UNDERWRITERS, PROMOTERS,
                    AND EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN RELATED PARTIES
                            YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1994
                                 (IN THOUSANDS)
 
     This schedule includes loans to employees and related parties who had
aggregate indebtedness with respect to such loans greater than $100,000 at any
time during the three most recent fiscal years. Balances at fiscal year-end are
current if due within one year, noncurrent if due after one year.
 
     Loans were provided to listed individuals for various purposes during the
three-year period ended June 30, 1994. Certain loans were made to employees to
enable them to purchase Common Stock, primarily through the exercise of options,
and to pay taxes incidental to such stock purchases. Common Stock loans made
during the three-year period ended June 30, 1994, are typically repayable over a
five-or eight-year term and bear interest at annual rates ranging from 5.0% to
9.1% as of June 30, 1994. Stock loans are collateralized by the Common Stock
purchased by the employees except for listed loans to employees resident in the
United Kingdom which are not collateralized. In addition, loans were provided to
certain employees for housing, relocation, and other assistance with interest
rates ranging from 0% to 9.0%.

Mr. Isaac Stein
Waverley Associates
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto, CA 94301
 
Dear Isaac:
 
     Thank you for taking on the responsibility of chairing the Board oversight
committee for Raynet. Your compensation for chairing this effort will be $25,000
per year. In addition, you will receive a one time stock option grant of 10,000
shares in Raychem Corporation, subject to approval of the Board of Directors at
the upcoming meeting.
 
     Given the current situation at Raynet, we would like you to spend a
considerable amount of time as a consultant in addition to the committee
meetings and obligations. Your duties will include consulting with Raynet
management and Raychem management concerning financing alternatives and other
Raynet related issues. Waverley Associates Inc. ("Waverley") has agreed to hold
you available up to 20% of your time for these duties. Waverley will receive a
retainer at the rate of $32,000 per quarter, commencing January 1 1994, for this
assignment, against a fee of $3,000 per day. The arrangement will initially run
until December 31, 1994, and we will then review it quarterly in advance to
insure it is working as we intend. Waverley will receive a customary indemnity
from Raychem for these consulting services covering liabilities and expenses,
including costs of defense.
 
     Please sign and return the enclosed copy of this letter to confirm this
arrangement, subject to Board approval at the upcoming meeting.
 
Very truly yours,
/s/ PAUL COOK

                              CONSULTING AGREEMENT
 
     This Consulting Agreement is entered into as April 18, 1994, between Raynet
Corporation, a California corporation having its principal place of business at
155 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025, and Robert M. Halperin
("Consultant"), an individual having a home address of 80 Reservoir Road,
Atherton, California 94027.
 
     Consultant is a retired executive of Raychem Corporation (the parent of
Raynet Corporation) whose consulting services are desired by Raynet Corporation,
and Consultant wishes to offer such services. The parties therefore agree as
follows:
 
     1.  Services.
 
     Consultant shall provide advice and counsel to Raynet Corporation, its
parent, and affiliated companies (collectively, "Raynet") principally in
connection with effecting a smooth transition in the sales, marketing and
recruiting functions at Raynet, as requested by the Chief Executive Officer of
Raynet Corporation or Robert J. Saldich. Consultant shall be available on a 20%
time basis to fulfill his obligations under this Agreement.
 
     2.  Compensation.
 
     (a) Retainer.  For the period from the date hereof through December 31,
1994, Consultant shall receive a retainer of $12,500 per each month of this
Agreement, payable monthly in arrears, for the services described in Section 1
above. For the period from January 1, 1995 through November 30, 1995, Consultant
shall receive a retainer of $6,250 per month, payable in the same manner.
 
     (b) Expenses.  Raynet shall reimburse Consultant for reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with the services provided under this Agreement. All
expenses shall be substantiated by appropriate receipts.
 
     (c) Office and Secretary.  From April 18, 1994 through June 30, 1994,
Raynet shall provide to Consultant his current office and a secretary on Raynet
promises. On or before June 30, 1994, Consultant shall vacate his office at
Raynet. Raynet shall reimburse Consultant for (i) reasonable amounts paid to
relocate Consultant's office to another location and (ii) for the rent and
common area maintenance charges on an equivalent amount of space as Consultant
currently occupies and for the cost of secretarial services in an amount not to
exceed to the current cost of providing a secretary to Consultant. The
reimbursement for rent and common area maintenance charges secretarial costs
shall be at a rate of 100% for the period from July 1, 1994 through December 31,
1994 and at a rate of 50% for the period January 1, 1995 through November 30,
1995. Payment by Raynet shall be made within 10 business days of the submission
of an invoice for the covered expenses. Raynet shall not be responsible for the
costs of an office or secretarial services for Consultant following November 30,
1995.
 
     (d) Fringe Benefits.  From the date hereof through December 31, 1994,
Raynet shall provide Consultant with a car, life insurance, health insurance,
and other standard fringe benefits under Raynet's standard benefit provisions in
effect on April 18, 1994 (excluding any additional accrual of benefits under the
Raychem Pension Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan). Such benefits
shall be premised on a base compensation of $500,000 per year. Commencing
January 1, 1995, the only fringe benefit that Raynet shall be required to
provide Consultant is health insurance. Consultant shall be permitted to
purchase life insurance and his car in accordance with normal company policies
at the end of 1994. In the event that this Agreement is assumed by Raychem
pursuant to Section 10 hereof, Consultant shall receive comparable benefits
under Raychem's fringe benefit plans on the same basis.
 
     3. Independent Contractors.
 
     The relationship of Raynet and Consultant established by this Agreement is
that of independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Raynet the right to control the day-to-day affairs of Consultant or allow
Consultant to create or assume any obligation on behalf of Raynet. Consultant
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   3
 
shall be directly responsible for payments to satisfy Consultant's obligations
under all tax laws of every kind, workers' compensation laws, disability and
unemployment insurance laws, and the Social Security Act. Raynet shall not
withhold taxes or any other payroll deductions from any payments made to
Consultant.
 
     4. Inventions.
 
     All inventions, improvements, know-how, processes, and techniques that
result from work performed by Consultant for Raynet or from access to Raynet
Proprietary Information (as defined below) or property ("Inventions") shall be
the property of Raynet. Consultant shall promptly disclose all Inventions in
writing to Raynet. Consultant hereby assigns to Raynet, without consideration
beyond that set forth in Section 2 above, Consultant's entire interest in all
Inventions, and Raynet shall be the sole owner of all patents and proprietary
rights. Consultant shall assist Raynet (at Raynet's expense) in obtaining and
enforcing patents and other forms of trade secret protection on Inventions.
"Proprietary Information" means all information related to Raynet's business
unless (a) the information is publicly known through lawful means, or (b) the
information was rightfully in Consultant's possession prior to the execution of
this Agreement. Consultant hereby represents and warrants to Raynet that
Consultant has no obligation to any third party that precludes or encumbers
Consultant's right to assign to Raynet the full and exclusive right, title, and
interest in and to all inventions.
 
     5. Copyright.
 
     All writings (including photographs) and other copyrightable material
produced by Consultant or Raynet in relation to this Agreement shall be the sole
property of Raynet, and Raynet shall have the exclusive right to copyright such
writings (including photographs) and other copyrightable material. Consultant
hereby assigns to Raynet all original works of authorship that are produced by
Consultant (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement
and that are protectable by copyrights.
 
     6. Confidentiality.
 
     Consultant shall hold in confidence all of Raynet's Proprietary Information
and all proprietary information entrusted by third parties to Raynet. Consultant
shall not disclose, use, copy, publish, summarize, or remove from Raynet's
premises any such Proprietary Information except as necessary to carry out
Consultant's responsibilities under this Agreement.
 
     7. Information from Consultant.
 
     Consultant shall not disclose to Raynet any information that Consultant
deems to be confidential or with respect to which Consultant has a confidential
obligation to any third party. Raynet shall not be obligated to retain in
confidence any information received from Consultant.
 
     8. Non-Competition.
 
     Consultant agrees that he will not, during the period in which he receives
compensation under this Agreement, serve as a consultant to or employee of any
entity engaged in the design, development, use, manufacture, or sale of any
product or product line that is competitive with any product or product line
manufactured or sold by Raynet or Raychem.
 
     9. Term and Termination.
 
     (a) Term.  This Agreement shall remain in effect until November 30, 1995
and may not be earlier terminated (even upon the death of Consultant), except by
the mutual agreement of both parties.
 
     (c) Survival of Provisions.  The provisions of Sections 2 (for any amounts
due but not yet paid on termination), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 of this Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.
 
     10. General.
 
     (a) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between the
parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements between the parties with
respect to the services described by this Agreement. This
 
                                        2
<PAGE>   4
 
Agreement shall not, however, limit or diminish (i) the fiduciary responsibility
of Consultant for so long as he serves as a director of Raychem Corporation, or
(ii) the standard compensation received by Consultant for his services as a
non-employee director of Raychem. Consultant is presently a director and
Chairman of the Board of Raynet. Consultant agrees that he will resign as a
director and Chairman of Raynet on or before June 30, 1994.
 
     (b) Assignment.  Neither party shall assign any right or obligation
described in this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent. In
the event of a sale or other disposition of the stock or business of Raynet,
Raychem shall automatically assume the obligations of Raynet under this
Agreement.
 
     (c) Limitation of Liability; Indemnification.  In no event shall Raynet be
liable to Consultant for any business expense (except as specifically set forth
in Section 2 above), loss or profits and goodwill, or incidental, consequential,
or indirect damages, however caused. Raynet agrees that it will indemnify
Consultant to the fullest extent permitted by California law, consistent with
the provisions of the Bylaws of Raynet and any indemnity agreements between
Raynet and its officers and directors.
 
     (d) Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under
the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements among California
residents, made and to be performed within the State of California.
 
     (e) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one instrument.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of
the date first written above.

                 3.1      General.  This Plan shall be administered by the
Board except during such time as the Board delegates administration to a
Committee pursuant to Section 3.3.

                 3.2      Powers.  The Administrator shall grant Options and
Purchase Rights to eligible Employees and Consultants.  In particular and
without limitation, the Administrator, subject to the terms of the Plan, shall:

                          (a)     select the Officers, Employees and
Consultants to whom Options and Purchase Rights may be granted;

                          (b)     determine whether and to what extent Options
and Purchase Rights are to be granted under the Plan;

                          (c)     determine the number of Shares to be covered
by each Option and Purchase Right granted under the Plan; and

                          (d)     determine the terms and conditions of any
Option and Purchase Right granted under the Plan and any related loans to be
made by the Company, based upon factors determined by the Administrator.

The Administrator may adopt, alter and repeal administrative rules, guidelines
and practices governing the Plan as it from time to time shall deem advisable,
may interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, any Option, Purchase Right,
Option Agreement or Purchase Agreement and may otherwise supervise the
administration of the Plan.  Any determination made by the Administrator

in its sole discretion at the time of the grant of the Option or Purchase Right
or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan or Option or
Purchase Right, at any later time.  All decisions made by the Administrator
under the Plan shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and Plan
participants.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>   5
constraints, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Board may adopt from time
to time.  The Board at any time may revest in itself the administration of the
Plan.

                 3.4      Fair Market Value.  For purposes of the Plan, the
Fair Market Value of Common Stock shall be determined as follows:

                          (a)     If the Common Stock is listed on any
established stock exchange or a national market system, including without
limitation the National Market System of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System, its Fair Market Value shall be the
closing sales price for such stock, or the closing bid if no sales were
reported, as quoted on such system or exchange (or the largest such exchange)
for the date the Fair Market Value is to be determined (or if there are no
sales for such date, then for the last preceding business day on which there
were sales), as reported in the Wall Street Journal or similar publication.

                          (b)     If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a
recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, its Fair
Market Value shall be the mean between the high bid and low asked prices for
the Common Stock on the date the Fair Market Value is to be determined (or if
there are no quoted prices for the date of grant, then for the last preceding
business day on which there were quoted prices).

                          (c)     In the absence of an established market for
the Common Stock, the Fair Market Value shall be the Appraised Value (as
defined in Section 11.1), if available.

                          (d)     In the absence of an established market for
the Common Stock and in the absence of an Appraised Value, the Fair Market
Value shall be determined in good faith by the Administrator, with reference to
the Company's net worth, prospective earning power, dividend-paying capacity,
and other relevant factors, including the goodwill of the Company, the economic
outlook in the Company's industry, the Company's position in the industry, the
Company's management, and the values of stock of other corporations in the same
or a similar line of business.

         4.      Eligibility.  Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to
Employees.  Nonstatutory Stock Options and Purchase Rights may be granted to
Employees and Consultants.

         5.      Shares Subject to Plan.

                 5.1      Aggregate Number.  Subject to Section 10 (relating to
adjustments upon changes in Shares), the Shares which may be issued pursuant to
Options and Purchase Rights under the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate
6,550,000 Shares.  If an Option expires or become unexercisable for any reason
without having been exercised in full, or in the case of a Purchase Right, if
Shares are repurchased by the Company prior to conferring on





                                      -5-
<PAGE>   6
their holder benefits of ownership other than voting rights or accumulated
dividends that are not realized, the unpurchased or repurchased Shares which
were subject thereto, unless the Plan shall have been terminated, will become
available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, if Shares are issued upon exercise of an Option and later
repurchased by the Company, such Shares shall not become available for future
grant or sale under the Plan.

                 5.2      Restrictions.  When it grants an Option or Purchase
Right, the Company shall retain, for itself or others, in addition to any
rights set forth in Section 11 or elsewhere in the Plan, such rights to
repurchase, rights of first refusal and other transfer restrictions applicable
to Shares acquired under the Option or Purchase Right, or shall impose such
other restrictions on the Shares, or on the Optionee or Purchaser, as the
Administrator may determine.  The terms and conditions of any such rights or
other restrictions shall be set forth in the relevant Option Agreement or
Purchase Agreement, or in the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended
from time to time.

                 5.3      Rights as Shareholder.  An Option shall be deemed to
be exercised when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company
in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person entitled to exercise
the Option and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is
exercised has been received by the Company.  An Optionee or Purchaser shall
have no rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares acquired by exercise of
an Option or Purchase Right until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate
entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent) of a
stock certificate evidencing the Shares, which issuance shall be made as soon
as is practicable.  Subject to Section 10, no adjustment shall be made for
dividends or other events for which the record date precedes the date the
certificate is issued.

                 5.4      Certificates.  At the Company's option, certificates
issued to evidence Shares acquired by exercise of a Nonstatutory Stock Option
or Purchase Right shall not include Shares acquired by exercise of an Incentive
Stock Option.  Certificates issued to evidence Shares acquired by exercise of
an Incentive Stock Option shall, at the Company's option, be clearly identified
as such.

         6.      Stock Purchase Rights.

                 6.1      Grant.  As soon as is practical after the grant of a
Purchase Right, the Administrator shall advise the grantee in writing of the
terms, conditions and restrictions relating to the grant, including the number
of shares of Exercised Common Stock, purchase price, and time within which the
Purchase Right must be exercised, which shall in no event exceed 30 days from
the date upon which the Administrator notifies the Purchaser of the grant.





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   7
                 6.2      Purchase Agreement.  Each sale of Shares pursuant to
a Purchase Right shall be evidenced by a Stock Purchase Agreement between the
Purchaser and the Company in a form, and containing terms, conditions, and
restrictions, approved by the Administrator.  The terms and conditions of the
various Purchase Agreements under the Plan need not be identical.

                 6.3      Purchase Price.  The purchase price of Shares under a
Purchase Right shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares on
the date the Purchase Right is granted.

         7.      Grant and Exercise of Options.

                 7.1      General.  The Administrator may grant Options at any
time before the Plan terminates.  The Administrator shall specify the date of
grant or, if it fails to, the date of grant shall be the date of the action
taken by the Administrator to grant the Option.  However, if an Option is
approved in anticipation of employment, the date of grant shall be the date the
intended Optionee is first treated as an Employee for payroll purposes.

                 7.2      Option Agreement.  As soon as is practical after the
grant of an Option, the Optionee and the Company shall enter into an Option
Agreement which specifies the date of grant, the number of shares of Exercised
Common Stock, the Option price, the other terms and conditions of the Option
and any special restrictions on the shares of Exercised Common Stock.  The
terms and conditions of the Option Agreements under the Plan need not be
identical.

                 7.3      Identification of Options.  The status of each Option
granted under the Plan as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory
Stock Option shall be identified by the Administrator and clearly reflected in
the applicable Option Agreement.

                 7.4      Option Term.  The term of any Option shall not be
greater than ten years from the date it is granted.  If at the time the Company
grants an Option, the Optionee owns (directly or by attribution) stock
possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the Option shall
not be exercisable more than five years after the date of grant.

                 7.5      Purchase Price.  The purchase price of Shares under
each Option shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on
the date the Option is granted.  If at the time the Company grants an Option,
the Optionee owns (directly or by attribution) stock possessing more than ten
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the
Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the purchase price shall not be less than
110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.





                                      -7-
<PAGE>   8
                 7.6      Transferability.  No Option shall be transferable
other than by devise or the laws of descent and distribution, and an Option
shall be exercisable during the Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee.

                 7.7      Limits on Exercise.  Subject to the other provisions
of this Plan, an Option shall be exercisable at such time and in such amounts
as are specified in the Option Agreement; provided, that if no exemption from
registration under the Securities Act is available to the Company with respect
to any exercise and the underlying Exercised Common Stock has not been
registered under the Securities Act at the time an Optionee tenders the
documents approved by the Administrator for Option exercise, such Option or
Options may not be exercised until the earlier of (a) the availability of such
exemption, or (b) the effectiveness of such registration.  The Administrator
shall be entitled (but subject to the Optionee's consent except as provided in
Section 10.3) to waive any limitation respecting the time at which all or any
portion of an Option becomes exercisable.

                 7.8      Termination; Death; Disability.  If for any reason
other than death, Retirement or Disability, an Optionee ceases to be employed
by the Company and its Affiliates (and, in the case of a Nonstatutory Stock
Option, by an affiliate of a Parent), Options held at the date of Termination
(to the extent then exercisable) may be exercised in whole or in part at any
time within three months after the date of such Termination, or such other
period of not less than thirty days as is specified in the Option Agreement
(but in no event after the Expiration Date).  If Termination is due to
Retirement or to death or Disability, Options held at the date of Termination
(to the extent then exercisable) may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the
Optionee, by the Optionee's personal representative or by the person to whom
the Option is transferred by devise or the laws of descent and distribution, at
any time within three years of such date in the case of Retirement, or two
years of such date in the case of death or Disability, or any lesser period
specified in the Option Agreement (but in no event after the Expiration Date).

                 7.9      Leaves of Absence.  For purposes of Section 7.8
above, an Optionee's employment shall not be deemed to terminate by reason of
sick leave, military leave or other leave of absence approved by the
Administrator, if the period of any such leave does not exceed 90 days or, if
longer, if the Optionee's right to reemployment by the Company (or any Parent
or Subsidiary or, in the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, an affiliate of a
Parent) is guaranteed either contractually or by statute.

                 7.10     Disqualifying Dispositions.  If Shares acquired by
exercise of an Incentive Stock Option granted pursuant to the Plan are disposed
of in a "disqualifying disposition" within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, the holder of the Shares immediately prior to the disposition shall
promptly notify the Company in writing of the date and terms of the disposition
and





                                      -8-
<PAGE>   9
shall provide such other information regarding the disposition as the Company
may reasonably require.

                 7.11     Modification, Extension and Renewal of Options.
Within the limitations of this Plan, the Administrator may modify, extend,
reprice or review outstanding Options and may accept the cancellation of
Options (to the extent not previously exercised) for the grant of new Options
in substitution therefor.  No modification shall, however, without the consent
of the Optionee, alter or impair an Optionee's rights or obligations.

         8.      Payment and Taxes Upon Exercise of Options and Purchase Rights.

                 8.1      Delivery of Purchase Price.  If, and only to the
extent, authorized by the Administrator, Optionees and Purchasers may make all
or any portion of any payment due to the Company

                          (a)     upon exercise of an Option or Purchase Right,
or

                          (b)     with respect to federal, state, local or
foreign tax payable in connection with an Option or Purchase Right,

by delivery of (i) cash, (ii) check, or (iii) previously owned Shares, or (iv)
a full recourse promissory note of the Optionee or Purchaser of Shares.  No
promissory note under the Plan shall have a term (including extensions) of more
than five years or shall be of a principal amount exceeding 90 percent of the
purchase price of the Exercised Common Stock.  To the extent participants may
make payments to the Company upon exercise of Options or Purchase Rights by the
delivery of Shares, the Administrator, in its discretion, may permit
participants constructively to deliver for any such payment Shares held by the
participant for at least three months.  Constructive delivery shall be effected
by (a) identification by the participant of the Shares intended to be delivered
constructively, (b) confirmation by the Company of the participant's ownership
of such Shares (for example, by reference to the Company's stock records, or by
some other means of verification), and (c) if applicable, upon exercise,
delivery to the participant of a certificate for that number of Shares
purchased less the number of Shares constructively delivered.  Any Shares
tendered pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall be valued by the Administrator as
of the date they are tendered at their Fair Market Value on that date.

                 8.2      Tax Withholding.  Unless the Administrator permits
otherwise, the participant shall pay to the Company in cash, promptly when the
amount of such obligations becomes determinable (the "Tax Date"), all
applicable federal, state, local and foreign withholding taxes that the
Administrator in its discretion determines to result, (a) from the lapse of
restrictions imposed upon an Option or Purchase Right, (b) upon exercise of an
Option or Purchase Right, or (c) from a transfer





                                      -9-
<PAGE>   10
or other disposition of Shares acquired upon exercise of an Option or Purchase
Right, or otherwise related to the Option or Purchase Right or the Shares
acquired.

                 A participant, to the extent, if any, authorized by the
Administrator in its discretion, may make an election to (i) deliver to the
Company a promissory note of the participant on the terms set forth in Section
8.1, (ii) to tender to the Company previously-owned Shares, or (iii) to have
Shares withheld by the Company to pay the amount of tax that the Administrator
in its discretion determines to be required to be withheld by the Company.

                 Any election pursuant to clause (iii) above by an Optionee or
Purchaser subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be subject to the
following limitations:  (1) such election must be made at least six months
before the Tax Date and shall be irrevocable; or (2) such election (x) must be
made in (or made earlier to take effect in) any 10-day period beginning on the
third business day following the date of release for publication of the
Company's quarterly or annual summary statements of earnings and shall be
subject to approval by the Administrator at any time after such election has
been made, and (y) the Shares must be held at least six months prior to the Tax
Date.  The right to so withhold Shares shall relate separately to each Option
or Purchase Right.

                 Any Shares tendered to or withheld by the Company will be
valued at Fair Market Value on such date.  The value of the Shares tendered or
withheld may not exceed the required federal, state, local and foreign
withholding tax obligations as computed by the Company.

         9.      Use of Proceeds.  Proceeds from the sale of Shares pursuant to
the Plan may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes.

         10.     Adjustment of Shares.

                 10.1     General.  If any change is made in Common Stock
subject to the Plan or subject to any Option or Purchase Right granted under
the Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization,
redemption, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split,
liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in
corporate structure or otherwise) appropriate adjustment may be made by the
Administrator as to the maximum number of Shares subject to the Plan and the
number and price of Shares subject to outstanding Options and Purchase Rights.

                 10.2     Certain Corporate Transactions - Purchase Rights.  In
the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a merger or
consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, or other
capital reorganization in which shares representing more than 50 percent of the
shares of the Company





                                      -10-
<PAGE>   11
entitled to vote are exchanged, any outstanding Purchase Rights shall terminate
except when another corporation shall assume such Purchase Rights or substitute
new purchase rights.

                 10.3     Certain Corporate Transactions - Options.  In the
event of dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a merger or consolidation
in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, or other capital
reorganization in which more than 50 percent of the shares of the Company
entitled to vote are exchanged, unless another corporation shall assume such
Options or substitute new options or unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator, outstanding Options shall terminate upon such event.

         11.     Liquidity Events.

The Initiating Holders' Notice may consist of several copies of the Initiating

                          (g)     Liquidity Event shall mean, at the option of

                 11.2     Liquidity Demand Procedures

                          11.2.1  Request; Company Election.

                                  (a)      Request for Registration.  Subject
to the terms of this Section 11, in the event that the Company shall receive
from an Initiating Holders' Notice at any time after achievement of the events
listed in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Company Milestone, but
prior to the date the Company registers a class of equity securities under
Section 12 of the Exchange Act, the Administrator shall cause a nationally
recognized investment banker or other comparable appraiser selected by the
Board and approved by Raychem, to deliver to the Board, within 45 days of the
Company's receipt of the Initiating Holders' Notice, a report containing such
appraiser's determination (i) of the Appraised Value of the Company and (ii) of
what constitutes a Viable Offering, in each case as of the





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   14
date of issuance of such report.  Upon receipt of such report, if the Appraised
Value is equal to at least $750,000,000, the Administrator promptly shall
deliver a Liquidity Event Notice to all Securities Holders.  The Liquidity
Event Notice shall indicate that, after receipt of a Statement of Intent from
each Securities Holder as provided in paragraph (b) below, the Company shall
use its best efforts to effect a Liquidity Event in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 11.  The Liquidity Event Notice shall be accompanied
by a form of the Statement of Intent to be completed by each Securities Holder,
and shall state the likely range of per share prices for the Liquidity Event,
as estimated by the Administrator in its sole discretion, which estimate shall
not constitute a guarantee or binding commitment as to the actual price per
share for the Liquidity Event.

                                  (b)      Statements of Intent.  Within 15
days of the date of the Liquidity Event Notice, each Securities Holder who
wishes to participate in the Liquidity Event shall deliver a Statement of
Intent to the Company indicating the number of Registrable Securities that such
holder wishes to offer for sale in the proposed Liquidity Event (and if no
Statement of Intent is received within such time, such holder shall be deemed
to have delivered a signed Statement of Intent indicating that such holder does
not wish to participate in the proposed Liquidity Event).  Each Statement of
Intent shall constitute a binding commitment on the part of the Securities
Holder signing such statement (i) subject to compliance with applicable
securities laws, to exercise the vested Options necessary to provide the shares
of Exercised Common Stock to be sold by such Securities Holder in the Liquidity
Event (an "Exercise Commitment") and (ii) to sell the Exercised Common Stock
indicated in such Statement of Intent if the Liquidity Event is a Registration
(a "Sell Commitment").  A Sell Commitment shall be revocable if the Company
elects to proceed with a redemption under Section 11.4.1.1 or with an
alternative liquidity mechanism under Section 11.5, rather than with the
Registration provisions of this Section 11.3.  Subject only to applicable
securities laws, an Exercise Commitment shall be binding in any Liquidity
Event, and the Securities Holder shall be required to exercise at such time as
the Administrator may reasonably require.

                                  (c)      Company Election.  The Administrator
shall, as soon as practicable after receipt (or deemed receipt) of such
Statements of Intent, deliver a Company Election Notice to the participating
Securities Holders stating the Board's decision whether to proceed in
accordance with the Registration provisions of this Section 11.3 or to proceed
in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.4.1.1 or Section 11.5; and if
the Board changes its decision on how to proceed, the Administrator shall
promptly provide a revised Company Election Notice to the participating
Securities Holders.

                                  (d)  Updating Statements of Intent.  The
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may allow participation in a Liquidity
Event by holders of Registrable Securities who become





                                      -14-
<PAGE>   15
such holders after the date of a Liquidity Event Notice.  Prior to the
completion of a Liquidity Event, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
permit Securities Holders to increase the number of shares covered by the
Exercise and/or Sell Commitment of their Statements of Intent or may accept
Statements of Intent from Securities Holders who have not previously submitted
them.  Any such Statements of Intent shall be subject to the provisions of
paragraph (b) of this Section 11.2.1.

                                  (e)      Limitation.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect a
Liquidity Event more than once in any twelve-month period.

                 11.3     Registration.

                          11.3.1  Obligations of Company; Obligations of
Raychem.  If the Board elects to proceed in accordance with the Registration
provisions of this Section 11.3, rather than with a redemption under Section
11.4.1.1 or an alternative liquidity mechanism under Section 11.5, the Company
shall use its best efforts to effect Registration of the Registrable Securities
specified in the Statements of Intent.  By voting to approve this Plan as a
shareholder of the Company, Raychem agrees to convert all of the Preferred
Stock it holds at the time of such Registration and to offer in any such
Registration, not less than a sufficient number of its shares of Nonredeemable
Common Stock in order to cause such Registration to be a Viable Offering as
determined by an underwriter selected pursuant to Section 11.3.4(c).  The
foregoing obligations of Raychem shall be binding upon Raychem from and after
the date of such approval.

                          11.3.2  Right of Deferral of Registration.  If the
Board elects to proceed with the Registration provisions of this Section 11.3,
and if the Administrator furnishes to all Securities Holders participating in
such Registration an Officers' Certificate stating that, in the good faith
judgment of the Board, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for any
Registration to be effected as requested under Section 11.2.1, the Company
shall have the right, exercisable one time only with respect to each
Registration requested pursuant to Section 11.2.1, to defer the filing of a
Registration Statement with respect to such offering for a period of not more
than 120 days.

                          11.3.3  Registration of Other Securities in Demand
Registration.  Any Registration Statement filed pursuant to the request of the
Initiating Holders under this Section 11.3 with respect to only Registrable
Securities may, subject to the provisions of Section 11.3.4, include securities
issued by the Company other than Registrable Securities.

                          11.3.4  Underwriting in Demand Registration.

                                  (a)      Notice of Underwriting.  Unless
otherwise determined by the Company, the Registrable Securities covered by the
request of the Initiating Holders shall be distributed by means of an
underwriting, and the Company shall include such information in its Company
Election Notice delivered pursuant to Section 11.2.1(c).  The right of any
Securities Holder to Registration pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall be
conditioned upon such Securities Holder's agreement to participate in such
underwriting and the inclusion of such Securities Holder's Registrable
Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein.

                                  (b)      Inclusion of Other Securities in
Demand Registration.  If the Company or holders of securities other than
Registrable Securities request inclusion in a Registration under Section
11.3.1, the Company, to the extent the Board deems advisable and consistent
with the goals of such Registration, shall offer to any or all of such holders
of securities other than Registrable Securities that such securities other than
Registrable Securities be included in the underwriting and may condition such
offer on the acceptance by such persons of the terms of this Section 11.3 and
may include securities to be issued by the Company in the underwriting.

                                  (c)      Selection of Underwriter in Demand
Registration.  The Company shall, together with all Securities Holders
proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through such underwriting,
and, if applicable, any other person selling securities in the Registration,
enter into an underwriting agreement with the representative ("Underwriter's
Representative") of the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
underwriting by the Board and approved by Raychem.

                                  (d)      Marketing Limitation in Demand
Registration.  In the event the Underwriter's Representative advises the
Company and the Initiating Holders in writing that market factors (including,
without limitation, the aggregate amounts of securities requested to be
Registered, the general condition of the market, and the status of the persons
proposing to sell securities pursuant to the Registration) require a limitation
of the amount of securities to be underwritten, then the Registrable Securities
shall be excluded from such Registration, to the extent required by such
limitation or by any registration rights granted to other persons, pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares indicated in the Statements of Intent.

                          11.3.5  Blue Sky in Demand Registration.  In the
event of any Registration pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Company shall
exercise its best efforts to Register and qualify the securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions as shall be reasonably appropriate for the distribution of such





                                      -16-
<PAGE>   17
securities; provided, that (i) neither Raychem nor the Company shall be
required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of
process in any such states or jurisdictions, and (ii) notwithstanding anything
in this Section 11 to the contrary, in the event any jurisdiction in which the
Registrable Securities shall be qualified imposes a non-waivable requirement
that expenses incurred in connection with the qualification of securities be
borne by selling holders, such expenses shall be payable pro rata by selling
Securities Holders and any other sellers.

                          11.3.6  Expenses of Registration.  All Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with any Registration requested pursuant to
Section 11.2.1 shall be borne by the Company.  All Selling Expenses shall be
borne by the holders of the securities Registered pro rata on the basis of the
amount of securities Registered.

                          11.3.7  Registration Procedures.  The Company shall
keep each Securities Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in any
Registration pursuant to this Section 11.3 advised as to the initiation and
completion of such Registration.  At its expense, the Company shall:  (a) use
its best efforts to keep such Registration effective for a period of 120 days
or until the Securities Holder or Securities Holders have completed the
distribution described in the Registration Statement relating thereto,
whichever first occurs; (b) furnish such number of prospectuses (including
preliminary prospectuses) and other documents and instruments as a Securities
Holder from time to time may reasonably request; (c) use its best efforts to
register the Common Stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; (d) use its
best efforts to cause the Common Stock to be listed on a national securities
exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System; and (e) to the extent not
obtained prior thereto, use its best efforts to obtain approval of the Listing
Application for any Registrable Securities being Registered.

                          11.3.8  Information Furnished by Securities Holder.
It shall be a condition precedent to the Company's obligations under Sections
11.2 and 11.3 and to Raychem's obligations under Section 11.3.1 that each
Securities Holder of Registrable Securities included in any Registration
furnish to the Company such information regarding such Securities Holder and
the distribution proposed by such Securities Holder as the Company may
reasonably request.

                          11.3.9  Conversion prior to Registration.  Pursuant
to Article 2.1.2.2 of the Company's Amended and Restated Artiles of
Incorporation, each share of Exercised Common Stock shall automatically be
converted into one share of Nonredeemable Common Stock upon the closing of a
Registered offering of the Company's Common Stock conducted pursuant to this
Section 11.3.  The Company shall provide instructions for surrender of the
certificates representing the shares to be converted.  On or before the date
specified for surrender of certificates, each





                                      -17-
<PAGE>   18
holder of shares to be converted shall surrender the certificate(s)
representing such shares as provided and, subject to the closing of the
Registered offering, shall thereupon be entitled to receive new certificate(s)
representing the shares deliverable upon such conversion.  Regardless of
whether such certificates are surrendered, all shares of Exercised Common Stock
shall be deemed converted as of the date of the closing.

                          11.3.10 Indemnification.

                                  11.3.10.1  Company's Indemnification of
Securities Holders.  To the extent permitted by law, the Company agrees to
indemnify each Securities Holder, with respect to which Registration,
qualification or compliance of Registrable Securities has been effected
pursuant to this Section 11, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who
controls any underwriter against all claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) to the extent such claims, losses, damages or
liabilities arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement (or alleged
untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus or
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or any document
incorporated by reference therein or in any filing made in connection with the
registration or qualification of the offering under the Blue Sky or other
securities laws of any state, or (b) any omission (or alleged omission) to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, or (c) any violation by the Company of any rule or
regulation promulgated under the Securities Act applicable to the Company and
relating to action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any
such Registration, qualification or compliance; and the Company agrees to
reimburse each such Securities Holder, each such underwriter and each person
who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such
claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, that the indemnity
contained in this Section 11.3.10.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action if settlement
is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that the Company will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage,
liability or action arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) contained in, or omission (or alleged omission) from,
written information furnished to the Company by such Securities Holder,
underwriter, or controlling person and stated to be for use in connection with
the offering of securities of the Company or relates to a prospectus that the
Company was no longer obligated to keep current pursuant to this Section 11;
provided, further that the indemnity set forth in this Section 11.3.10.1 shall
not apply to the extent that any claims, losses, damages, liabilities or
actions arise out of an untrue (or alleged untrue) statement or omission (or
alleged omission) in a





                                      -18-
<PAGE>   19
prospectus if such untrue (or alleged untrue) statement or omission (or alleged
omission) is corrected in an amendment or supplement to the prospectus and if
the Securities Holder or an underwriter fails to deliver such prospectus as so
supplemented or amended.

                                  11.3.10.2  Securities Holder's
Indemnification of the Company.  To the extent permitted by law, each
Securities Holder will, if Registrable Securities held by such Securities
Holder are included in the securities as to which such Registration,
qualification or compliance is being effected pursuant to this Agreement,
indemnify the Company, each of its directors and officers, each legal counsel
and independent accountant of the Company, each underwriter, if any, of the
Company's securities covered by such a Registration Statement, each person who
controls the Company or such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities
Act, and each other such Securities Holder, against all claims, losses, damages
and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based upon
any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained
in any prospectus or Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein or in any filing made
in connection with the registration or qualification of the offering under the
Blue Sky or other securities laws of any state, or are based on any omission
(or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by such
Securities Holder of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities
Act applicable to such Securities Holder and relating to action or inaction
required of such Securities Holder in connection with any such Registration,
qualification or compliance; and will reimburse the Company, such Securities
Holders, such directors, officers, legal counsel, independent accountants,
underwriters or control persons for any legal and any other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss,
damage, liability or action, in all cases to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission
(or alleged omission) is made in such Registration Statement, prospectus,
offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by such Securities Holder and
stated to be specifically for use in connection with the offering of Securities
of the Company; provided, that each Securities Holder's liability under this
Section 11.3.10.2 shall not exceed such Securities Holder's proceeds from the
offering of securities made in connection with such Registration; and provided,
further, that the indemnity set forth in this Section 11.3.10.2 shall not apply
to the extent that any claims, losses, damages, liabilities or actions arise
out of an untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) in, or omission (or
alleged omission) from, a prospectus if such untrue (or alleged untrue)
statement or omission (or alleged omission) is corrected in an amendment or
supplement to the prospectus and





                                      -19-
<PAGE>   20
if the Company or an underwriter fails to deliver such prospectus as so
supplemented or amended.

                                  11.3.10.3  Indemnification Procedure.
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 11.3.10 of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this
Section 11.3.10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof and generally summarize such action.  The indemnifying party shall have
the right to participate in and to assume the defense of such claim; provided,
that the indemnifying party shall be entitled to select counsel for the defense
of such claim with the approval of any parties entitled to indemnification,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, that if
either party reasonably determines that there may be a conflict among the
position of the Company and the Securities Holders in conducting the defense of
such action, suit or proceeding by reason of recognized claims for indemnity
under this Section 11.3.10, then counsel for such party shall be entitled to
conduct the defense of such party to the extent reasonably determined by such
counsel to be necessary to protect the interest of such party.  The failure to
notify an indemnifying party reasonably promptly of the commencement of any
such action, if materially prejudicial to the ability of the indemnifying party
to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party, to the extent so
prejudiced, of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section
11.3.10, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
such party of any liability that such party may have to any indemnified party
otherwise other than under this Section 11.3.10.

                                  11.3.10.4  Contribution.  If the
indemnification provided for in this Section 11.3.10 from an indemnifying party
is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect to any claims,
losses, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and
indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which result
in such claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of such indemnifying
party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
referred to above shall be





                                      -20-
<PAGE>   21
deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by
such party in connection with investigating or defending any action, suit,
proceeding or claim.  Contribution pursuant to this Section 11.3.10.4 shall not
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
Section 11.3.10.4.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

                 11.4     Repurchase of Registrable Securities.

                          11.4.1  By the Company.  The Company may call for
redemption or otherwise repurchase shares of Exercised Common Stock from the
holders thereof as follows:

                                  11.4.1.1  Liquidity Event Redemption.

                                        (a)  The Board may elect, in accordance
with Section 11.2.1, to have the Company redeem all of the Registrable
Securities indicated in the Statements of Intent delivered or deemed delivered
pursuant to Section 11.2.1 at their Appraised Value as of the date of
redemption.  Any such redemption shall constitute a redemption pursuant to
Article 2.1.1 of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.

                                        (b)  The closing of a redemption
pursuant to this Section 11.4.1.1 shall take place as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of the Liquidity Event Notice, but (unless otherwise
determined by the Administrator) not less than six months after the Registrable
Securities have been "at risk" as such term is used by the accounting
profession, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided
that if the Company determines that it must Register the sale to Plan
participants of some or all of the shares of Exercised Common Stock to be
included in the redemption, then the closing shall not take place prior to the
effective date of a Registration Statement covering such shares.

                                        (c)  At least 20 days prior to the
closing of any redemption pursuant to this Section 11.4.1.1, the Company shall
deliver to each Securities Holder who has delivered, pursuant to Section
11.2.1(b), a Statement of Intent indicating a desire to sell Registrable
Securities, a Repurchase Price Notice stating the per share price for the
redemption.  Such Securities Holders shall be required to tender any
Registrable Securities they wish to have redeemed within 10 days of delivery of
the Repurchase Price Notice and the Company shall redeem Registrable Securities
so tendered on the closing date.

                                  11.4.1.2  Employment or Consulting
Termination Repurchase.  The Administrator may elect to have the Company
purchase Registrable Securities held by a Plan





                                      -21-
<PAGE>   22
participant at the time of such participant's Termination (or acquired after
such Termination during the exercise period of any Option or Purchase Right),
by written notice to any such participant or, in the event that such
participant's Termination is due to death or permanent and total disability, to
such participant's representative or transferee.  Such purchase shall be made
within the period ending on the later of (a) 90 days after the date of
Termination or (b) 30 days after the expiration of the exercise period for such
participant's Option or Purchase Rights, and shall be made at the higher of (i)
the exercise price per Share or (ii) Fair Market Value as of the date of
Termination; provided that if there has been an appraisal of the Common Stock
made by an investment banker of national reputation or comparable appraiser
within three months of the date of such determination, the Administrator may
determine that such appraised value is the Fair Market Value as of the date of
such Termination.

                                  11.4.1.3  Repurchase Programs.  The Board
may, at any time and from time to time, establish one or more programs pursuant
to which the Company may offer to redeem or otherwise repurchase shares of
Exercised Common Stock at a price not less than Fair Market Value.

                          11.4.2  Repurchase Closing.  On the date of any
redemption or other repurchase pursuant to Section 11.4.1, the Company shall
transfer to each Plan participant participating in such redemption or other
repurchase by Company check or wire transfer the amount of the redemption or
repurchase price (any such wire transfer shall be to an account designated by
such Plan participant in a written notice to the Administrator at least ten
days in advance), against delivery by such Plan participant of the Exercised
Common Stock being redeemed or otherwise repurchased (or, if applicable, the
Option Agreement or the Purchase Agreement) to the Company or designee of the
Company.

                 11.5     Alternate Liquidity Mechanism.  The Board may adopt a
liquidity mechanism other than Registration pursuant to Section 11.3 or
redemption pursuant to Section 11.4.1.1; provided, however, that the Board
determines, in its sole discretion, that such alternate liquidity mechanism is
not, in the aggregate, materially less favorable to Securities Holders than the
liquidity mechanisms of Section 11.3 and Section 11.4.1.1; and provided,
further, that the Company shall have filed an amendment to the Application for
Qualification of Securities filed with the California Department of
Corporations with respect to the Plan setting forth the terms and conditions of
such alternate liquidity mechanism and shall have received a permit therefor
from the Department.  Any such alternative liquidity mechanism, if a purchase
of Shares by the Company for cash at Fair Market Value, shall constitute a
redemption pursuant to Article 2.1.1 of the Company's Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation.

                 11.6  Right of Co-Sale.

                          11.6.1  Co-Sale Right.  In the event that Raychem
proposes to sell, or otherwise dispose of for value in a single transaction,
Company securities consisting of at least 25 percent of the then outstanding
Shares calculated on an as-if-converted fully diluted basis either (a) prior to
the occurrence of the Company Milestone if the sale price (on a common
equivalent basis) is greater than $6.00 per share or (b) at any time after the
occurrence of the Company Milestone regardless of the sale price, each
Securities Holder shall have a right of Right of Co-Sale to sell a Pro Rata
Share of Registrable Securities held by such Securities Holder on the same
terms as Raychem proposes to transfer such Company securities held by Raychem.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Raychem shall not be deemed to sell a Company
security (and hence no Right of Co-Sale shall arise with respect to such
Company security) to the extent that Raychem has invested an amount equivalent
to the proceeds of the sale of such Company security in the Company within six
months before such sale or Raychem has committed to invest an amount equivalent
to the proceeds of the sale of such Company security in the Company within six
months after such sale.

                          11.6.2  Pro-Rata Share.  A Securities Holder's Pro
Rata Share shall be that proportion which the number of shares of Registrable
Securities held by such Securities Holder bears to the sum of (x) the total
number of Registrable Securities held by all Securities Holders plus (y) the
total number of shares of Common Stock and Nonredeemable Common Stock held by
Raychem (or issuable to Raychem upon conversion of Company Preferred Stock or
other convertible securities held by Raychem).

                          11.6.3  Mechanics of Co-Sale.

                                  11.6.3.1  Notice of Co-Sale.  At least 30
days before the proposed date of a sale or transfer by Raychem of Company
securities that would give rise to the Right of Co-Sale under Section 11.6.1,
Raychem shall deliver a Co-Sale Notice to the Company.  The Co-Sale Notice
shall describe the proposed transfer, including the number and class of Company
securities proposed to be transferred, the proposed transfer price or
consideration to be paid, and the name and address of the proposed transferee.
The Company shall promptly forward to each Securities Holder a copy of the
Co-Sale Notice.  Each Securities Holder shall have the right to sell to the
proposed transferee (or, upon the unwillingness of any prospective transferee
to purchase directly from such Securities Holder, to Raychem) its Pro Rata
Share of its Registrable Securities (determined as of the date the Co-Sale
Notice is delivered to the Company) subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Co-Sale Notice.

                                  11.6.3.2  Notice of Exercise.  A Securities
Holder shall exercise its Right of Co-Sale by delivering a Notice of Exercise
to the Company within 15 days after the delivery of





                                      -23-
<PAGE>   24
the Co-Sale Notice by the Company to the Securities Holders.  The Secretary of
the Company promptly shall forward each such Notice of Exercise received to
Raychem.

                                  11.6.3.3  Inclusion of Shares in Co-Sale.
Raychem shall assign to each Securities Holder who exercises its Right of
Co-Sale as much of its interest in the agreement of sale with the prospective
transferee or transferees as such holder shall be entitled to and shall accept.
To the extent that any prospective transferee or transferees prohibit such
assignment or otherwise refuse to purchase Registrable Securities from a
Securities Holder, Raychem shall not sell to such prospective transferee or
transferees any Company securities unless and until, simultaneously with such
sale, Raychem shall purchase such Registrable Securities from such Securities
Holder for the same consideration and on the same terms and conditions as the
proposed transfer described in the Co-Sale Notice.

                                  11.6.3.4  Conclusion of Co-Sale.  If none of
the Securities Holders elects to exercise the Right of Co-Sale with respect to
the Company securities subject to the Co-Sale Notice, Raychem may, not later
than 90 days following delivery to the Company of the Co-Sale Notice, conclude
a transfer of Company securities on terms and conditions no more favorable to
Raychem than those described in the Co-Sale Notice.  Any other proposed
transfer of any Company securities by Raychem, shall again be subject to the
Right of Co-Sale and shall require compliance by Raychem with the procedures
described in this Section 11.6.3.

                                  11.6.3.5  Registered Offering.  If the Right
of Co-Sale arises in connection with a sale of Company securities in an
underwritten Registered offering, the following provisions shall apply:

                                        (a)  Selection of Underwriter.  Raychem
shall, together with all Securities Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting, and, if applicable, any other
person selling securities in the Registration, enter into an underwriting
agreement with the representative ("Underwriter's Representative") of the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Board and
approved by Raychem.

                                        (b)  Marketing Limitation.  In the
event the Underwriter's Representative advises Raychem that market factors
require a limitation on the amount of securities to be underwritten (or on the
number of securities to be included in the offering by persons other than
Raychem), then Registrable Securities shall be excluded from such Registration
to the extent so required pro rata in accordance with the number of shares
indicated in the Notices of Exercise.

                                        (c)  Expenses of Registration.  All
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a Registered Offering shall
be borne by the Company.  All Selling Expenses





                                      -24-
<PAGE>   25
shall be borne by the holders of the securities Registered pro rata on the
basis of the amount of securities Registered.

                                        (d)  Information Furnished by
Securities Holder.  It shall be a condition precedent to the Company's
obligations and Raychem's obligations under this Section 11.6.3.5 that each
Securities Holder of Registrable Securities included in any Registration
furnish to the Company or Raychem such information regarding such Securities
Holder and the distribution proposed by such Securities Holder as the Company
or Raychem may reasonably request.

                                  11.6.3.6  Conversion Prior to Co-Sale.
Pursuant Article 2.1.2.2 of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation, all shares of Common Stock to be sold pursuant to the exercise
of the Right of Co-Sale shall be automatically converted into Nonredeemable
Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.  The Company shall provide instructions to
all Securities Holders exercising their Right of Co-Sale for surrender to the
Company of the certificates representing the shares to be converted.  On or
before the date specified for surrender of certificates, each holder of shares
to be converted shall surrender the certificate(s) representing such shares as
provided and, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth below,
shall thereupon be entitled to receive new certificate(s) representing the
shares deliverable upon such conversion.  Regardless of whether such
certificates are surrendered, such shares shall be deemed converted as of the
date of the closing.  Any such conversion shall be conditioned upon the closing
of an underwritten public offering or the closing of such other sale or
transfer of Company securities as described in the Co-Sale Notice.

                                  11.6.3.7  Raychem's Obligations.  By voting
to approve this Plan as a shareholder of the Company, Raychem agrees to bound
by the obligations of Raychem provided in this Section 11.6 from and after the
date of such approval.

                 11.7     Subordination; Lock Ups.

                          11.7.1  Subordination of Rights.  The rights of the
Securities Holders and Plan participants under this Section 11 shall in all
cases be subject to any rights of any shareholder of the Company (or any holder
of securities convertible into equity securities of the Company) other than
Raychem, whether a holder upon adoption of the Plan or a party who thereafter
becomes such a holder.  Any inconsistency between the rights of the Securities
Holders and Plan participants set forth in the Plan, any Option Agreement or
any Purchase Agreement and the rights of any such third party shall be
interpreted to give full effect and priority to the rights of such third party.

                          11.7.2  Lock Up of Shares.  Exercised Common Stock
(including without limitation Registrable Securities or other securities that
are either excluded from an underwriting by





                                      -25-

reason of Section 11.2.4(d) or Section 11.6.3.5(b) or otherwise not included in
a Registration of Shares) shall be withheld from the market by their holders
for a period not to exceed 180 days if the managing underwriter of a
Registration so requests and determines advisable to effect a Registered
offering.

                 11.8  Restrictions on Transfer.  The Company does not intend
that a trading market develop in its Shares other than with the consent of the
Company, and has provided the rights granted in this Section 11 to provide
liquidity mechanisms for the shares of Exercised Common Stock granted under
this Plan.  Accordingly, until such time as the rights granted to Plan
participants under this Section 11 have terminated (as provided in Section
11.10), and except as provided by the terms and conditions set forth in the
relevant Option Agreement or Purchase Agreement, Shares issued under this Plan
(or any interest in any thereof) may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred other than either (a) by devise or in accordance with the laws of
descent and distribution or (b) in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 11.

                 11.9     Notices.

                          11.9.1  Forms.  The Secretary of the Company shall
maintain forms for each of the notices to be delivered by Securities Holders
pursuant to this Section 11, including, without limitation, the Initiating
Holders' Notice, the Statement of Intent, and the Notice of Exercise, a copy of
which such forms shall be provided to Securities Holders promptly upon their
written request.

                          11.9.2  Delivery.  Any notice pursuant to this
Section 11 to be given by Securities Holders to the Company shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal office.  Any notice
pursuant to this Section 11 to be given by the Administrator or by the Company
to Securities Holders shall be delivered to the address shown for each
Securities Holder on the books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock
and/or Options.  All notices shall be in writing and delivered, telecopied or
mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid.  Any such notice shall be deemed
effectively given when actually received if hand delivered or telecopied or two
business days after mailing if mailed as aforesaid.

                 11.10  Termination.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board
in its sole discretion, the provisions of this Section 11 shall terminate at
such time as a Listing Application for the Nonredeemable Common Stock has been
declared effective.

                 11.11  Amendment.  Any term of this Section 11 relating to
tax, securities or accounting rules or regulations may be altered by the
Administrator to the extent that changes in such rules or regulations require
or allow.  Any other term of this Section 11 may be amended with the written
consent of Raychem and the Board and the approval by written consent or
affirmative vote





                                      -26-
<PAGE>   27
of the holders of at least 51% of the Registrable Securities.  Any term of this
Section 11 may be waived with the written consent of Raychem and the Board and
by approval by written consent or affirmative vote or holders of at least 51%
of the Registrable Securities or, if such waiver is sought after Statements of
Intent have been delivered or deemed delivered, at least 51% of the Registrable
Securities held by those Securities Holders who indicate in such Statements of
Intent the intent to participate in the Liquidity Event.  If required by
Section 16, such amendment or waiver shall also require the approval of the
Company's shareholders as provided therein.

                 11.12  Assignment.  The Company's rights under this Section 11
shall be freely assignable and its duties shall be freely delegable in whole or
in part, including without limitation to Raychem and/or any other shareholder
of the Company.  The rights of the Plan participants under this Section 11
shall not be assignable unless such assignment has been approved in writing by
the Company.

         12.     No Right to Employment.  This Plan shall not confer upon any
Optionee or Purchaser any right with respect to continuation of employment by
or the rendition of consulting services to the Company, nor shall it interfere
in any way with the Company's right to terminate the employment or services of
any Optionee or Purchaser at any time with or without cause.

         13.     Legal Requirements.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of
this Plan, the Company shall not be obligated to offer or sell any Shares
unless the Shares are at that time effectively registered or exempt from
registration under the federal securities laws and the offer and sale of the
Shares are otherwise in compliance with all applicable securities laws.  Except
to the extent provided in Section 11, the Company shall have no obligation to
register the Shares under the federal securities laws or take whatever other
steps may be necessary to enable the Shares to be offered, sold or transferred
under federal or other securities laws.  Upon exercise of an Option or Purchase
Right, an Optionee may be required to furnish representations or undertakings
deemed appropriate by the Company to enable the offer and sale of the Shares or
subsequent transfers of any interest in the Shares to comply with applicable
securities laws.

         14.     Legends.  Certificates evidencing Shares issued pursuant to
this Plan shall bear any legend required by, or useful for purposes of
compliance with, applicable securities laws, this Plan or the Option Agreement
or Purchase Agreement.  Each certificate representing Shares issued pursuant to
this Plan shall bear a legend to the foregoing effect (and reflecting the
provisions of Sections 11.7.2 and 11.8) reading substantially as follows:

                 SALE, PLEDGE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OR TRANSFER OF ANY
                 INTEREST IN THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED





                                      -27-

                 BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS RESTRICTED BY THE TERMS OF THE
                 COMMON STOCK PLAN AND/OR A RELATED STOCK OPTION OR PURCHASE
                 AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THESE SECURITIES WERE ISSUED.  IN
                 ADDITION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH PLAN, SALE OR
                 OTHER TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS
                 CERTIFICATE MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE TERMS OF AN UNDERWRITER
                 LOCK UP AGREEMENT.  A COPY OF THE PLAN AND ANY SUCH AGREEMENT
                 MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY AT ITS
                 PRINCIPAL OFFICE.

         15.     Financial Information.  The Company shall provide during the
period an Option is outstanding to each holder of such Option a copy of the
financial statements of the Company as prepared either by the Company or
independent certified public accountants of the Company.  Such financial
statements shall include, at a minimum, a balance sheet and an income statement
and shall be delivered as soon as practicable following the end of the
Company's fiscal year.

         16.     Amendments.

                 16.1     General.  The Administrator may amend this Plan from
time to time, subject to the limitation, however, that except as provided in
Section 10 (relating to adjustments upon changes in Shares), no amendment shall
be effective unless approved, within 12 months before or after the date of
adoption by the Administrator, by the written consent of holders of a majority
of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company or the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares
represented, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at a duly held meeting
where (a) shareholder approval is required to preserve incentive stock option
treatment for federal income tax purposes, (b) from and after such time as the
Company registers a class of equity securities under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act, shareholder approval shall be required to meet the exemptions provided by
Rule 16b-3, or any successor rule thereto, or (c) the Board otherwise concludes
that shareholder approval is advisable.  The Administrator may amend or alter
any Option or Purchase Right, but no amendment or alteration shall be made
which would impair the rights of a participant under an outstanding Option or
Purchase Right without such participant's consent.

                 16.2     Tax Benefits.  It is expressly contemplated that the
Administrator may amend this Plan in any respect necessary to provide Employees
with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of
the Code relating to stock options or to bring this Plan or Incentive Stock
Options granted hereunder into compliance therewith.

                 16.3     Outstanding Options and Purchase Rights.  Rights and
obligations under any Option or Purchase Right granted before





                                      -28-
<PAGE>   29
an amendment of this Plan shall not be altered or impaired by the amendment,
except with the consent of the Optionee or Purchaser.

         17.     Termination or Suspension of Plan.  The Administrator at any
time may suspend or terminate this Plan.  This Plan, unless sooner terminated,
shall terminate on April 7, 2003.  No Option or Purchase Right may be granted
under this Plan while this Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.  Rights
and obligations under any Option Agreement or Purchase Agreement granted while
this Plan is in effect shall not be altered or impaired by suspension or
termination of this Plan, except with the consent of the Optionee or Purchaser.

         18.     Shareholder Approval.  This Plan is subject to approval, by
written consent of a majority of shareholders of the Company or affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of
the Company represented, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at a duly
held shareholders' meeting within 12 months after the date the Board approves
this Plan.  Options and Purchase Rights may be granted, but not exercised,
before such shareholder approval.  If the shareholders fail to approve this
Plan within the required time period, any Options and Purchase Rights granted
under this Plan shall be void, and no additional Options or Purchase Rights
shall be granted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned
and majority owned subsidiaries. Investments in entities owned 20% or more but
less than majority owned and not otherwise controlled by the company are
accounted for under the equity method. Other securities and investments are
carried at the lower of cost or market. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete.
This generally occurs at the time product is shipped. Revenue on certain Raynet
Corporation (Raynet) contracts is recognized upon installation and acceptance
by the customer. Other revenues are principally from licensing and royalty
arrangements. License and royalty revenues are recognized according to the
terms of the specific agreements. Effective in 1993, the company reclassified
royalty and license income from "other expense, net" to "revenues."
Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.
The following table details total revenues:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States, except for
operations in highly inflationary economies (principally in Latin America), are
translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates, and the effects of
foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and included as a
component of "stockholders' equity." For operations in highly inflationary
economies, foreign currency translation adjustments are included in "other
expense, net."
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally using the first-in, first-out method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Effective July 1, 1990, the
company adopted the straight-line method of depreciation for property, plant
and equipment placed in service on or after that date. Fixed assets placed in
service prior to 1991 continue to be depreciated using principally accelerated
methods. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated
useful lives of the individual assets and, for leasehold improvements, over the
terms of their respective leases, if shorter.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of
identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 20 years. Patents and trademarks
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their legal or estimated useful
lives, whichever is shorter.
SOFTWARE CAPITALIZATION
The company capitalizes software development costs as resulting products become
technologically feasible. Capitalized software development costs are amortized
over a period not to exceed three years, commencing when the products are
available for general release to customers on a volume basis. At both June 30,
1994 and 1993, the company had $11 million in net capitalized software
development costs. For the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, amortization of
software development costs was $4 million and $1 million, respectively (none in
1992).
INCOME TAXES
The company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FAS 109), effective as of
July 1, 1992. FAS 109 requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method,
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The standard was adopted on a prospective basis, and amounts
presented for prior years have not been restated. The cumulative effect of
adopting the standard as of July 1, 1992, was a $4 million, or $0.10 per share,
increase in 1993 net income.

          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
         Prior to 1993, the provision for income taxes was based on income 
(loss) before income taxes, extraordinary item and cumulative effect of 
changes in accounting principles recorded in accordance with the company's 
accounting practices, as reflected in the financial statements. For those 
years, the income tax effects of timing differences between financial and 
taxable earnings were reflected in the balance sheet as prepaid or deferred 
income taxes.
         Research and development credits reduce the company's tax provision 
in the year in which the credits are utilized for income tax purposes. In 
years prior to 1993, such credits reduced the tax provision in the year in 
which they arose, subject to statutory limitations based on tax liability.
EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
Primary earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and, where dilutive,
common equivalent shares outstanding.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The statement changes
the method of accounting for certain postemployment benefits from a cash basis
to an accrual basis. The statement must be adopted in the first quarter of
1995. The company expects this change in accounting principle to result in a $1
million to $2 million charge to earnings. The ongoing effect on expense and
cash flow is not expected to be material.
ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts
are probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
FINANCIAL PRESENTATION
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1994
financial statement presentation.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain
foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. The related gains and
losses are included in "other expense, net," as they arise.
         The company also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to 
hedge a portion of its foreign equity. The gains and losses on these contracts 
are included in "stockholders' equity."
         Forward foreign exchange contracts at June 30, 1994 and 1993, 
generally have maturities of less than six months and relate primarily to 
major Western currencies. Counterparties to the transactions are typically large
international financial institutions. At June 30, 1994 and 1993, the company
had approximately $586 million and $366 million, respectively, in forward
foreign exchange contracts outstanding.
INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT
On December 8, 1992, the company entered into a three-year interest rate swap
agreement for a notional principal amount of $100 million, involving the
exchange of fixed and floating interest payment obligations. On December 8,
1993, the company terminated the swap agreement. In addition to the financial
risk that varied during the life of this swap agreement in relation to market
interest rates, the company was subject to credit risk exposure from
nonperformance by the counterparty to the swap agreement.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts
receivable.
         The company maintains cash and cash equivalents and certain other 
financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial 
institutions are located throughout the world, and the company's policy is 
designed to limit exposure to any one institution. The company's periodic 
evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
are considered in the company's investment strategy.
         Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts 
receivable are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the 
company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries 
and countries. Credit risk to certain countries is further limited through the 
use of irrevocable letters of credit and bank guarantees. As of June 30, 1994 
and 1993, the company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
For certain of the company's financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable to banks, accounts payable, and
other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair

</TABLE>

The fair value of long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow
analysis, based on the incremental borrowing rates currently available to the
company for bank loans with similar terms and maturity. For forward foreign
exchange contracts, the estimated fair value is primarily based on quoted
market prices of comparable contracts. The estimated fair value of the interest
rate swap is based on its quoted market price as provided by the financial
institution that was the counterparty to the swap.

INCOME TAXES
As discussed in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the company
adopted FAS 109 effective July 1, 1992. Income (loss) before income taxes,

         The company has provided for U.S. federal income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes on the portion of the undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries expected to be remitted. Undistributed earnings intended to be
reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries were approximately $309 million
at June 30, 1994. If these earnings were distributed, foreign withholding taxes
would be imposed; however, foreign tax credits would become available to
substantially reduce any resulting U.S. income tax liability.
         Income from operations in certain countries is subject to reduced tax
rates as a result of satisfying certain commitments regarding employment and
capital investment. The exemption grants for these operations will expire at
various dates through 2010. The income tax benefits related to the tax status
of these operations are estimated to be $5 million for 1994, 1993, and 1992.

         The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended
June 30, 1994, was an increase of $19 million. The deferred tax asset valuation
allowance is primarily attributed to U.S. federal and state deferred tax
assets. Management believes sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the
realizability of these items that a valuation allowance is required.

EXTRAORDINARY ITEM - SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION
In the second quarter of 1992, the company and its insurer reached settlement
with the plaintiffs in a class action securities suit. The company and its
insurer together funded a total of $20 million for the settlement. The
company's funding in this matter, totaling $8 million, or $0.21 per common
share, was reported as an extraordinary charge. The company expects to recover
a portion of this funding, either through litigation or when a definitive
agreement is reached with its insurer, and has filed suit against its insurer
to resolve this issue. There is no tax benefit recognized for the extraordinary
item because it increases U.S. losses.

SALE OF ASSETS
In 1993, the company sold its remaining equity interest in Mitek Surgical
Products, Inc. (Mitek) for $4 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $4
million. In 1992, the company realized a gain of $11 million from the sale of
Mitek stock for $13 million. These gains were included in "other expense, net."
         In the third quarter of 1992, the company sold 57 acres of undeveloped
land at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for $39 million, resulting
in a pretax gain of $32 million.

RESTRUCTURING AND DIVESTITURES
During the fourth quarter of 1992, the company recorded a pretax restructuring
charge of $30 million for the repositioning of certain businesses and
facilities, principally in the electronics business segment.
         In the second quarter of 1992, the company provided a pretax charge of
$8 million to discontinue the operations of the Taliq subsidiary. Taliq ceased
commercial operations in January 1993.
         During the first quarter of 1992, the company decided to discontinue
the operations of its High Density Interconnect (HDI) business, resulting in a
$5 million pretax charge. HDI was shut down in February 1992.

RAYNET

REPURCHASE OF MINORITY INTEREST
On June 24, 1993, the company repurchased all of the convertible preferred
stock in Raynet International Inc. (RNI), a subsidiary of Raynet Corporation
(Raynet), previously held by BellSouth Enterprises Inc. (BSE). As a result of
this $30 million purchase, Raynet and RNI are now essentially wholly owned by
Raychem and its consolidated subsidiaries. The RNI preferred stock was
previously recorded as a minority interest. Accordingly, at June 30, 1994 and
1993, there remains no minority interest related to the RNI preferred stock.
         The excess of Raychem's cost over the fair value of the preferred 
stock has been recorded as "goodwill" and is being amortized over a five-year 
period. Goodwill amortization expense was $1 million in 1994 (none in 1993).
         The company and Raynet remain in an agreement with BSE that requires 
Raynet to pay BSE a royalty based on revenues from certain codeveloped fiber-
optic products. The royalty is based on a variable rate subject to meeting 
certain annual royalty payment levels. Royalty expense under the agreement was 
$3 million and $1 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT
In July 1994, the company announced the signing of a memorandum of
understanding with Ericsson, a Swedish telecommunications company, to create a
joint venture that will design, manufacture, and market fiber-optic access
network systems worldwide. The joint venture, to be headquartered in Menlo
Park, California, will assume the business operations of Raynet. The joint
venture will be owned 51% by Ericsson and 49% by Raychem and will commence
during calendar 1994, subject to completing definitive agreements, obtaining
regulatory approvals, and restructuring Raynet's existing technology agreement
with BSE. If consummated, these transactions are anticipated to result in a net
charge to earnings. The company's interest in the joint venture will be subject
to ongoing payments to BSE.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The company provides postretirement health care benefits to U.S. employees who
qualify for the company's defined benefit pension plan and retire on or after
age 55, until the employees reach age 65. Such benefits are limited to allowing
retirees to continue their participation in the company's group medical plan.
Eligible retirees pay monthly premiums, thus reducing the cost to the company.
         The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than 
Pensions" (FAS 106), effective July 1, 1992. This statement requires accrual 
accounting for all postretirement benefits other than pensions. The company 
elected to immediately recognize the transition obligation as the cumulative 
effect of a change in accounting principle, resulting in a decrease to 1993 
net income of $2 million, or $0.06 per share.
         Prior to the adoption of FAS 106, the cost of providing medical and 
dental benefits to early retirees was expensed as incurred. The cash cost of 
these benefits was not significant in 1992. In both 1993 and 1994, the cost of 
these benefits (determined in accordance with FAS 106) was $0.4 million, 
comprising a service cost of $0.2 million and interest cost of $0.2 million.
         The following table sets forth components of the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation:

         The assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, was 8.25%. The 
assumed health care cost trend rate for 1995 is 11%, grading down to an 
ultimate rate in 2003 of 6%. A one percentage point increase in the assumed 
health care cost trend rate for each future year increases annual net periodic 
postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation as of June 30, 1994, by $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover
substantially all U.S. employees and a number of its employees in foreign
countries.  The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of
service and employee compensation.  The company funds these pension plans when
legally or contractually required, or earlier.

         Plan assets for the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans
generally consist of publicly traded securities, bonds, and cash investments.
Amortization of prior service cost is calculated on a straight-line basis over
the expected future years of service of the plans' active participants.

         On January 1, 1993, the U.S. plan was amended to update the years 
used to calculate past service benefits. The amendment generated an 
unrecognized prior service cost of $5 million.

         In the fourth quarter of 1992, the company included a $1 million 
pension expense, related to early retirements, in the provision for 
restructuring and divestitures.

         The assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation and 
to compute the expected long-term return on assets for the company's defined
benefit pension plans are as follows:

STOCK

REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK
During 1992, the company repurchased 118,000 shares of common stock from former
Series B stockholders for an aggregate price of $3 million. The stockholders
used the proceeds to retire their outstanding Series B loans. All of the
repurchased shares have been reissued under the employee stock purchase and
stock option plans at an aggregate price of $2 million. The $1 million
difference between the repurchase and reissuance prices was treated as a
reduction of retained earnings.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS
The company's employee stock purchase plans provide that eligible employees may
contribute up to 15% of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of
the company's Common Stock. The employees' purchase price is derived from a
formula based on the fair market value of the Common Stock. No compensation
expense is recorded in connection with the plans. During the past three years,
shares issued under the plans were 901,000 in 1994, 1,188,000 in 1993, and
1,792,000 in 1992. At June 30, 1994, a total of 4,979 of the 9,843 eligible
employees were participants in the plans.
         In 1992, the stockholders approved amendments to the employee stock
purchase plans to increase the aggregate number of shares issuable under the
plans by 1,600,000. In 1993, the stockholders approved an amendment to the
employee stock purchase plans to reduce the maximum enrollment period from 27
months to 12 months and to increase the aggregate number of shares issuable
under the plans by 1,400,000. On October 27, 1993, the stockholders approved
another amendment to the employee stock purchase plans to increase the
aggregate number of shares issuable under the plans by 700,000. The total
number of shares reserved for future issuance under the plans was 938,000 at
June 30, 1994.

STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS

         The company has various stock option and management incentive plans for
selected employees, officers, directors, and consultants.  The plans provide
for awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock
purchase rights, convertible debentures, and performance shares. As of June 30,
1994, only stock options had been awarded under the plans. Options to purchase
Common Stock have been granted at no less than fair market value on the date of
grant. On October 27, 1993, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1990
Incentive Plan to increase by 1,700,000 shares the aggregate number of shares
issuable under the plan. At June 30, l994, 808 optionees held options for the
purchase of Common Stock with expiration dates occurring between July 1, 1994,
and June 30, 2004, with an average exercise price of $33 per share.

    facility are reported as originating in the United States due to a change
    in the cross-border product transfer agreement between the United States
    and Mexico.

</TABLE>

         Long-term debt maturing during the five years subsequent to June 30,
1994, is as follows: 1995 - $4 million; 1996 - $212 million; 1997 - $1 million;
1998 - $1 million; 1999 - $17 million; and thereafter - $14 million.
         Assets pledged as security for long-term debt totaled $23 million at
June 30, 1994.
         The company entered into a $210 million private placement debt
agreement in February 1991. This agreement and most of the company's short-term
borrowing arrangements include covenants which, among other things, include a
minimum net worth requirement, a dividend restriction, and a fixed charge
coverage ratio.
         In December 1992, the company entered into a three-year interest rate
swap agreement which effectively converted $100 million of notional principal
amount from a fixed rate to a floating rate. Under the agreement, which was to
mature on December 8, 1995, the company made payments to a counterparty at
variable rates based on LIBOR, reset every six months, and in return received
payments based on a fixed rate of 5.715%. The LIBOR rate for the period from
December 8, 1992, to June 7, 1993, was 3.875%, and the LIBOR rate for the period
from June 8, 1993, to December 8, 1993, was 3.4375%. The effect of the interest
rate swap agreement was to reduce interest expense in both 1994 and 1993 by $1
million. On December 8, 1993, the company terminated this agreement which
resulted in a deferred gain of $3 million to be amortized over the remaining
life of the hedged debt. In 1994, $1 million of the gain was recognized as a
reduction of interest expense.
         Information regarding short-term debt is as follows:

         In addition to short-term borrowings, lines of credit are used for
letters of credit, debt guarantees, and other purposes. The company had no
significant compensating balance requirements or capital lease obligations
at June 30, 1994.

COMMITMENTS
Total rental expense was $39 million in both 1994 and 1993, and $37 million in
1992. The company had commitments at June 30, 1994, to expend approximately $18
million for the construction or acquisition of additional property, plant and
equipment. Annual future minimum lease payments at June 30, 1994, under
noncancelable operating leases are as follows: 1995 - $28 million; 1996 - $22
million; 1997 - $16 million; 1998 - $12 million; 1999 - $11 million; and
thereafter - $52 million.

CONTINGENCIES
The company has been named, among others, as a potentially responsible party
("PRP") in administrative proceedings alleging that it may be liable for the
costs of correcting environmental conditions at certain hazardous waste sites.
At all of the sites, the company is alleged to be a de minimis generator of
hazardous wastes, and the company believes that it has limited or no liability
for cleanup costs at these sites. The company has also been notified by a state
environmental agency that it may be required to investigate the need for
remedial work at one of its manufacturing sites. The company is currently
conducting such investigations on a voluntary basis.
         Additionally, the company and its subsidiaries have been named as
defendants in lawsuits arising from various commercial matters, including
product liability and private cost recovery for environmental cleanup expenses.
The principal product liability litigation involves a variety of claims arising
from the company's heat-tracing and freeze-protection products. The single
environmental cost recovery lawsuit in which Raychem has been named as a
defendant, along with sixteen other corporate and governmental codefendants,
involves the disposal of waste materials at the West Contra Costa County
Landfill in Richmond, California.
         Legal proceedings tend to be unpredictable and costly. Based on 
currently available information, however, management believes that the 
resolution of pending claims, regulatory inquiries, and legal proceedings will 
not have a material adverse effect on the company's operating results or 
financial position.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
================================================================================

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF RAYCHEM CORPORATION

                In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Raychem Corporation and its subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.   As discussed in the notes
to consolidated financial statements, the company changed its methods of
accounting for income taxes and nonpension postretirement benefits in 1993.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
The company reported net income of $2 million, or $0.04 per share, for 1994,
compared to $10 million, or $0.23 per share, in 1993 and to a net loss of $25
million, or $0.64 per share, in 1992.
         Several unusual transactions have affected core business results in
the last three years. Pretax income for 1994 included charges of $6 million for
plant consolidation and severance costs. Results for 1993 included charges of
$17 million for plant closing and severance costs, $9 million in one-time
license fee income, and a gain of $4 million from the sale of the remaining
portion of the company's equity interest in Mitek Surgical Products, Inc.
(Mitek). Results for 1992 included a pretax charge of $42 million for
restructuring and divestitures, and gains of $35 million from the sale of land
and buildings, $4 million in one-time license fee income, and $11 million from
the sale of Mitek stock. Excluding these and other unusual transactions and the
effect of Raynet Corporation (Raynet), Raychem's "ongoing" pretax income was
$143 million in 1994, compared to $136 million in 1993 and $104 million in
1992.
         Raychem's results for the past three years are summarized as follows:

*Primarily for plant consolidation and severance in 1994 and 1993 and for
product line shutdowns in 1992.
         Despite the impact of adverse currency movements, the company achieved
its primary objectives for 1994: continued growth and higher pretax
profitability in the core business. Additionally, the company continued to fund
Raynet with cash generated internally by the core business. Raynet also reached
two important milestones in 1994: significant revenue growth as volume
shipments commenced, and further expansion of its business activities with
NYNEX, a regional Bell operating company.
         The provision for income taxes in 1994 of $32 million reflects an
annual effective tax rate of 95%, which is higher than the 80% tax rate in
1993. The higher tax rate in 1994 reflects higher U.S. losses, primarily due to
Raynet, compared with 1993, which included U.S. non-recurring gains from the
sale of certain investments. The provision for income taxes results primarily
from profitable non-U.S. operations.
         In July 1994, the company announced the signing of a memorandum of
understanding with Ericsson, a Swedish telecommunications company, to create a
joint venture that will design, manufacture, and market fiber-optic access
network systems worldwide. The joint venture, to be headquartered in Menlo
Park, California, will assume the business operations of Raynet. The joint
venture will be owned 51% by Ericsson and 49% by Raychem and is expected to
commence during calendar 1994, subject to completing definitive agreements,
obtaining regulatory approvals, and restructuring Raynet's existing technology
agreement with BellSouth Enterprises, Inc. (BSE). If consummated, these
transactions are anticipated to result in a net charge to earnings.
         The following discussion of the results of operations is based on the
company's business segments -  electronics, industrial, and telecommunications
(which, along with the corporate groups, are referred to collectively as the
"core business") - and on Raynet. The condensed consolidating financial
statements on pages 26-28 supplement the discussion.
CORE BUSINESS OPERATIONS
REVENUES AND GROSS PROFIT
Core business revenues for 1994 increased 2% to $1,404 million from $1,376
million in 1993, which was an increase of 7% over 1992. Revenues would have
increased 7% from 1993 to 1994, and 6% from 1992 to 1993, if foreign currency
exchange rates had remained constant in those years. Gross profit as a percent
of revenues for the company's core business was 50% in 1994, unchanged from
1993 and up from 49% in 1992.
ELECTRONICS
Revenues in the electronics segment increased 4% to $522 million in 1994 from
$503 million in 1993, while constant currency growth was 6%. Revenues in 1994
included $3 million in license fees and royalty income,

FINANCIAL REVIEW - (Continued)
down from $11 million ($9 million of which were one-time license fees) in 1993.
In 1994, decreases in worldwide defense sales were more than offset by growth
in sales of PolySwitch devices and touchscreen products. Several of the
segment's divisions increased business with the automotive market, reporting
higher sales of PolySwitch devices, wire and cable, and molded parts. Prices
generally decreased in 1994 in many of the segment's markets, principally due
to increasing competitive price pressure. Gross profit as a percent of revenues
for the electronics segment increased two percentage points in 1994, primarily
the result of improved manufacturing capabilities and higher volumes for
PolySwitch devices. Restructuring and plant consolidation activities in
previous years also helped to improve profitability within the Thermofit and
Wire and Cable divisions.
         Revenues in 1993 were $503 million, up from $494 million in 1992.
Revenues in 1993 included $11 million in license fees and royalty payments, up
from $5 million ($4 million of which was a one-time license fee) in 1992. In
1993, decreases in worldwide defense sales were offset by growth in sales of
PolySwitch devices to several markets and growth in sales of many of the
segment's products, including PolySwitch devices, to the automobile, computer,
and communications markets. Prices generally decreased in 1993 in many of the
segment's markets, principally due to a shift in product mix from defense to
lower-margin commercial business, and to competitive price pressure. Gross
profit as a percent of revenues for the electronics segment increased in 1993,
primarily the result of cost reductions realized from the segment's prior
restructuring and plant consolidation activities. In addition, improved
manufacturing capabilities resulted in increased profitability on sales of
PolySwitch devices, connector products, and touchscreen products. These
improvements were somewhat offset by additional plant closing and severance
charges in 1993.

INDUSTRIAL
Revenues in the industrial business segment for 1994 grew 2% to $452 million
from $443 million in 1993, while constant currency growth for the segment was
8%. The segment's Electrical Products Division (EPD) increased sales in Asia
and North America. Revenues were also up in Ultratec, the segment's pipeline
accessory division, as it benefited from significant projects, notably in
Mexico and India. In addition, the unusually harsh winter conditions in North
America contributed to North American sales growth for the Chemelex division.
Europe's continuing recession and adverse currency movements moderated the
reported revenue growth experienced across the segment's divisions. Prices
generally declined in 1994 in many of the segment's markets. Nevertheless,
gross profit as a percent of revenues in the industrial segment improved
slightly in 1994 from 1993 due to higher manufacturing yields and improved
efficiency, notably in EPD and Chemelex, partially offset by lower margin
business within Ultratec.
         Revenues for the segment of $443 million in 1993 were up 7% from $413
million in 1992. Revenues for Ultratec grew more than 13%, mainly due to
improved sales to the utility industry and revenues from major pipeline
projects. EPD sales improved because of strong demand in Asia. Sales of
Chemelex products were flat from 1992 to 1993 mainly due to sluggish economies
in Europe. Gross profit as a percent of segment revenues decreased slightly in
1993 from 1992 due to lower sales of high-margin Chemelex products in Europe
and severance charges related to the 1993 downsizing of EPD's Shannon, Ireland,
plant as part of the division's rationalization of manufacturing capabilities.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Revenues in the telecommunications business segment were unchanged in 1994 from
$430 million in 1993, although growth was 6% on a constant currency basis.
Sales growth in Asia, Latin America, and Spain was offset by adverse currency
fluctuations and lower revenues in several European countries. Prices decreased
slightly in 1994 due to increased competition in the segment's market. Gross
profit as a percent of revenues in 1994 for the telecommunications segment -
down over two percentage points - was impacted by adverse currency fluctuations
and the costs of restructuring the segment's European manufacturing operations.
The segment's fourth quarter 1994 revenues were down from those of the prior
year's quarter, due principally to slower spending by customers in Germany and
the U.S. If this trend continues, revenues and gross profit for the segment may
be lower in early fiscal 1995 as compared to those of the prior year.
         Revenues grew 14% in 1993 to $430 million from $378 million in 1992.
The increase in 1993 revenues resulted from increased sales to U.S. telephone
companies and significantly higher sales in Argentina and the People's Republic
of China (PRC). German sales decreased 30% in 1993 from 1992 as the local
telephone company drew down high levels of inventory. Gross profit as a percent
of segment revenues in 1993 was essentially unchanged from 1992. An increase in
the gross profit margin due to a more favorable geographic sales mix was offset
by a deterioration of the Chinese currency.

SPECIAL CHARGES
The company has implemented a number of programs over the past three years to
restructure the core business. These actions are in response to declining
worldwide defense sales, expanding commercial opportunities, and product shifts
within our markets. The company has streamlined manufacturing capabilities,
realigned its sales force, and divested nonstrategic businesses.

FINANCIAL REVIEW - (Continued)
         Major programs have been classified as "provision for restructuring
and divestitures" in the consolidated statement of operations. Periodic plant
closing and severance costs have been included in "cost of goods sold,"
"research and development expense," or "selling, distribution and
administrative expense," as appropriate.

PROVISION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND DIVESTITURES
The core business incurred a pretax charge of $28 million for restructuring in
the fourth quarter of 1992. A significant portion of this restructuring charge
- - $24 million - was due to the electronics segment's accelerated efforts to
realign its business toward a more commercial focus. The segment's
restructuring charge included $13 million for severance costs, primarily
related to the commercial reorientation of the sales force and reconfiguration
of electronics into three functionally integrated divisions. The remaining
electronics charge of $11 million related to plant consolidations and the
shutdown of unprofitable product lines. In addition, in the industrial segment,
EPD provided $3 million for the relocation of part of its Menlo Park,
California, operations to Delaware and for other plant consolidations. In
total, these actions provided for a workforce reduction of approximately 460
employees.
         In the fourth quarter of 1992, the company completed the sale of the
fluid fittings portion of its shape-memory alloy business for $1 million in
cash and a promissory note for $3 million. The company retained the portion of
the business devoted to the manufacturing of components for surgical
instruments and other products for the medical market.
         In the second quarter of 1992, the company provided $8 million to
discontinue the operations of its Taliq subsidiary. Included in the charge
were severance payments and estimated operating losses through the anticipated
shutdown date. Taliq ceased commercial operations in January 1993.
         In the first quarter of 1992, the company concluded that a sale of the
High Density Interconnect (HDI) unit of Advanced Packaging Systems could not be
completed at an acceptable selling price, and provided $5 million to
discontinue operations. HDI was shutdown in February 1992.

SEVERANCE AND OTHER CHARGES
In 1994, the company's telecommunications business segment incurred a $6
million charge for the restructuring of its European manufacturing operations,
primarily related to a workforce reduction of approximately 90 employees. The
$6 million charge, reflected as $4 million in "cost of goods sold" and $2
million in "selling, distribution and administrative expense," is expected to
result in $4 million of cost savings in 1995. Further actions to restructure
manufacturing, improve profitability, and address the changing
telecommunications marketplace are being considered.
         In 1993, the company's electronics and industrial business segments
incurred $17 million in severance and plant shutdown costs as part of the
continued rationalization of manufacturing capabilities. Among other actions,
the electronics segment provided for the shutdown of its Puerto Rico plant and
the industrial segment for the downsizing of its Shannon, Ireland, facility.
These actions provided for a workforce reduction of approximately 425
employees. The charge was reported as $11 million in "cost of goods sold" and
$6 million in "selling, distribution and administrative expense."

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Raychem continues to invest in product development. Research and development
(R&D) expense for the core business totaled $95 million in 1994, up from $89
million in 1993 and $85 million in 1992. R&D expense represented 7% of revenues
in 1994, compared to 6% in 1993 and 7% in 1992.

SELLING, DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE
Selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) expense as a percent of
revenues was 32% in 1994, unchanged from 1993 and 1992. While the percentage
of revenues was unchanged, SD&A expenses in 1994 and 1993 reflect the
reinstatement of salary increases and bonus payments. The telecommunications
business segment incurred higher spending as a percentage of revenues in 1993
compared to 1992 to support increased sales activity in Latin America and Asia,
while electronics' spending decreased as a result of prior restructuring
actions.

OTHER EXPENSE, NET
Other expense, net, consists primarily of amortization of intangible assets,
net foreign exchange gains and losses, bank charges, gains and losses on the
disposition of fixed assets and investments, and certain other nonoperating
items. Other expense, net of income items, was $8 million in 1994, $11 million
in 1993, and $5 million in 1992. The decrease from 1993 to 1994 is due
principally to lower net foreign exchange losses. The increase from 1992 to
1993 is primarily due to increased net foreign exchange losses and lower gains
on the sale of Mitek stock.

INCOME TAXES
The core business' provision for income taxes was $32 million, $31 million, and
$37 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  The provision for income
taxes in each of these years resulted primarily from profitable non-U.S.
operations. The provision for income taxes in 1994 was higher than in 1993 due
to higher non-U.S. income. The provision for income taxes in 1993 was lower
than in 1992 due to reduced operating profit from European operations.

                        FINANCIAL REVIEW - (Continued)

EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
In the second quarter of 1992, the company recorded an $8 million extraordinary
charge reflecting the company's funding of a class action shareholder suit
settlement. For details, see "Extraordinary Item - Settlement of Class Action
Litigation" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Effective July 1, 1992, the company adopted two new standards of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"
requires accrual accounting for the expected future cost of company-provided
health care for retirees. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," changed the method of accounting for income
taxes to an asset and liability method from a deferred method. The net
cumulative effect of adopting these two standards was to increase 1993 net
income by $2 million. See the notes to the consolidated financial statements
for details.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The statement changes
the method of accounting for certain postemployment benefits from a cash to an
accrual basis. The statement must be adopted in the first quarter of 1995. The
company expects this change in accounting principle to result in a $1 million
to $2 million charge to earnings. The ongoing effect on expense and cash flow
is not expected to be material.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
It is the company's policy to take responsibility for protecting the
environment and to comply with all governmental regulations. Such regulations
continue to evolve throughout the world, and changes in regulation can affect
the company's manufacturing processes as well as the cost, availability, and
use of raw materials. The company does not expect compliance with environmental
regulations to have a material effect on capital expenditures or operating
results in 1995; however, changes in regulation or in the availability or cost
of raw materials, or other unknown factors or events, may have a material
adverse effect on capital expenditures or operating results.
RAYNET OPERATIONS
Revenues at Raynet increased to $58 million in 1994 from $10 million in 1993
and $17 million in 1992. Revenues in 1994 principally resulted from the
previously announced OPAL '93 contract with the German telephone company,
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBPT), and volume shipments to NYNEX. Revenues in
1993 were derived primarily from field trial installations, first office
applications, and RIDES software licensing arrangements. Results for 1992
included revenues from development contracts for European markets and trial
installations in both the U.S. and Europe.
         R&D expense at Raynet was $41 million, $40 million, and $55 million in
1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. The decrease in R&D expense in 1993 from
1992 represents a shift of costs to "cost of goods sold" as Raynet commenced
its transition from the development phase to commercial production.
         Raynet's SD&A expense increased to $39 million in 1994 from $35
million in 1993 because of higher international sales and marketing spending,
and employee severance costs. Raynet's SD&A expense increased to $35 million in
1993 from $30 million in 1992 in support of increased field trial activity and
in preparation for volume shipments.
         Net interest expense of $3 million in both 1993 and 1992 was
principally related to an investment in Raynet International by BSE (see the
"Raynet" note to the consolidated financial statements). Due to Raychem's
repurchase of BSE's interest, this amount was paid directly to Raychem in 1994.
         Raynet capitalized $4 million, $8 million, and $4 million of software
development costs in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively, for its domestic and
international operating systems and system support software. Amortization of
certain of these costs began in 1993 and 1994 as the related products were made
available for sale.
         In the second quarter of 1994, Raynet recorded a $2 million severance
provision reflecting a restructuring and workforce reduction of approximately
80 people throughout the organization. Raynet recorded a $1 million
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 1992 for the severance of
approximately 40 people to realign the employee skill mix to focus on volume
commercial sales.
         In the third quarter of 1993, Raynet commenced activities associated
with the previously announced OPAL '93 contract with DBPT to supply
fiber-in-the-local-loop equipment and related installation services to the
eastern states of Germany. This contract is for approximately 48,500 lines.
Billings for installation services provided by subcontractors have been
recorded as an offset to the related project expense. Product sales revenue on
this contract is recognized as product is installed and accepted by the
customer. In 1994, all of the product under this contract was shipped. Revenue
was recognized for approximately 35,000 lines. Revenue on the balance of the
contract is expected to be recognized in the second half of calendar 1994
following installation and customer acceptance.

<PAGE>   25
                        FINANCIAL REVIEW - (Continued)

         In June 1993, Raynet received a contract award from DBPT for equipment
and related installation of approximately 100,000 lines under the OPAL '94
program. Shipments and installation work under this contract will begin in the
second half of calendar 1994.

         In August 1993, Raynet received an order from NYNEX for the deployment
of approximately 130,000 lines in the northeastern United States. In 1994,
revenue was recognized for approximately 75,000 lines. Revenue for the balance
of the order will be recognized through the second half of calendar 1994.

         In July 1994, Raynet and Pulse Communications, Inc., a subsidiary of
Hubbell Incorporated, terminated their cooperative marketing and development
arrangement to develop and sell an integrated loop access system. The
development and marketing of this product will become part of the proposed
joint venture with Ericsson.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CONSOLIDATED
The company met its objective of funding its investment in Raynet with cash
generated by the core business. Debt net of cash increased by $56 million to
$197 million at June 30, 1994, from $142 million at June 30, 1993. Debt net of
cash increased by $33 million in 1993. The increase in debt net of cash in 1994
resulted from increases in accounts receivable and inventories, higher capital
spending, and a $20 million funding of the company's U.S. pension plan, offset
by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lower tax payments,
and the effect of a large tax refund in the United Kingdom. The 1993 increase
in debt net of cash resulted from improved operating profit, offset by
increased tax payments, the $30 million repurchase of Raynet's minority
interest (see below), increased spending on restructuring and divestitures, and
lower proceeds from the sale of land and investments.

         In June 1993, Raychem repurchased all of the preferred stock in Raynet
International Inc. (RNI), a subsidiary of Raynet, previously held by BSE. As a
result of this $30 million purchase, Raynet and RNI are now essentially wholly
owned by the company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, at June
30, 1994 and 1993, there remains no minority interest related to the RNI
preferred stock.

         Net interest expense was $13 million in 1994, compared to $15 million
in both 1993 and 1992. Net interest expense was lower in 1994 due to the
payment of the RNI preferred stock dividend by Raynet directly to Raychem.

         In 1993, the company received $4 million from the sale of the
remaining portion of the company's investment in Mitek and $7 million from the
sale of various fixed assets.  The company received $56 million from asset
sales in 1992, primarily from the sale of undeveloped land at its Menlo Park,
California, headquarters for $39 million in the third quarter and from the sale
of Mitek stock for $12 million.
    
    
    
    
    
     
     
      
     
     
    
     
    
     
     
     
     
     
      
      
      
     
     
     
     
     
      
     
      
      
     
     
      
      
      
      
      
      
     

         In February 1991, the company entered into a $210 million privately
placed debt agreement. The borrowing carries an interest rate of 9.55% and
matures on March 1, 1996. This agreement and most of the company's short-term
borrowing arrangements include covenants which, among other things, include a
minimum net worth requirement, a dividend restriction, and a fixed charge
coverage ratio. The company may choose to refinance this debt before maturity
and anticipates no problem in doing so. Refinancing the debt prior to maturity
would result in a prepayment penalty and a corresponding charge to earnings,
but it is anticipated that interest expense would be reduced in future periods.

         In December 1992, the company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement with a financial institution. The swap agreement effectively
converted $100 million of notional principal amount from a fixed to a floating
interest rate. The effect of this interest rate swap was to reduce net interest
expense in both 1993 and 1994 by $1 million. In December 1993, the company
terminated the swap agreement. The termination resulted in a gain of $3
million, which has been deferred and will be amortized over the remaining life
of the hedged debt.

         Proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock to employees participating
in the company's employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans amounted
to $34 million in 1994. The company's quarterly cash dividend has been paid
consistently since the second quarter of 1978. During 1994, the company paid
$14 million in dividends to its stockholders, and expects to continue to pay
dividends in the foreseeable future.

         At June 30, 1994, the company had $78 million in cash and cash
equivalents, $315 million in committed credit facilities (of which $3 million
was utilized), and $168 million in various uncommitted credit facilities (of
which $42 million was utilized). The combination of cash and cash equivalents,
available lines of credit, and future cash flows from operations are expected
to be sufficient to satisfy substantially all of the company's needs for
working capital, normal capital expenditures, and anticipated dividends. The
future cash requirements of Raynet will be determined as the definitive
agreements and terms of the proposed Ericsson joint venture are finalized. The
proposed joint venture with Ericsson should reduce the company's losses in 1995
resulting from Raynet's operations, and lower its Raynet funding requirements.

CORE BUSINESS
Cash provided by operations in the core business improved to $151 million in
1994 from $126 million in 1993, but was down from $159 million in 1992. The
increase in 1994 resulted from decreased spending for restructuring and
divestitures, lower tax payments, and a large tax refund in the United Kingdom,
partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and a $20 million funding
of the U.S. pension plan. The decrease in 1993

                        FINANCIAL REVIEW - (Continued)

resulted from improved operating profits offset by increased tax payments and
increased spending on restructuring and divestitures.
         Inventory as measured by the number of days of inventory on hand
improved to 114 days for 1994 from 117 days for 1993.  Receivables as measured
by the number of billing days outstanding were 65 days at June 30, 1994, up
from 54 days at June 30, 1993.  The increase in receivables days outstanding
resulted from changes in receivables mix and collection patterns among certain
countries where customary payment terms are protracted.
         Capital expenditures as a percent of revenues were 7% in 1994,
compared with 6% in both 1993 and 1992. Investments in core business property,
plant and equipment totaled $93 million, $79 million, and $80 million in 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively. The increase in 1994 was due to spending on a
number of projects, including new manufacturing facilities in Japan and the
PRC, as well as on new PolySwitch capacity in Menlo Park. Capital expenditures
in 1995 are expected to be about 7% of revenues.

RAYNET
Net cash used in operating and investing activities at Raynet increased to $136
million in 1994, up from $80 million in 1993 and $107 million in 1992. The
higher cash needs in 1994 resulted from a larger operating loss and increases
in accounts receivable and inventories as volume shipments commenced. The lower
cash needs in 1993 resulted from the collection of a $12 million receivable
from DBPT for development contracts and lower capital expenditures. The future
cash requirements of Raynet will be determined as the definitive agreements and
terms of the proposed Ericsson joint venture are finalized.
         Capital expenditures totaled $11 million in both 1994 and 1993,
compared to $13 million in 1992. Capital expenditures are expected to increase
in 1995 as further investments are made to support volume deployment.
         In the fourth quarter of 1993, Raynet received a $168 million capital
injection from Raychem. Proceeds were used to pay down existing intercompany
debt and to partially fund expenditures in 1994. The intercompany debt at June
30, 1994, of $122 million is reflected as equity since Raychem intends to
capitalize this debt.
