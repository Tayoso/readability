                                    PART I

Item 1.     BUSINESS.

       General

       Brinker International, Inc.  (the "Company") is principally engaged  in
       the operation and development of the  Chili's Grill & Bar  ("Chili's"),
       Grady's American Grill ("Grady's"),  Romano's Macaroni Grill ("Macaroni
       Grill"), Spageddies  Italian Kitchen ("Spageddies")  and On The  Border
       Cafes  ("On  The  Border")  restaurant  concepts.     The  Company  was
       organized under the laws of the State of  Delaware in September 1983 to
       succeed   to  the   business  operated   by  Chili's,  Inc.,   a  Texas
       corporation, organized  in  August  1977.   The Company  completed  the
       acquisitions of Grady's, Macaroni Grill,  Spageddies and On  The Border
       in February 1989, November 1989, June 1993 and May 1994 respectively.

       Restaurant Concepts and Menus

       Chili's Grill & Bar

       Chili's    establishments    are    full-service    Southwestern-themed
       restaurants,  featuring  a  casual  atmosphere and  a  limited  menu of
       freshly prepared chicken,  beef and seafood entrees, hamburgers,  ribs,
       fajitas, sandwiches, salads, appetizers and desserts, all  of which are
       prepared fresh daily according to special Chili's recipes.

       Chili's  restaurants  feature   quick,  efficient  and  friendly  table
       service  designed to  minimize  customer waiting  time  and  facilitate
       table  turnover,   with  an   average  turnover  time   per  table   of
       approximately  45 minutes.   Service personnel are  dressed casually in
       jeans or  slacks,  knit shirts  and  aprons  to reinforce  the  casual,
       informal environment.   The decor of  a Chili's  restaurant consists of
       booth  seating, tile-top  tables,  hanging plants  and  wood  and brick
       walls covered with interesting memorabilia.

       Emphasis  is placed on  serving substantial  portions of fresh, quality
       food at  modest prices.   Entree selections  range in  menu price  from
       $4.75 to $9.95, with the average  revenue per meal, including alcoholic
       beverages,  approximating  $8.55 per  person.   A  full-service bar  is
       available at  each Chili's restaurant,  with frozen margaritas  offered
       as the  concept's specialty  drink.   During  the year  ended June  29,
       1994, food and  non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted  approximately
       86%  of  the  concept's  total  restaurant  revenues,  with   alcoholic
       beverage sales accounting for the remaining 14%.

       Grady's American Grill

       Grady's restaurants are casual, upscale dinner house restaurants  which
       feature a  broad menu  focusing on  fresh seafood,  prime rib,  steaks,
       chicken  and  pasta entrees,  salads, sandwiches,  appetizers, desserts
       and a  full-service bar.  Grady's  restaurants feature  booth and table
       seating, wood and brick walls, and  brass fixtures.  Service  personnel
       are dressed smartly,  in casual slacks, buttoned-down shirts and  ties,
       to reinforce the upscale atmosphere.

       The restaurant appeals to a slightly  more sophisticated customer  than
       Chili's.  Entree selections range  in price from $5.45  to $16.95, with
       the   average  revenue   per  meal,   including   alcoholic  beverages,
       approximating $10.95 per person.  During the year ended  June 29, 1994,
       food and  non-alcoholic beverage sales  constituted approximately   88%
       of the  concept's total  restaurant revenues,  with alcoholic  beverage
       sales accounting for the remaining 12%.

       Romano's Macaroni Grill

       Macaroni  Grill   is  an   upscale  Italian   theme  restaurant   which
       specializes  in  family-style  recipes  and  features  seafood,   meat,
       chicken and pasta  entrees, salads, pizza, appetizers and desserts with
       a  limited wine  and beer  selection in  most  restaurants and  a full-
       service bar in recent and future  openings.  Exhibition cooking,  wood-
       burning  ovens and  rotisseries provide  an enthusiastic  and  exciting
       environment in  the restaurants.   Macaroni  Grill restaurants  feature
       white linen-clothed  tables, fireplaces, a  pizza oven, sous  stations,
       rotisseries  and prominent displays  of wines.   Service  personnel are
       dressed in white, starched shirts and  aprons, dark slacks, and  bright
       ties.

       Entree  selections  range in  menu  price  from  $6.25  to $15.95  with
       certain specialty items priced on  a daily basis.   The average revenue
       per meal,  including alcoholic beverages,  is approximately $13.50  per
       person.   During the year  ended June 29, 1994,  food and non-alcoholic
       beverage sales  constituted approximately  83% of  the concept's  total
       restaurant revenues, with  alcoholic beverage sales accounting for  the
       remaining 17%.

       Spageddies Italian Kitchen

       Spageddies  restaurants  are casual,  full-service,  moderately-priced,
       family  oriented  Italian  restaurants  featuring  rotisserie  chicken,
       steak and pasta entrees, salads, pizza,  appetizers and desserts with a
       full-service  bar.    Spageddies   restaurants  feature  an  exhibition
       kitchen,  a  wood-burning pizza  oven,  booth  and  table seating,  and
       prominent  displays  of  peppers,  parmesan  and  tomatoes.     Service
       personnel are dressed casually in black  pants and striped polo  shirts
       to reinforce the casual, informal, open environment.

       Entree selections range in  menu price from $4.25  to $12.95, with  the
       average revenue per meal,  including alcoholic beverages, approximating
       $9.25 per  person.  During the year  ended June 29, 1994, food and non-
       alcoholic  beverage   sales  constituted  approximately   92%  of   the
       concept's total  restaurant  revenues,  with alcoholic  beverage  sales
       accounting for the remaining 8%.

        On The Border Cafes

       On  The  Border restaurants  are  full-service,  casual  Tex-Mex  theme
       restaurants   featuring  Southwest   mesquite-grilled  specialties  and
       traditional Tex-Mex entrees and appetizers served in generous  portions
       at modest  prices.   On The  Border serves  "Texas-sized" non-alcoholic
       beverages in addition  to offering a  full-service bar.  On  The Border
       restaurants  feature an  outdoor patio,  booth  and table  seating  and
       brick  and  wood  walls  with  a  Southwest   decor.    On  The  Border
       restaurants also offer enthusiastic table service intended to  minimize
       customer   waiting   time   and   facilitate   table   turnover   while
       simultaneously providing  customers  with  a satisfying  casual  dining
       experience.

       Entree selections range in  menu price from $5.45  to $12.95, with  the
       average revenue per meal, including  alcoholic beverages, approximating
       $10.00 per person.  During the  year ended June 29, 1994, food and non-
       alcoholic  beverage   sales  constituted  approximately   74%  of   the
       concept's total  restaurant  revenues,  with alcoholic  beverage  sales
       accounting for the remaining 26%.

       Restaurant Locations

       At June  29, 1994,  Brinker  International, Inc.'s  system of  company-
       operated, joint venture  and franchised units included 458  restaurants
       located in  43 states,  Canada, Singapore,  Malaysia and  Mexico.   The
       Company's portfolio of restaurants is illustrated below:

                                          June 29, 1994

                                  TOTAL        458

       Business Development

       The  Company's long-term  objective  is  to continue  expansion of  its
       restaurant concepts by  opening Company-operated units in strategically
       desirable markets.   The Company intends to concentrate on  development
       of  certain identified  markets to  achieve penetration  levels  deemed
       desirable by the Company in order  to improve the Company's competitive
       position,  marketing potential  and profitability.    Expansion efforts
       will be  focused on major metropolitan  areas in the  United States and
       smaller market areas which can adequately  support any of the Company's
       restaurant concepts. 

       The Company  considers the restaurant  site selection process  critical
       to  its  long-term  success  and  devotes  significant  effort  to  the
       investigation of  new locations  utilizing a  variety of  sophisticated
       analytical  techniques.    The  site  selection  process focuses  on  a
       variety  of  factors including:    trading-area  demographics  such  as
       target population  density and household  income levels; an  evaluation
       of site characteristics  such as visibility, accessibility and  traffic
       volume;  proximity  to   activity  centers  such  as  shopping   malls,
       hotel/motel complexes  and offices;  and an  analysis of  the potential
       competition.   Members of  senior management  inspect and  approve each
       restaurant site prior to its acquisition.

       The Company  periodically reevaluates restaurant  sites to ensure  that
       site  selection   attributes  have  not   deteriorated  below   minimum
       standards.  In the event site deterioration were to  occur, the Company
       makes a  concerted effort  to improve the  restaurant's performance  by
       providing  physical,  operating and  marketing  enhancements  unique to
       each restaurant's  situation.    If  internal efforts  to  restore  the
       restaurant's   performance   to  acceptable   minimum   standards   are
       unsuccessful, the  Company considers  relocation to  a proximate,  more
       desirable  site, or  evaluates closing the restaurant  if the Company's
       criteria,  such as return  on investment  and area  demographic data do
       not support  a relocation.   Since  inception, the  Company has  closed
       only three  restaurants, including one  in fiscal  1993 and two  in the
       second  quarter  of  fiscal  1994,  which  were  performing  below  the
       Company's   standards   primarily   due   to   declining   trading-area
       demographics.  These  and future closings will  be key to a  successful
       reallocation of resources to the stronger performing stores.

       The  following  table illustrates  the  system-wide  restaurants either
       opened or acquired  in fiscal 1994 and  the planned openings in  fiscal
       1995:

       The restaurants acquired by the Company  in fiscal 1994 relate to three
       acquisitions.   In October 1993, the  Company acquired the  assets of a
       franchisee,  which  operated four  Chili's restaurants  in Pennsylvania
       and Ohio  for approximately $8,165,000.00  in cash.   In May 1994,  the
       Company acquired 100% ownership interest in  On The Border in  exchange
       for  1,239,130  shares  of  Company  common   stock.    On  The  Border
       operations included 14  company-operated and 7 franchised On The Border
       restaurants in Texas, Florida, Tennessee,  Colorado and Missouri.  Also
       in  May  1994, the  Company  acquired  the  remaining  50% interest  in
       Northwest Restaurants  Joint Venture  ("NRJV") from  its joint  venture
       partner in  exchange for 256,576 shares  of Company common stock.  NRJV
       operated nine Chili's restaurants in California and Nevada.

       The  Company  anticipates  that  some  of  the  fiscal  1995  projected
       restaurant  openings will  be constructed  pursuant to  "build-to-suit"
       agreements,  in which the lessor  contributes the land cost and all, or
       substantially  all, of  the  building  construction  costs.   In  other
       cases, the Company either leases  the land, and pays  for the building,
       furniture,  fixtures and  equipment from  its  own  funds, or  owns the
       land,  building, furniture,  fixtures  and equipment.    The  Company's
       restaurant concept  portfolio allows the  Company to purchase  multiple
       site  locations, which offers  the Company  a competitive  advantage in
       the real estate market.

       As  of June 29,  1994, the  Company has  completed obtaining  sites for
       fiscal 1995  projected openings and  has lease  or purchase commitments
       for future construction  of 44 Chili's, 12 Grady's, 17 Macaroni  Grill,
       6 Spageddies  and 2  On The  Border restaurant  sites.  The  Company is
       currently in  the process of locating  sites for  fiscal 1996 projected
       openings.

</TABLE>

       The specific rate at  which the Company is able to open new restaurants
       is  determined   by  its  success   in  locating  satisfactory   sites,
       negotiating  acceptable lease  or purchase  terms, securing appropriate
       local governmental  permits  and  approvals,  and by  its  capacity  to
       supervise construction and recruit and train management personnel.

       Joint Venture and Franchise Operations

       The Company intends  to continue  its expansion  through joint  venture
       and  franchise  development,  both  domestically  and  internationally.
       During the year ended  June 29, 1994, 14  new Chili's and one  Macaroni
       Grill franchised restaurants were opened.

       During  the  past   two  years,  the   Company  entered   into  several
       international  franchise   agreements,  which  will  bring  Chili's  to
       Australia, France, Puerto  Rico, and the United  Kingdom in the next 12
       months.   In fiscal 1994, the  first Chili's  restaurants outside North
       America  opened in  Singapore  and  Malaysia  on February 4,  1994  and
       June 15,  1994, respectively.   The  third, fourth  and  fifth overseas
       Chili's  locations  opened  in Egypt,  Australia  and  Puerto  Rico  on
       July 19, 1994, August 28, 1994 and September 6, 1994, respectively.

       The Company  intends to continue  pursuing international expansion  and
       is  currently  contemplating  development  in  other  countries.    The
       Company  has  entered  into  a separate  joint  venture  agreement  for
       research  and development activities  related to  the testing  of a new
       restaurant concept and  has a 50% interest in this joint venture, which
       is accounted for under  the equity method.   A typical joint venture or
       franchise  development   agreement   provides  for   payment  of   area
       development  and  initial franchise  fees  in  addition  to  subsequent
       royalty and advertising  fees based on the  annual gross sales of  each
       restaurant.  Future  joint venture or franchise development  agreements
       are  expected  to remain  limited  to  enterprises  having  significant
       experience  as restaurant  operators and  proven financial  ability  to
       develop multi-unit operations.

       At  June 29, 1994,  20  total joint  venture  or  franchise development
       agreements existed.  The Company anticipates  that an additional 25  to
       30 franchised Chili's,  0-2 franchised Macaroni Grill restaurants,  and
       1 franchised Spageddies restaurant will be opened during fiscal 1995.

       Restaurant Management

       The Company's  philosophy to  maintain and  operate each  concept as  a
       distinct and separate entity ensures  that the culture, recruitment and
       training  programs and  unique  operating environments  are  preserved.
       These factors are critical to the viability of each concept.

       The Company's restaurant management  structure varies by  concept.  The
       individual  restaurants  themselves  are  led  by  a  management   team
       including  a General  Manager  and  between three  to  five  additional
       managers.    The  level  of restaurant  supervision  depends  upon  the
       operating  complexity  and sales  volume  of  each  concept.   An  Area
       Director/Supervisor is responsible for the supervision of, on  average,
       three to  seven restaurants.   For  those concepts  with a  significant
       number  of units  within a  geographical region,  additional levels  of
       management may be  provided.  Each concept  is directed by a  President
       or Senior Vice President.

       The  Company believes  that there  is  a  high correlation  between the
       quality  of  restaurant  management  and the  long-term  success  of  a
       concept.   In that regard, the  Company encourages  increased tenure at
       all management positions through various short and long-term  incentive
       programs,  including equity ownership.  These programs,  coupled with a
       general  management  philosophy  emphasizing  quality  of  life,   have
       enabled  the  Company  to attract  and retain  management  employees at
       levels above the industry norm.

       The  Company  ensures consistent  quality  standards  in  all  concepts
       through  the issuance  of Operations  Manuals covering all  elements of
       operations and  Food  &  Beverage Manuals  which provide  guidance  for
       preparation of Company formulated recipes.   Routine visitation  to the
       restaurants by all levels  of supervision enforce  strict adherence  to
       Company standards. 

       The  Director  of  Training   for  each  concept   is  responsible  for
       maintaining  each   concept's  operational   training  program,   which
       includes  a  four   to  five  month  training  period  for   restaurant
       management  trainees,  a continuing  management  training  process  for
       managers and supervisors,  and training  teams consisting of groups  of
       employees  experienced in  all  facets of  restaurant  operations  that
       train employees to open new restaurants.   The training teams typically
       begin on-site training at  a new restaurant seven to ten days prior  to
       opening  and  remain on  location  two  to  three  weeks following  the
       opening to ensure the smooth transition to operating personnel.

       Purchasing

       The  Company's  ability to  maintain  consistent  quality  of  products
       throughout each of its restaurant  concepts depends upon acquiring food
       products and related items from reliable  sources.  Suppliers are  pre-
       approved by the  Company and are required along with the restaurants to
       adhere  to  strict  product  specifications  established  through   the
       Company's newly created quality  assurance program to  ensure that high
       quality, wholesome  food  and  beverage  products  are  served  in  the
       restaurants.  The Company negotiates directly with the major  suppliers
       to  obtain competitive prices and uses purchase commitment contracts to
       stabilize  the potentially  volatile  pricing associated  with  certain
       commodity  items.    All  essential  food  and  beverage  products  are
       available,  or  upon  short   notice  can  be   made  available,   from
       alternative qualified  suppliers in all cities  in which the  Company's
       restaurants are located.  Because of  the relatively rapid turnover  of
       perishable food  products, inventories in  the restaurants,  consisting
       primarily of  food, beverages  and supplies,  have  a modest  aggregate
       dollar value in relation to revenues.

       Advertising and Marketing

       The  Company's concepts generally  focus on  the 18 to 54  year old age
       group,  which  constitutes approximately  half  of  the  United  States
       population.  Members of  this population segment grew up on fast  food,
       but the Company believes that, with  increasing maturity, they prefer a
       more adult, upscale  dining experience. To  attract this  target group,
       the  Company  relies  primarily  on  television,  radio,  direct   mail
       advertising and word-of-mouth information communicated by customers.

       The Company's  franchise agreements  require advertising  contributions
       to the  Company to be used  exclusively for the purpose of maintaining,
       directly  administering  and  preparing  standardized  advertising  and
       promotional activities.  Franchisees spend additional amounts on  local
       advertising when approved by the Company.

       Competition

       The restaurant business  is highly  competitive with respect to  price,
       service, restaurant  location and food  quality, and  is often affected
       by  changes in  consumer tastes,  economic conditions,  population  and
       traffic  patterns.    The Company  competes  within  each  market  with
       locally-owned restaurants as  well as national and regional  restaurant
       chains,  some  of  which  operate  more  restaurants  and have  greater
       financial resources  and longer operating  histories than the  Company.
       There  is   active  competition  for   management  personnel  and   for
       attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants.

       Employees

       At June  29, 1994, the Company  employed approximately 38,000  persons,
       of  whom  approximately  650  were  corporate  personnel,  1,300   were
       restaurant  managers   or  trainees   and  36,050   were  employed   in
       non-management restaurant positions.  Of the   650 corporate employees,
       250 were  in management  positions and approximately  400 were  general
       office employees.    The executive  officers  of  the Company  have  an
       average  of  more  than  19  years  of  experience  in  the  restaurant
       industry.

       The Company  considers its employee relations  to be  good and believes
       that  its employee turnover  rate is  lower than  the industry average.
       Most  employees,  other  than   restaurant  management  and   corporate
       personnel, are paid on  an hourly basis.  The Company believes that  it
       provides  working conditions  and  wages that  compare  favorably  with
       those of  its competition.  The  Company's employees are not covered by
       any collective bargaining agreements.

       Service Marks

       The   Company   has    registered,   among   other   marks,    "Brinker
       International",   "Chili's",  "Grady's",   "Romano's  Macaroni  Grill",
       "Spageddies", "Spageddies  Italian Italian Food",  and "On The  Border"
       as service  marks with the United  States Patent  and Trademark Office.
       In  addition, the Company  has a  service mark  application pending for
       "Grady's American Grill" and "Spageddies Italian Kitchen".

       Seasonality

       The Company's  sales volumes  fluctuate seasonally,  and are  generally
       higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months.

       Governmental Regulation

       Each  of  the  Company's  restaurants   is  subject  to  licensing  and
       regulation  by alcoholic  beverage control,  health, sanitation, safety
       and  fire  agencies in  the  state  and/or  municipality  in which  the
       restaurant  is   located.     The  Company  has  not   encountered  any
       difficulties  or  failures  in  obtaining  the  required  licenses   or
       approvals that could delay  or prevent the opening of a new  restaurant
       and does not, at this time, anticipate any.

       The Company is  subject to federal and state environmental regulations,
       but these have  not had  a material  negative effect  on the  Company's
       operations.  More stringent and varied  requirements of local and state
       governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and  environmental
       factors  could  delay  or prevent  development  of  new restaurants  in
       particular  locations.   The  Company  is  subject  to  the Fair  Labor
       Standards  Act which governs  such matters  as minimum  wages, overtime
       and   other  working   conditions,  along   with  the   American   With
       Disabilities  Act  and various  family  leave  mandates.   The  Company
       anticipates legislation concerning mandated  health care benefits which
       may have significant consequences to the Company.

Item 2.     PROPERTIES.

       The  following  table   illustrates  the  approximate   average  dining
       capacity for each unit in primary restaurant concepts:

</TABLE>

       Certain of the Company's restaurants are leased  for an initial term of
       5  to 30  years, with  renewal terms  of  1  to 30  years.   The leases
       typically provide for a fixed rental  plus percentage rentals based  on
       sales volume.   At  June 29,  1994, the  Company owned the  land and/or
       building for 236 of the 366  Company-operated restaurants.  The Company
       has closed three  restaurants since  inception and  considers that  its
       properties are suitable,  adequate, well-maintained and sufficient  for
       the operations contemplated.

       The  Company  leases warehouse  space  totalling  approximately  31,500
       square feet  in  Dallas, Texas,  which  it  uses for  menu  development
       activity and  for  storage of  equipment  and  supplies.   The  Company
       purchased an  office building  containing approximately  105,000 square
       feet for its corporate headquarters in  July 1989.  Approximately 5,600
       square feet of  this building is  leased to  third party  tenants.   In
       March  1992,  the  Company  leased  additional  office  space  for  the
       expansion of its corporate headquarters.  This additional office  lease
       was expanded  in July 1994  and currently includes approximately 46,400
       square feet of office space.

       The Company's  Common Stock is  traded on the  New York Stock  Exchange
       ("NYSE")  under   the  symbol  "EAT".    Bid  prices  quoted  represent
       interdealer  prices  without  adjustment  for retail  markup,  markdown
       and/or   commissions,  and   may  not   necessarily  represent   actual
       transactions.   The following table sets  forth the  quarterly high and
       low closing sales prices of the Common Stock, as reported by the NYSE.

       Fiscal year ended June 29, 1994:

       First Quarter          26 1/12           22 1/6

       Fourth Quarter         24 2/3            18 1/3

       On March 9,  1994, the Company declared a stock split,  effected in the
       form of  a 50%  stock dividend  ("Stock Dividend")  to shareholders  of
       record on  March 21, 1994, payable March 30, 1994.  Stock prices in the
       preceding table have been restated to reflect the Stock Dividend.

       As of  September 9,  1994, there  were 2,107  holders of record  of the
       Company's Common Stock.

       The Company has never  paid cash dividends on its Common Stock and does
       not  currently  intend to  do so  as  profits  are reinvested  into the
       Company  to fund  expansion of  its  restaurant  business.   Payment of
       dividends  in  the  future  will  depend  upon  the  Company's  growth,
       profitability, financial  condition and other  factors which the  Board
       of Directors may deem relevant.

1993, and the related consolidated  statements of income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows  for each of the years in the  three-year period ended June 29,

consolidated financial statements  and our report thereon are  incorporated by
reference in the annual report on Form  10-K for the year ended June 29, 1994.
In connection  with our  audits of  the aforementioned  consolidated financial

REVENUES

Increases in  revenues of 26% and  24% in fiscal 1994  and 1993, respectively,
primarily relate to the  increases in the number of  Company-owned restaurants
and comparable store sales.  The  percentage increase in the average number of
Company-owned restaurants in operation was 20% for both fiscal 1994 and  1993.
Increases  in comparable  store sales were  2.1% and  3.8% in  fiscal 1994 and
1993, respectively.   These favorable  trends were due  to increased  customer
counts resulting from the  Company's commitment to providing quality  food and
service at  an exceptional value, its  ongoing evolution of the  menu, and its
continued  remodeling program to keep its restaurants updated and the ambiance
inviting to the guests.  In addition, the Company continues to refine its real
estate  site selection  process  which focuses  on trading-area  demographics,
visibility, accessibility, and complementary concept locations.  Quality sites
provide  a  competitive advantage  and contribute  to  stronger sales  for new
restaurants.   Menu  price increases  had  little impact  on  the increase  in
revenues as  weighted average price increases over the past two years averaged
less than 1% per year.

COSTS AND EXPENSES (as a percent of Revenues)

Cost of sales  decreased in fiscal  1994 compared to  fiscal 1993.   Favorable
price changes in  produce, dairy,  poultry, and pasta,  recipe changes  toward
lower  food  cost items,  implementation of  meat  waste control  systems, and
increased  purchasing  leverage  offset  unfavorable  price  changes  in  non-
alcoholic beverages.  Cost of sales remained constant in  fiscal 1993 compared
to  fiscal  1992  as the  favorable  impact from  continued  emphasis  on food
portioning and  waste and yield management programs were offset by product mix
changes to menu items with higher percentage food costs. 

Restaurant expenses  were flat in fiscal  1994.  Insurance costs  were flat as
aggressive safety and loss management  programs implemented in the restaurants
in fiscal 1993 have continued to be successful and offset rising insurance and
health care costs.  Occupancy costs, however, decreased due to  an increase in
percentage  of restaurants owned versus  leased.  Liquor  taxes also decreased
due to the Company's expansion into states with lower liquor tax rates.  These
decreases were  offset by increases  in manager salaries  due to  annual merit
increases, manager training expenses to support expansion, and  property taxes
due to increased rates.   In fiscal 1993, restaurant expenses declined  as the
administrative hours required  of restaurant managers was reduced, programs to
contain insurance costs were introduced, and rent expense decreased due to the
increase in percentage of owned restaurants versus leased.

Depreciation  and amortization increased in fiscal 1994 and 1993 primarily due
to continued investments in computer hardware and software which has generated
operating efficiencies at  both the restaurants  and corporate office  support
groups.   Also,  the  ongoing  restaurant remodeling  program,  the  continued
replacement of restaurant furniture  and equipment, and the trend  to purchase
new restaurant sites in favor of leasing have contributed to the increases.   

General  and administrative  expenses have  decreased in  the past  two fiscal
years   as  a  result  of   the  Company's  focus   on  controlling  corporate
expenditures.   Efficiencies resulting  from investments in  computer hardware
and software allowed the Company to continue with the aggressive  expansion of
its restaurant concepts without  incurring significant increases in  staff and
support costs.

Merger expenses are  one-time charges  related to  the acquisition  of On  The
Border, such as consulting fees, legal fees, and severance costs.

Lawsuit  settlement represents  a one-time  charge to  settle an  injury claim
arising from an airplane  accident involving several former officers of On The
Border.

Other, net,  decreased in  fiscal 1994.   A gain  of approximately  $1 million
related to the sale of land in fiscal 1994 was offset by losses resulting from
recognition of a  permanent decline  in market value  for certain  securities.
Net realized gains  on investment  transactions were down  slightly in  fiscal
1994.   Dividend  and interest  income, however,  was flat.   The  increase in
fiscal 1993 compared to fiscal 1992 is the result of  increased realized gains
from investment transactions experienced  in fiscal 1993 offset somewhat  by a
decrease in dividend and interest income.

INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

As a result  of changes in  the relationships between  revenues and costs  and
expenses, income before provision for income  taxes has increased at rates  of
22.3% and 42.2% in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

The  Company's effective income tax rate of  35.4%, 34.7%, and 34.3% in fiscal
1994,  1993, and  1992, respectively,  continues to  increase as  a  result of
incremental  earnings taxed  at higher  effective  rates and  additional state
income  tax liabilities  resulting  from expansion,  particularly relating  to
growth in Florida and California.

The  Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation  Act,  enacted  in August  1993,  mandated
certain changes in Federal income tax  laws, which among other items, included
an  increase in the  statutory Federal corporate  income tax rate  from 34% to
35%,  retroactive  to January  1993, reinstatement  of  the targeted  jobs tax
credit, retroactive to January 1993, and a  tax credit for FICA taxes paid  on
tips, effective January 1994.  These changes did not have a material impact on
Brinker's  fiscal 1994 and 1993 effective income  tax rate or the consolidated
financial statements.

NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE

Net income and primary net income per share as a percent of revenues decreased
slightly in  fiscal 1994 as a  result of one-time charges,  including the $2.2
million  lawsuit settlement and $1.9  million of costs  incurred in connection
with the On  The Border acquisition.   Net income and  primary net income  per
share  increased  as a  percent of  revenues  in fiscal  1993 as  a  result of
controlling  costs and  expenses while  continuing with  the expansion  of the
restaurant  concepts.  The increases in the  weighted average number of common
shares outstanding arose from common stock options exercised each year.

STOCK DIVIDENDS

Stock splits in each of March 1994,  May 1993, and November 1991, effected  in
the  form of 50%  stock dividends, resulted  in the issuance  of 23.2 million,
22.8 million, and 21.5 million shares of the Company's common stock, in fiscal
1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

The Company has not  experienced a significant overall impact  from inflation.
As  operating expenses  increase,  the Company,  to  the extent  permitted  by
competition, recovers increased costs by increasing menu prices.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The working capital  deficit increased from $40.6 million  at June 30, 1993 to
$56.2  million at  June 29,  1994.   Strong  operating  results from  new  and
existing  units  and the  exercise of  employee  stock options  generated cash
proceeds  that were  offset  by the  Company's  capital expenditures  and  the
investment of available  cash in  long-term marketable securities.   Net  cash
provided  by operating activities increased  to $125.5 million  in fiscal 1994
from $106.2 million in fiscal 1993 due to the increased  number of restaurants
in  operation, strong operating results from existing units, and the effective
containment of costs.

The Company had available funds from credit facilities totalling $41.2 million
at June 29, 1994.  The Company estimates that its capital expenditures  during
fiscal  1995 will approximate $200 million.  These capital expenditures, which
will primarily relate to  the planned expansion of each restaurant concept and
the  Company's  ongoing   remodel  program,  will  be  funded   from  internal
operations,  income earned  from  investments, build-to-suit  lease agreements
with landlords, and draw downs on the Company's available lines of credit.

The Clinton administration  continues to analyze  and propose new  legislation
which could adversely impact  the entire business community.   Mandated health
care  and minimum  wage  measures, if  passed,  could increase  the  Company's
operating costs.  The Company would attempt to offset  increased costs through
continued improvements in operating efficiencies and menu price increases.

The Company is not  aware of any other event or  trend which would potentially
affect its liquidity.   In the event such  a trend would develop,  the Company
believes that there are sufficient  funds available under the lines of  credit
and from strong internal cash generating capabilities to adequately manage the
expansion of the business.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In  November 1992, the  Financial Accounting  Standards Board  ("FASB") issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting   Standards  No. 112  ("SFAS   No. 112"),
Employers' Accounting  for Postemployment Benefits.   SFAS No. 112  sets forth
standards of accounting and reporting for employers  that offer postemployment
benefits.   SFAS No. 112 is  effective for  the Company in  fiscal 1995.   The
Company does  not believe the  adoption of SFAS  No. 112 will have  a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.

                          Brinker International, Inc.
                  Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      (a)   Basis of Presentation

      The consolidated  financial statements  include the accounts  of Brinker
      International, Inc. and its  wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Brinker").  All
      significant intercompany accounts and transactions have  been eliminated
      in consolidation.  

      On March 9, 1994,  Brinker declared a stock  split in the form of  a 50%
      stock dividend to shareholders  of record on March 21, 1994,  payable on
      March 30, 1994.   As a result, 23.2 million shares  of common stock were
      issued, and  cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares.  All references
      to the number of shares and per share amounts of  common stock have been
      restated  to  reflect  this  stock  dividend.    In addition,  Brinker's
      consolidated financial  statements and notes thereto  have been restated
      to include the accounts and operations of On The Border Cafes, Inc. ("On
      The Border")  and Northwest Restaurants  Joint Venture ("NRJV")  for all
      periods presented (see Note 2).

      Effective July 1, 1993, Brinker adopted a 52 week fiscal year ending  on
      the last Wednesday  in June.   Most retailing  and restaurant  companies
      operate on an accounting calendar that is measured in weeks rather  than
      months.  Thus, a normal fiscal year only contains 364 days.  Every fifth
      or sixth year, lost days are recaptured by having a 53 week fiscal year.
      This change enhances Brinker's  ability to measure comparative operating
      results.  The  impact of this change was not  significant.  Fiscal years
      1994,  1993, and 1992 ended  June 29, 1994, June 30,  1993, and June 30,
      1992, respectively.

      Certain  amounts in  the fiscal  1993 consolidated  financial statements
      have been reclassified to conform with the fiscal 1994 presentation.

      (b)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

      Brinker's policy is to  invest cash in excess of  operating requirements
      in  income-producing investments.    Cash invested  in instruments  with
      maturities  of  three  months  or less  at  the  time  of  investment is
      reflected  as  cash  equivalents.   Cash  equivalents  of  $110,000  and
      $11,142,000 at  June 29, 1994  and June 30, 1993,  respectively, consist
      primarily  of  money  market  funds,  short-term  municipal  funds,  and
      commercial paper.   The carrying value of these instruments approximates
      market value due to their short-term maturities.

      (c)   Inventories

      Inventories, which consist  of food, beverages, and supplies, are stated
      at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.

      (d)   Property and Equipment

      Buildings   and  leasehold   improvements   are  amortized   using   the
      straight-line method over the lesser of the life of the lease, including
      renewal  options, or  the estimated  useful lives  of the  assets, which
      range from 5 to 20 years.

      Furniture and  equipment are depreciated using  the straight-line method
      over the estimated useful lives of the  assets, which range from 3 to  8
      years.

      (e)   Capitalized Interest

      Interest costs capitalized during the construction period of restaurants
      were approximately  $690,000,  $800,000, and  $1,300,000  during  fiscal
      1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

      (f)   Preopening Costs

      Capitalized preopening  costs include  the direct and  incremental costs
      typically  associated  with  the  opening  of  a  new  restaurant  which
      primarily consist of costs incurred to develop new restaurant management
      teams,  travel  and  lodging for  both  the  training  and opening  unit
      management teams, and the food, beverage, and supplies costs incurred to
      perform  role  play testing  of  all  equipment,  concept  systems,  and
      recipes.   Effective  July 1,  1993, Brinker  prospectively revised  its
      policy for capitalizing and  amortizing preopening costs associated with
      the  opening of  new  restaurant sites.    The amortization  period  was
      reduced from  24  months to  12 months.   The  impact of  the change  in
      accounting  policy  did   not  have  a  material   impact  on  Brinker's
      consolidated financial statements.

      (g)   Stock Options

      Proceeds from the exercise  of common stock options issued  to officers,
      directors,  key employees,  and  certain non-employees  under  Brinker's
      stock option plans  are credited to  common stock to  the extent of  par
      value and to additional paid-in capital for the excess.

      (h)   Net Income Per Share

      Both  primary and fully  diluted net income  per share are  based on the
      weighted average  number of  shares outstanding  during the fiscal  year
      increased by  common equivalent shares (stock  options) determined using
      the treasury stock method.   Primary weighted average equivalent  shares
      are  determined based on the average market price exceeding the exercise
      price of the stock  options.  Fully diluted weighted  average equivalent
      shares  are  determined based  on the  higher of  the average  or ending
      market price exceeding the exercise price of the stock options.

2.    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

      On June 30, 1993,  Brinker acquired  the remaining 50%  interest in  its
      three unit  Spageddies Italian Kitchen restaurant concept ("Spageddies")
      from  its  joint  venture partner  in  exchange  for  205,716 shares  of
      Brinker's  common stock.  The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling
      of  interests, and  accordingly,  Brinker's 1993  consolidated financial
      statements include the accounts  and operations of Spageddies  since the
      commencement of its operations in July 1992.

      On October 7, 1993, Brinker  acquired the assets of a  franchisee, which
      operated  four  Chili's  restaurants   in  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio,  for
      approximately  $8,165,000 in cash.  The acquisition was accounted for as
      a  purchase.   Goodwill  of approximately  $6,941,000, representing  the
      excess of cost over the fair  value of the assets acquired, was recorded
      in  connection with  the acquisition  and is  included in  other assets.
      Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 30 years.  The
      operations  of the  restaurants are  included in  Brinker's consolidated
      results of  operations from  the date  of acquisition.   The  results of
      operations on a  pro forma  basis are  not presented  separately as  the
      results  do not  differ significantly  from historical  amounts reported
      herein.

      On  May 18, 1994,  Brinker consummated  a merger  agreement with  On The
      Border,  pursuant to which Brinker acquired a 100% ownership interest in
      On The Border.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, 3,767,711 fully
      diluted shares of On The Border common stock were converted to 1,239,130
      shares of Brinker common  stock (approximately 0.3 for 1  exchange).  On
      The  Border's operations  included fourteen  company-operated and  seven
      franchised casual  dining Tex-Mex  theme restaurants.   This acquisition
      was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

      On May 25, 1994,  Brinker acquired  the remaining 50%  interest in  NRJV
      from its joint venture partner in exchange for 256,576 shares of Brinker
      common  stock.   NRJV  owned and  operated  nine Chili's  restaurants in
      California and Nevada.  This acquisition  was accounted for as a pooling
      of interests.

      Revenues,  net income (loss), primary  net income (loss)  per share, and
      fully diluted net  income (loss) per share  for the period  ended May 4,
      1994, fiscal 1993,  and fiscal 1992 are presented below  for Brinker, On
      The Border, and  NRJV on a  separate and  combined basis (in  thousands,

      (1)   On  The Border  amounts  are based  on  financial results  through
            April 25, 1994.

      Pro  forma  adjustments  represent  the  elimination  of  royalty  fees,
      franchise fees,  development fees, accounting fees,  and management fees
      charged  to NRJV by Brinker, and the elimination of Brinker's investment
      in  NRJV including  partnership  distributions and  equity  income.   In
      addition, a pro forma adjustment was made in fiscal 1994 to reinstate an
      On The  Border deferred  income  tax asset  of approximately  $1,024,000
      which was  not recognized on an  On The Border stand-alone  basis due to
      the uncertainty of On The Border's  ability to utilize the asset against
      future earnings.

      Merger expenses of  $1,949,000 incurred  in fiscal 1994  related to  the
      acquisition  of On  The Border  are reported  separately to  reflect the
      impact  of  nonrecurring  charges.   These  costs  primarily  relate  to
      consulting fees, legal fees, and severance costs.

3.    INVESTMENTS

      Brinker  adopted Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards  No. 115
      ("SFAS No. 115"), Accounting for Certain Investments  in Debt and Equity
      Securities,  effective June 29,  1994.   Under  SFAS  No. 115, debt  and
      equity  securities   are  classified  into  three  categories:  trading,
      available-for-sale,  and held-to-maturity.  Trading securities represent
      debt and equity securities held for  a very short period with the intent
      on  making a  profit  on the  difference  between retail  versus  dealer
      prices.   Held-to-maturity securities  represent debt securities  that a
      company has the intent and ability to hold to  maturity.  Available-for-
      sale securities represent  debt and  equity securities that  can not  be
      classified as trading or held-to-maturity.

      As of June 29, 1994, Brinker's investment portfolio consists entirely of
      equity  securities  classified  as  available-for-sale.    SFAS  No. 115
      requires available-for-sale securities to be  carried at fair value with
      unrealized gains and unrealized losses reported as  a separate component
      of shareholders' equity.   A decline in  market value of  any available-
      for-sale  security below  cost that  is deemed  other than  temporary is
      charged to earnings resulting  in the establishment of a new  cost basis
      for the security.

      Brinker's investment position at  June 29, 1994 and June 30, 1993  is as
      follows (in thousands):

                                                  1994           1993

      Cost                                      $45,680        $28,693
      Gross unrealized holding gains                 66            917
      Gross unrealized holding losses              (507)           (34)
           Fair value                           $45,239        $29,576

      Realized  gains  and  realized  losses  are  determined  on  a  specific
      identification  basis.     Realized  gains  and   realized  losses  from
      investment  transactions  were  $1,871,000  and   $1,400,000  (including
      $1,072,000 of realized losses resulting from recognition of a  permanent
      decline in  market value  for certain  securities)  during fiscal  1994,
      $2,137,000 and  $558,000 during fiscal  1993, and $965,000  and $950,000
      during  fiscal 1992.  Dividend  and interest income  during fiscal 1994,
      1993, and 1992 was $3,624,000, $2,800,000, and $3,200,000, respectively.
      Realized  gains and  realized losses  as well  as dividend  and interest
      income are included in other, net.

                                          $57,878        $45,960

5.    CREDIT FACILITIES

      Brinker  has available  credit facilities  aggregating $41.2  million at
      June 29, 1994.   These credit  facilities bear interest  based upon  the
      lower  of  the  banks'  "Base"  or prime  rate  plus  1%,  CD  rates, or
      Eurodollar  rates,  and expire  through  fiscal 1995.    Commitment fees
      related to these credit facilities were not material.

6.    SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES

      Prior to its acquisition by Brinker, On The Border completed the private
      placement of  $1,200,000 of senior  subordinated convertible  debentures
      ("debentures")  on March 10, 1992.  The debentures bear interest at 8.5%
      per annum and are  payable semi-annually.  If not  previously converted,
      Brinker will  be required  to redeem $300,000  of debentures on  each of
      January 15, 1996, 1997, 1998, and December 31, 1998.  The debentures may
      be converted into Brinker common stock at a rate of $24.32 per share  by
      the holders at any time and may be prepaid at the election of Brinker.

7.    INCOME TAXES

      Brinker  adopted  Statement  of  Financial Accounting  Standards  No. 96
      ("SFAS No. 96"), "Accounting  for Income  Taxes", in fiscal  1988.   The
      Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of  Financial
      Accounting Standards  No. 109 ("SFAS  No. 109"), "Accounting  for Income
      Taxes", in February 1992.   SFAS No. 109, which supersedes  SFAS No. 96,
      retained the asset and  liability approach for financial  accounting and
      reporting for income taxes as in SFAS No. 96, but reduced the complexity
      of  SFAS No. 96 and changed the criteria for recognition and measurement
      of  deferred tax assets.   Effective July 1, 1993,  Brinker adopted SFAS
      No. 109 without restatement of prior periods and the impact on Brinker's
      consolidated financial statements was not material.

      The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):

                                                1994         1993       1992

      The  income tax  effects  of temporary  differences  that give  rise  to
      significant  portions of  deferred  income tax  (assets) liabilities  as
      determined under SFAS  No. 96 as  of June 30,  1993 are  as follows  (in
      thousands):

       Depreciation and capitalized interest
         on property and equipment                  $13,269
       Insurance reserves                            (6,948)

      At June 29, 1994, Brinker has available net operating loss carryforwards
      for Federal income tax purposes  of $5,981,000 (arising from the  On The
      Border merger),  which are  available to  offset future  Federal taxable
      income through fiscal 2008.

      The  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, enacted in August 1993, mandated
      certain changes in  Federal income  tax laws, which  among other  items,
      included  an increase in the statutory Federal corporate income tax rate
      from  34%  to 35%,  retroactive to  January  1993, reinstatement  of the
      targeted jobs tax credit, retroactive to January 1993, and a  tax credit
      for FICA taxes paid on tips,  effective January 1994.  These changes did
      not have a  material impact on Brinker's fiscal  1994 and 1993 effective
      income tax rate or the consolidated financial statements.

9.    LEASES

      (a)   Capital Leases

      Brinker  leases  certain  buildings   under  various  leases  which  are
      classified as capital leases.  The asset value of $7,900,000 at June 29,
      1994 and at June 30,  1993, and the related accumulated  amortization of
      $5,100,000  and   $4,800,000  at   June 29,  1994  and   June 30,  1993,
      respectively, are included in property and equipment.

      (b)   Operating Leases

      Brinker  leases  restaurant  facilities  and  certain   equipment  under
      operating leases having terms  expiring at various dates  through fiscal
      2022.   The restaurant leases have  renewal clauses of 5  to 30 years at
      the option of Brinker and have provisions for contingent rent based upon
      a percentage of gross sales, as defined in the leases.  Rent expense for
      fiscal  1994,   1993,  and   1992  was  $31,700,000,   $27,400,000,  and
      $24,900,000, respectively.  Contingent rent included in rent expense for
      fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992 was $2,800,000, $2,500,000, and  $1,900,000,
      respectively.

      (c)   Commitments

      At June 29, 1994, future minimum lease payments on capital and operating
      leases were as follows (in thousands):

            Fiscal Year                      Capital Leases   Operating Leases

            1995                                $  965           $ 26,724
            1996                                   955             26,577
            1997                                   949             26,390
            1998                                   771             25,938
            1999                                   657             25,355
            Thereafter                           2,881            186,927

              Total minimum lease payments       7,178           $317,911
              Imputed interest
                (average rate of 11.5%)          2,213

              Present value of
                minimum payments                 4,965
              Less current installments            501
              Capital lease obligations         $4,464

      In  July  1993, Brinker  entered  into operating  lease  agreements with
      unaffiliated groups  to begin leasing  certain restaurant sites.   These
      unaffiliated groups have  committed to make available  up to $30,000,000
      for the development of  restaurants to be leased by Brinker  for up to 5
      years.  The  agreements with these groups expire in  fiscal 1998, and do
      not provide for renewal.   Upon expiration, Brinker may  either purchase
      the properties  or  allow  the lessor  to  sell the  restaurants  to  an
      unrelated  party  and  guarantee  the residual  value  of  approximately
      $25,500,000.  At June 29, 1994,  $12,400,000 of this financing  facility
      had been utilized.

      At  June 29, 1994, Brinker had  entered into other  lease agreements for
      restaurant  facilities  currently  under   construction  or  yet  to  be
      constructed.    In addition  to a  base  rent, the  leases  also contain
      provisions for  additional contingent  rent based upon  gross sales,  as
      defined  in the leases.   Classification of  these leases  as capital or
      operating  has  not  been  determined  as  construction  of  the  leased
      properties has not been completed.

10.   SAVINGS PLANS

      Effective  January 1,  1993,  Brinker established  the  Brinker  Savings
      Plan I  ("Plan I"), a  qualified  defined contribution  retirement  plan
      covering salaried employees who  have completed one year or  1,000 hours
      of service.  Plan I allows eligible employees to defer receipt  of up to
      20%  of  their  compensation  and contribute  such  amounts  to  various
      investment funds.    Brinker matches  25% of  the first  5% an  employee
      contributes  with Brinker  common  stock.   Employee contributions  vest
      immediately while  Brinker contributions vest 25%  annually beginning in
      the participants' second year  of eligibility since plan inception.   In
      fiscal  1994  and  1993,   Brinker  contributed  approximately  $345,000
      (representing  11,666  shares  of  Brinker common  stock)  and  $173,000
      (representing 8,162  shares of Brinker common  stock), respectively, and
      incurred  approximately  $116,000  and $48,000  in  administrative fees,
      respectively.

      Effective  January 1,  1993,  Brinker  established  the  Brinker Savings
      Plan II  ("Plan II"), a  non-qualified  defined contribution  retirement
      plan  covering highly  compensated employees,  as defined  in the  plan.
      Plan II allows eligible employees to defer receipt of up to 20% of their
      base compensation and  100% of their eligible bonuses, as defined in the
      plan,  and contribute such amounts to various investment funds.  Brinker
      matches  25%  of the  first 5%  a  non-officer contributes  with Brinker
      common  stock while officers' contributions are matched at the same rate
      with  cash.    Employee  contributions vest  immediately  while  Brinker
      contributions vest  25% annually  beginning in the  participants' second
      year  of employment  since plan  inception.   In fiscal  1994  and 1993,
      Brinker  contributed  approximately  $231,000  (of  which  approximately
      $175,000 was used to purchase 7,096 shares of  Brinker common stock) and
      $69,000  (of which  approximately  $49,000 was  used  to purchase  2,373
      shares   of   Brinker   common   stock),   respectively,   and  incurred
      approximately $116,000 and $48,000 in administrative fees, respectively.
      Brinker has a  Rabbi Trust to fund Plan II obligations.   As of June 29,
      1994  and June 30, 1993,  assets of  the trust  aggregated approximately
      $2,599,000 and $566,000, respectively, and are included in other assets.
      The aggregate market value of these assets at June 29, 1994 and June 30,
      1993 approximated aggregate cost.

11.   LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT AND CONTINGENCIES

      On  March 13, 1993, certain officers of On The Border and various family
      members  were involved  in an  airplane accident.   In fiscal  1994, the
      claim was settled  for approximately  $2,248,000 and On  The Border  was
      released from further liability.

      Brinker  is  engaged  in  various  legal  proceedings  and  has  certain
      unresolved  claims pending.   The  ultimate liability,  if any,  for the
      aggregate amounts claimed cannot  be determined at this time.   However,
      management of Brinker, based upon consultation with legal counsel, is of
      the opinion that there are  not matters pending or threatened which  are
      expected to  have a  material adverse  effect on  Brinker's consolidated
      financial condition or results of operations.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Board of Directors
Brinker International, Inc.:


We  have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets  of  Brinker
International, Inc. and subsidiaries  ("the Company") as of June 29,  1994 and
June 30,   1993,  and   the   related  consolidated   statements  of   income,
shareholders' equity, and  cash flows for each of the  years in the three-year
period ended June 29, 1994.   These consolidated financial statements  are the
responsibility  of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.   Those standards  require that  we plan and  perform the  audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates made by the Company's management, as well as  evaluating the overall
financial  statement presentation.    We believe  that  our audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion, the  consolidated  financial  statements referred  to  above
present  fairly, in all material  respects, the financial  position of Brinker
International,  Inc. and subsidiaries as  of June 29, 1994  and June 30, 1993,
and the results of  their operations and cash flows  for each of the  years in
the  three-year  period ended  June 29,  1994,  in conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles.

Committees of the Board of Directors

      The  Board  of Directors  of the  Company  has established  an Executive
Committee, Audit Committee,  Compensation Committee and  Nominating Committee.
The  Executive  Committee  (along  with  Ms. Smithart,  comprised  of  Messrs.
Brinker, McDougall, Ford, Cardwell and Staubach) has authority  to act for the
Board on most matters during the intervals between Board meetings.

      All  of the  members  of  the  Audit  and  Compensation  Committees  are
directors independent of  management who are not and never  have been officers
or employees  of the Company.   The Audit Committee is  currently comprised of
Ms. Evans  and Messrs. Haggar and Regas and  the Committee met once during the
fiscal year.  Included  among the functions  performed by the Audit  Committee
are:  the review with independent  auditors of the scope  of the audit and the
results of the  annual audit  by the independent  auditors; consideration  and
recommendation to the  Board of the selection of the  independent auditors for
the next year; the review with  management and the independent auditors of the
annual financial  statements of the Company;  and the review of  the scope and
adequacy of internal audit activities.

      The Compensation  Committee  is currently  comprised  of  Messrs. Evans,
Hunt, Harris and Staubach  and it met three (3) times  during the fiscal year.
Functions  performed  by  the  Compensation Committee  include:  ensuring  the
effectiveness  of senior  management and  management continuity,  ensuring the
reasonableness   and   appropriateness  of   senior   management  compensation
arrangements and  levels, the adoption, amendment and administration of stock-
based  incentive  plans  (subject  to shareholder  approval  where  required),
management  of the various stock option plans  of the Company, approval of the
total number  of available shares to  be used each year  in stock-based plans,
approval of the adoption  and amendment of significant compensation  plans and
approval of all compensation  actions for officers, particularly at  and above
the level of executive vice president.  The specific nature of the Committee's
responsibilities as it relates to executive officers are set forth below under
"Report of the Compensation Committee."

      The purpose of the  Nominating Committee, created in September  1993, is
to  recommend to the  Board of Directors potential  non-employee members to be
added as new or replacement members to the Board of Directors.  The Nominating
Committee  met once during the fiscal year and is composed of Messrs. Brinker,
Evans, Hunt, McDougall and Staubach and Ms. Smithart and Ms. Evans.

      For  purposes  of determining  whether  non-employee  directors will  be
nominated for reelection to the Board of Directors, the non-employee directors
have been divided into four classes.  Each non-employee director will continue
to  be subject  to reelection by  the shareholders  of the  Company each year.
However, after a non-employee  director has served on  the Board of  Directors
for  four years, such  director shall  be deemed to  have been advised  by the
Nominating  Committee that  he or  she will  not stand  for reelection  at the
subsequent  annual meeting of shareholders and shall be considered a "Retiring
Director".    Notwithstanding  this   policy,  the  Nominating  Committee  may
determine  that it  is appropriate to  renominate any  or all  of the Retiring
Directors  after  first  considering  the appropriateness  of  nominating  new
candidates for election  to the Board of Directors.  The  four classes of non-
employee  directors are as follows:   Messrs. Hunt and  Regas comprise Class 2
and  will  be considered  Retiring  Directors  as  of the  annual  meeting  of
shareholders following  the end of the 1995 fiscal year.  Mr. Haggar comprises
Class 3 and will be considered a Retiring Director as of the annual meeting of
shareholders following  the end of the  1996 fiscal year.   Messrs. Harris and
Staubach comprise Class 4 and will be considered Retiring  Directors as of the
annual  meeting of  shareholders following the  end of  the 1997  fiscal year.
Messrs. Evans, Humphries, and Oesterreicher and Ms. Evans comprise Class 1 and
will be considered Retiring Directors as of the annual meeting of shareholders
following the end of the 1998 fiscal year.

Directors Compensation

      Directors who are not employees  of the Company receive $1,000  for each
meeting of the Board of Directors attended and $1,000 for  each meeting of any
committee of the Board of Directors attended (unless such committee meeting is
held in conjunction with  a meeting of the Board of  Directors, in which event
compensation for  attending the committee meeting will  be $750).  The Company
also  reimburses directors for costs incurred by them in attending meetings of
the Board.

      Directors who are not  employees of the Company receive grants  of stock
options  under the Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
and  Consultants.  Each such  director receives 2,000  stock options annually.
If  the  shareholders of  the Company  approve  the amendment  described under
"Amendment  of Stock  Option  Plans-1991 Stock  Option  Plan for  Non-Employee
Directors and Consultants", new directors who are not employees of the Company
will have  the option at  the beginning  of each Director  term to receive  as
additional  compensation for  serving on  the Board  of Directors  either cash
consideration  of $30,000 per year during the term such non-employee serves as
a director or  a one-time grant  of 12,000 stock  options under the  Company's
1991 Stock  Option Plan for  Non-Employee Directors  and Consultants.   If the
director is appointed to the  Board of Directors at any time other  than at an
annual meeting of  shareholders, such director will make  such election at the
meeting of  the Board of Directors  held contemporaneous with  the next annual
meeting of shareholders and  the director will receive  a prorated portion  of
the  annual cash  compensation for  the period  from the  date of  election or
appointment  to the  Board of  Directors  until the  meeting of  the Board  of
Directors held contemporaneous  with the next annual meeting  of shareholders.
If the director elects to receive cash, the first payment will be made at such
Board of Directors meeting and the following payments will be made on the date
of each  annual meeting of shareholders thereafter.  If the director elects to
receive stock options, they will be granted as of the  60th day following such
meeting (or if  the 60th day is not a business  day, on the first business day
thereafter).  The  stock options will be  granted at the fair  market value on
the date of grant.  One-third of the options  will vest on each of the second,
third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.

      Current directors who are not employees of the Company are also eligible
for additional compensation under this  compensation program.  Commencing with
the meeting of the Board of Directors to be held November 3, 1994, each of the
current non-employee directors  will have  the one-time option  to receive  as
additional compensation for serving  on the Board of Directors  either $30,000
cash  consideration per  year  during the  term  such non-employee  serves  as
director or a  one-time grant of  stock options. The  number of stock  options
received and the vesting period for such options will be prorated as set forth
below.    The  election  of  a  current  director  to  accept  the  additional
compensation  in cash  or in  stock  options will  be  made at  such Board  of
Directors meeting.  If the director  elects to receive cash, the first payment
will  be made at  such Board of  Directors meeting and  the following payments
will be  made on the date  of each annual meeting  of shareholders thereafter.
If a current director elects to receive stock options, they will be granted as
of January 3,  1995.   The stock options  will be granted  at the  fair market
value on the date of grant.

      For  purposes of applying this  new compensation program  to the current
non-employee directors of the Company, if any of Messrs. Evans, Humphries, and
Oesterreicher or Ms. Evans  elect to receive stock options, such director will
be granted 12,000  options on  January 3, 1995, and  one-third of the  options
will be fully  vested on each of January 3,  1997, 1998, and 1999.   If either
Messrs. Harris  or Staubach elect to receive stock options, such director will
be  granted  9,000 stock  options  on January 3,  1995,  and one-third  of the
options will be fully vested  on each of January 3, 1996, 1997, and  1998.  If
Mr. Haggar elects  to receive  stock options, he  will be granted  6,000 stock
options on January 3, 1995, and  one-half of the options will be  fully vested
on each of January 3, 1996 and 1997.  If either of Messrs. Hunt or Regas elect
to receive stock options, he will be granted 3,000 stock options on January 3,
1995, and the options will be fully vested on January 3, 1996.

      If a Retiring Director is renominated to serve on the Board of Directors
for an additional four-year period, such  Retiring Director will be treated as
a new director for purposes of determining compensation during such additional
four-year period.

      During the  year ended  June 29, 1994, the  Board of Directors  held six
meetings; all incumbent directors were present at all of the meetings with the
exception of Mr. Hunt who was unable to attend two meetings.

                       SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT
                           AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

      Fifteen (15) directors are to  be elected at the meeting.   Each nominee
will  be  elected  to  hold  office  until  the  next  annual  meeting of  the
shareholders or  until his or her  successor is elected and  qualified.  Proxy
holders will  not be able to  vote the proxies held  by them for  more than 15
persons.   To be elected a director, each nominee  must receive a plurality of
all of  the votes cast at the  meeting for the election  of directors.  Should
any nominee become unable  or unwilling to accept nomination or  election, the
proxy holders may  vote the proxies for the election, in  his or her stead, of
any other  person the  Board of  Directors may recommend.   All  nominees have
expressed  their intention  to serve  the entire  term for  which  election is
sought.    The  following  table  sets forth  certain  information  concerning
security ownership of  management and  the persons nominated  for election  as

      The Company has established  a guideline that all senior officers of the
Company own  stock in the Company,  believing that it is  important to further
encourage  and support an ownership  mentality among the  senior officers that
will continue to align  their personal financial interests with  the long-term
interests  of  the Company's  shareholders.   Pursuant  to the  guideline, the
minimum amount of Company Common Stock that a senior officer  will be required
to own  will be determined  by such officer's  position within the  Company as
well as annual  compensation.  The  guideline requires  that each Senior  Vice
President own an amount of  Common Stock equal in value to such officer's base
salary, each Executive  Vice President own an amount of  Common Stock equal in
value to  twice such officer's  base salary,  the President own  an amount  of
Common Stock  equal in  value to three  times his base  salary, and  the Chief
Executive Officer  own an amount of Common Stock equal  in value to four times
his base  salary.  The  guideline also  encourages all other  officers of  the
Company to similarly acquire Common Stock in the Company.  It is expected that
phase-in  of the guideline  will begin  by the end  of 1994,  for those senior
officers who  do not  currently meet  the minimum  stock  ownership levels  as
established by the guideline.
