				  PART I

Item 1.  Business.

General

    Digital Equipment Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation founded in 
1957, is one of the world's largest suppliers of networked computer systems 
and components, software and services and a world leader in the development 
and implementation, directly and through partners, of client/server 
solutions for open computing environments.  The Corporation offers a full 
range of desktop, client/server and production systems and related 
components, peripheral equipment, software and services used in a wide 
variety of applications, industries and computing environments.  The 
Corporation does business in more than 100 countries, deriving more than 
60% of its revenue from outside of the United States and developing and 
manufacturing products in the Americas, Europe and the Pacific Rim.

    The term "Corporation" when used herein refers to Digital Equipment 
Corporation or Digital Equipment Corporation and its subsidiaries, as 
required by the context.

    For the last five fiscal years, the percentage of total operating 
revenues contributed by the Corporation's principal classes of products was 
as follows:

			     1994      1993      1992      1991      1990

Product sales                53.5%     52.8%     55.2%     59.7%     62.9%   
Service and other revenues   46.5%     47.2%     44.8%     40.3%     37.1%    
			    100.0%    100.0%    100.0%    100.0%    100.0% 
			    ======    ======    ======    ======    ======

    Service and other revenues are derived principally from Digital and 
multivendor hardware and software product services and systems integration 
services.

Products

    Systems and Products:  Most of the Corporation's systems are general 
purpose digital computers, designed to perform, interpret and record 
computations on collected data or act as servers providing computing 
resources across a network.  The Corporation offers a broad range of 
computer systems and servers based on Digital's Alpha AXP(TM) and VAX(R) 
architectures, and the Intel(R) X86 architecture.  

    The Corporation's offerings include a line of VAX systems and servers, 
from VAXstation(TM) workstations to high performance servers.  The 
Corporation also offers a full range of Intel-based and industry compatible 
personal computers and network hardware and desktop integration products.  
In addition, the Corporation is a major manufacturer and supplier of video 
terminals, printers and network components, such as hubs, routers and 
switches.  

    Alpha AXP:  The Corporation's 64-bit, reduced instruction set computing 
("RISC") architecture known as "Alpha AXP(TM)" is designed to support 
multiple operating systems and to be the foundation for a leading high 
performance computer system family.  The Corporation offers a complete line 
of Alpha AXP-based products, ranging from chips and boards to personal 
computers and high performance workstations to larger general purpose 
computer systems.  Alpha AXP supports three major operating systems: the 
Open Software Foundation's 64-bit unified UNIX(R) operating system (DEC 
OSF/1)(R), the Corporation's OpenVMS(TM) operating system and Microsoft 
Corporation's Windows NT(R) operating system.  In April 1994, the 
Corporation introduced a new line of competitively priced, high performance 
Alpha AXP-based servers, the Digital 2100 series, which support symmetrical 
multiprocessing.  
    
    Storage Business:  Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the 
Corporation announced it had reached agreement with Quantum Corporation for 
the sale of portions of its storage business, including its magnetic disk 
drive, tape drive, solid state disk and thin-film heads businesses.  The 
Corporation expects to continue to offer peripheral and data storage 
products for use with its computer systems after the transaction is 
complete.

    Software:  The Corporation designs, develops or acquires from third 
parties and distributes under license various software products for use on 
its computer systems and computer systems from other vendors.  These 
products consist of operating systems, communication and networking 
software, run-time services (such as data/information handling and 
graphical user interfaces), language compilers, productivity tools, 
production systems (including databases and transaction processing 
monitors), office and workgroup software frameworks, and other application 
software.  

    The Corporation's software offerings are intended to promote open 
client/server computing and, to this end, are designed to industry-standard 
interfaces that enable applications to work across different platforms and 
operating systems.  During the fiscal year, the Corporation announced the 
development of several software products that support this strategy, 
including its LinkWorks(TM) offerings.  In addition, in November 1993 the 
Corporation announced a joint effort with Microsoft Corporation to develop 
the Common Object Model, a set of software standards that are designed to 
enable software objects in different operating systems, data formats and 
geographical locations to work together across a network.

Services  

    The Corporation provides a comprehensive portfolio of technical 
consulting, systems integration and support services to help customers 
plan, implement and manage their information technology solutions through a 
global network of employees and partners.  

    The Corporation's services offerings include maintenance and support 
services for the Corporation's products, as well as for products 
manufactured by other companies; information systems consulting; technical 
and application design services; education and customer training services; 
systems integration and project management services; network design and 
support services; and outsourcing and resource management services.

Sales and Distribution

    The Corporation directly sells, markets and supports its products 
and services through approximately 725 locations throughout the world.  
Arrangements with third parties, including software developers, value added 
resellers (VARs) and authorized distributors, are an increasingly important 
part of the Corporation's focus on providing complete solutions to its 
customers and expanding distribution of its products and services through 
indirect channels. 

    For the fiscal year ended July 2, 1994, approximately 3.3% of the 
Corporation's total operating revenues were derived directly from sales to 
various agencies of the U.S. Government, and no other customer of the 
Corporation accounted for more than 2% of total revenues.
    
    The Corporation believes that the dollar amount of backlog is 
not a meaningful indication of future revenues and historically has not 
published such data.  It has been and continues to be the Corporation's 
objective to minimize the time from the receipt of a purchase order to 
delivery of the product.

International Operations

    Sales by the Corporation to customers outside the United States 
amounted to 62%, 64% and 63% of total operating revenues for the fiscal 
years ended July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, respectively.  
International sales and marketing operations are conducted through 
subsidiaries, by direct sales from the parent company, by resellers and 
through various representative and distributorship arrangements.  
 
    The Corporation's international business is subject to risks 
customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in 
monetary exchange rates, import and export controls and the economic, 
political and regulatory policies of foreign governments.  In view of the 
diversification of the Corporation's international activities, the 
Corporation does not believe that there are any special risks beyond the 
normal business risks attendant to conducting business abroad.  

    See Notes A, B and I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
incorporated by reference herein, for further information on the 
Corporation's international operations, including financial information 
concerning the Corporation's operations by major geographical area.

Competition

    The information technology industry is highly competitive, 
international in scope and comprised of many companies.  The methods of 
competition include marketing, product performance, price, service, 
technology and compliance with various industry standards, among others.    
Present and potential competition in the various markets served by the 
Corporation comes from firms of various sizes and types, some of which are 
larger and have greater resources than the Corporation.  Firms not 
now in direct competition with the Corporation may introduce competing 
products in the future.  It is possible for companies to be at various 
times competitors, customers and collaborators in different markets.  

Materials

     The Corporation obtains a wide variety of components, assemblies and 
raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers.  The Corporation has 
established or has available alternate sources of supply for many of these 
materials.  The Corporation believes that the materials required for its 
manufacturing operations are presently available in quantities sufficient 
to meet demand; however, a portion of the Corporation's manufacturing 
operations is dependent on the timely delivery of certain sub-assemblies 
and components from significant suppliers. The failure of such suppliers to 
deliver such items on a timely basis could adversely affect the 
Corporation's operating results until alternative sources of supply could 
be arranged. 

Environmental Affairs

    The Corporation's facilities are subject to numerous laws and 
regulations designed to protect human health and safety and the 
environment, particularly those relating to manufacturing and engineering, 
chemical usage, waste and emissions.  Pursuant to the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), 
as amended, the Corporation has been notified that it is a potentially 
responsible party ("PRP") for and is sharing the costs of investigating and 
cleaning up certain sites listed on the federal National Priorities List of 
Superfund Sites.  Under similar state laws, the Corporation also is 
incurring costs in connection with the investigation and remediation of 
certain properties owned and/or operated by the Corporation.  In the 
opinion of the Corporation, compliance with these laws and regulations has 
not had and should not have a material effect on the capital expenditures, 
earnings or competitive position of the Corporation.                       

Patents 

The Corporation owns or is licensed under a number of patents and patent 
applications relating to its products.  While the Corporation's portfolio 
of patents and patent applications is of significant value to the 
Corporation, the Corporation does not believe that any particular patent or 
group of patents is of material importance to the Corporation's business as 
a whole.  

Research and Engineering

    The Corporation is in an industry which is characterized by rapid 
technological change.  In the fiscal years ended July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993 
and June 27, 1992, the Corporation spent $1.30 billion, $1.53 billion and 
$1.75 billion, respectively, for research and engineering (R&E).  Although 
the Corporation expects to continue its ongoing R&E efficiency initiatives, 
it also expects to continue to invest heavily in R&E to maintain and 
strengthen its competitive position.

Employees

    The Corporation had approximately 77,800 regular employees, and an 
additional 5,000 temporary and contract workers worldwide at July 2, 1994.

managerial positions in the Corporation for at least the last five years, 
except Messrs. Christ, Pesatori and Prokopis.  Prior to joining the 
Corporation, these officers held the following positions:  Mr. Christ, who

Item 2.  Properties

    At the end of fiscal 1994, the Corporation owned or leased 
approximately 39.1 million square feet of space worldwide.  The Corporation 
occupied approximately 32.3 million square feet, leased or sub-leased 
to others approximately 1.3 million square feet, and due to restructuring 
actions, had vacant space of approximately 5.5 million square feet, most of 
which is available for sale or sub-lease.  The total space owned or leased 
decreased by approximately 3.0 million square feet from the prior year.  
Approximately 54% of the occupied space is located in the United States;
approximately 59% of the occupied space is owned.  The Corporation's 
occupied facilities are substantially utilized, well maintained and 
suitable for the products and services offered by the Corporation.

    Approximately 500,000 square feet of space for new manufacturing 
facilities is under construction and scheduled for completion during fiscal 
1995.  The Corporation anticipates it will occupy fewer square feet of 
space worldwide at the end of fiscal 1995 than at the end of fiscal 1994.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

    The Corporation has been named as a defendant in several purported 
class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of New York and the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Massachusetts alleging violations of the Federal securities laws in 
connection with the Corporation's issuance and sale of Series A 8-7/8% 
Cumulative Preferred Stock and the Corporation's financial results for the 
fiscal quarter ended April 2, 1994.  (See Note H of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.)

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

                 Digital Restricted Distribution
FY95DESC.DOC                                  30 August 1994
                                
                  Digital Equipment Corporation
                                
           Description of the FY95 Cash Incentive Plan


Intent

The FY95 Cash Incentive Plan (CIP or the "Plan") was approved  by
the Board of Directors in June 1994.  It provides the funding  of
all   management   cash   incentive  programs<1> throughout the
Corporation   based  on  overall  corporate  and   organizational
performance   and   establishes  the   framework   within   which
organizational programs will award these funds to individuals.

The intent of this document is to give an overview of CIP and its
design features.

Concept

The  purpose of the Cash Incentive Plan is to motivate and reward
superior  performance  in a given year.   In  addition,  the  CIP
should  play  a key role in helping to establish and emphasize  a
performance-oriented culture, which is based on both team  effort
and clear organizational accountabilities.  Awards made under the
Plan  will  be based primarily on the achievement of  performance
goals  and  business  objectives, and  yet  allow  the  Board  of
Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, and management the use of
judgment in assessing performance and determining payouts.

The  Plan  has  been undergoing, and will continue to  undergo  a
transition  from one based primarily on corporate  results,  with
adjustments  for  unit performance, to one that clearly  reflects
the  independent  performance  of individual  organizations.   In
FY95,  the  decision  to  fund  the  plan  by  both  Company  and
organizational  performance reflects the  current  phase  of  our
Company   transformation,  and  a  continued  need  to  emphasize
teamwork and the Corporation's overall performance.

Eligibility/Participation

Eligibility for the Plan is limited to selected regular employees
(active or on short term disability), working 20 hours or greater
per  week,  and  in  SRI 40 and above in the U.S.  exempt  salary
structure or an international equivalent. For FY95 many  eligible
participants  will be identified and communicated with  early  in
the year.

However,  based  on performance and contribution, other  eligible
employees not previously communicated with early in the year  may
be selected to participate at year end.  In future years the plan
provides  that  all  eligible employees will  be  identified  and
receive notification at the beginning of the year.

Selection  of  participants will be conducted on  a  business  by
business  basis  to  ensure that participation reflects  business
objectives and competitive practice.

Incentive Targets

Incentive  award targets, expressed in either currency  or  as  a
percentage  of  base  salary,  will  be  established   for   each
identified  participant  in  the  Plan  at  the  time  of   their
selection.   Targets that are expressed as a percentage  will  be
based on the salary rate in effect at the beginning of the fiscal
year;  targets that are expressed in currency will be  fixed  for
the entire year.  The target incentive levels are established  to
be competitive with those offered by companies with which Digital
competes for employees and for the sale of products and services.
A  range  of  incentive opportunity, above and below  the  target
level, may be communicated to each identified participant.

Cash Incentive Plan Funding

For  FY95,  50%  of  the total CIP award fund will  be  based  on
overall  Digital  performance  in  relation  to  the  agreed-upon
business plan for the year. Digital performance will be based  on
Operating  Profit dollars actually achieved.  A funding  schedule
has been developed based on the following principles to provide a
range  of  total  funding  that is above  and  below  the  target
performance for the Corporation:

Outstanding  Results:  A level of performance  that,  considering
current business circumstances,  would reflect unusual success.

Target  Performance:  Reflects the attainment of the  agreed-upon
business plan.

Threshold  Performance:  A level of performance that, while  less
than plan, merits some incentive payout.

Performance  targets for the Cash Incentive Plan are expected  to
increase   over  time  whether  Digital's  business   performance
improves  or not.  It would not be appropriate to pay significant
bonuses  over the medium-to-long term without there  having  been
competitive returns to shareholders.
The other 50% of the total CIP Award Fund will be distributed  to
organizations based on their achievement of goals established  at
the  beginning  of  the year and independent of  overall  Company
performance.

Evaluation of Organizational Performance

The  allocation  of  the 50% organizational fund  will  recognize
business or organizational performance. This performance will  be
evaluated  on both objective and subjective criteria  established
at  the  beginning of the year.  In FY95 each major  organization
may  have  up to three goals identified for these purposes.   The
types  of  factors that might be included are profit,  cash  flow
from  operations, and return on assets.  Other measures  such  as
revenue, market share, successful new product introductions,  and
customer  satisfaction could also be adopted.  Staff areas  could
be   evaluated  on  cost  control,  the  attainment  of  specific
objectives,  and how responsive they are to the  needs  of  their
internal customers/clients.

The  overriding  objective is that the  Chief  Executive  Officer
engages in a candid dialogue with each of his direct reports, and
they  in  turn with their management teams regarding  performance
expectations and accountabilities.

Allocation of Awards, and Payments

A.   Allocations of the Total Funds Available:  Organizations are
allocated  funds from the total available fund after  the  fiscal
year  ends.  Fifty percent of the total available funds  will  be
allocated   to   organizations   based   on   the   Corporation's
performance.  The other fifty percent will be allocated based  on
organizational performance.

B.   Awards  to Individuals:  Organizations will make  awards  to
individuals  from their allocations, according  to  the  specific
program of the organization. These individual awards will  follow
the  commitments made to individuals identified at the  beginning
of  the  year, and follow guidelines for award amounts  to  other
individuals selected for participation at year end.   All  awards
to   individuals  must  be  made  based  on  their   demonstrated
performance. Actual payouts to identified participants will  vary
significantly around the target award  -- from no award to  twice
the  target award -- based on the Corporation, the business,  and
individual performance.

C. Award Payments: Awards are payable after the end of the fiscal
year  and  following the release of audited financial results  of
the  Corporation.   To  receive an incentive award,  participants
must be:

1) employed by the Corporation at the time awards are paid, and;

2) an active employee for a minimum of three months during  the
   year, and;

3) assessed as having at least a satisfactory  performance
   rating.

Administration

The  Plan will be administered by the Compensation and Stock
Option Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Committee will
have the authority to make all decisions regarding the operation
of the Plan.

Unusual Events

The purpose of the Plan is to motivate and reward superior
performance.  Therefore, in extraordinary situations, adjustments
may  be made to retain the motivational impact of the Plan. The
Compensation and Stock Option Committee retains the discretion to
make the changes necessary to ensure the Plan's motivational
impact and provide a fair return to shareholders.

February 2, 1993



Mr. Enrico Pesatori
219 East Lake Shore Drive
Apartment 6D
Chicago, IL  60611

Re:  Offer of Employment

Dear Enrico:

     
As the letter dated December 21, 1992, contemplated, the
following provisions shall constitute the terms and conditions
upon which you shall be employed with Digital Equipment
Corporation ("Digital" or the "Company")).

1.   Status

You will be employed as of February 3, 1993, as a regular
employee with the title of Vice President and General Manager,
Personal Computer Business Unit, on an at-will basis and your
employment shall continue for so long as it is mutually
agreeable to both parties; provided, however, that your
employment will not be terminated during the first six months of
employment, and during the second six months, only on six
months' prior written notice.  In this capacity, you will be a
member of the Senior Leadership Team.

2.   Compensation

Your beginning annual rate of base compensation will be
$550,000.00, which is payable weekly (or on such other basis as
may be applicable to senior executives generally as Digital
shall determine from time to time).  Your rate of base pay will
be reviewed periodically and adjusted accordingly in light of
the compensation practices and policies in effect from time to
time.

You will participate in Digital's short-term incentive
compensation program.  Any payment thereunder will be made
solely in the discretion of Digital's Board of Directors (the
"Board"), subject to the Company's performance, which is the
same basis on which the other members of the Senior Leadership
Team participate.  If payment under this program is made to
other members of the Senior Leadership Team, a payment will be
made to you as well.  It will be recommended that your target
participation range will be at least $200,000 for on-plan
performance, pro-rated for the number of months of the fiscal
year during which you are employed by Digital; provided,
however, no less than $100,000 will be paid to you under this
program for fiscal year 1993.

3.   Stock Awards

The Board has approved an award to you effective on your date of
hire and contingent on your actually being employed by Digital,
which grants you a stock award of 10,000 shares of Digital
common stock under the 1990 Equity Plan, which will be evidenced
by a separate award letter, to vest in equal amounts over a
five-year period from the effective date of the award.  All
vesting restrictions on such stock shall lapse if your
employment is terminated by the Company for reasons other than
for "cause" or by you for "good reason" (as each such term is
defined in Paragraph 7, below).  You will be solely responsible
for any income tax consequences (including making a Section
83(b) election) associated with your receipt of such an award.

The Board has approved an award to you effective on your date of
hire and contingent on your actually being employed by Digital,
which grants you an award of a non-qualified stock option with
respect to 30,000 shares of Digital common stock at an option
price of $35.00 under the 1990 Equity Plan, which will be
evidenced by a separate award letter, to become exercisable in
equal amounts over a five-year period from the effective date of
the award. All vesting restrictions on such stock shall lapse if
your employment is terminated by the Company for reasons other
than for "cause" or by you for "good reason" (as each such term
is defined in Paragraph 7, below). 

4.   Loan

The Board has approved a loan to you, contingent on your actually 
being employed by Digital, in the principal amount of
$150,000.00 for the sole purpose of purchasing a new principal
residence in the Boston area, which shall be secured by a second
mortgage.  You agree to execute a promissory note with terms
substantially as set forth in the attached form of promissory
note and execute such other documents which the Company
determines to be necessary or desirable to effect such security
and to establish the tax-free nature of the transaction under
Section 7872 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the regulations thereunder.

5.   Confidentiality Agreement

You will be required to sign Digital's Employee Invention and
Confidential Agreement (the "Confidentiality Agreement") as of
your date of hire, a copy of which is attached. 

6.   Employee Benefits

As a regular employee, you will be eligible to participate in
Digital's employee benefit plans, such as pension, savings,
disability, life insurance, medical coverage, dental coverage,
and cafeteria arrangements under the terms as separately
provided for under each such plan or arrangement, except as are
provided for below.  To the extent necessary, Digital will
provide medical and dental coverage for your dependents who
reside outside of the United States under Company-provided
medical and dental plans for employees (and their dependents)
who are employed by the Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate,
as the case may be) in Italy.  Moreover, to the extent it is
feasible to do so, Digital will make no contributions on your
behalf under the U.S. Social Security system and will make or
cause to be made such comparable contributions on your behalf
under the pension system in Italy.  All other fringe benefit
arrangements that are provided to regular employees will be
provided to you except that you will be eligible for four weeks
of vacation on an annual basis.

7.   Severance

If, prior to February 3, 1997, (a) you voluntarily terminate
your employment hereunder for good reason (as defined below), or
(b) Digital terminates your employment hereunder other than for
cause (as defined below), then, in either such event (each, a
"Severance Event"), Digital will, for a period of two years from
the date of such Severance Event, (i) continue to pay you your
base compensation as constituted at the time of the Severance
Event and (ii) provide you and your dependents with life
insurance, medical, dental and pension benefits equivalent to
those provided at the time of the Severance Event (collectively,
the "Severance Package"); provided, however, that if, at any
time during the two-year period following such Severance Event,
you accept employment (as defined below) with any entity which
competes (as defined below) with or if you publicly criticize
Digital, then Digital shall not be obliged to continue to
provide the Severance Package after such acceptance or
criticism, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, neither (a) your acceptance of
employment with any entity which does not compete with Digital,
nor (b) your failure to attempt to find other employment will
entitle Digital to discontinue the Severance Package. If so
requested by Digital, at the time of the Severance Event you
agree to enter into a separate agreement with Digital containing
the terms of this Paragraph 7.
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 7, the following terms shall have
the meanings set forth below:

(i)  Being "employed" or "employment" means having a common law
     employment relationship with another entity or engaging in any
     other comparable position such as independent contractor for,
     owner of, consultant to, or partner with or of another entity.

(ii) "Cause" means (a) the commission of a serious willful act
     against Digital by which you intended to enrich yourself at the
     expense of Digital (which may be evidenced by your arrest for,
     or conviction, guilty plea, or plea of nolo contendere of a
     crime involving moral turpitude); (b) your continued failure to
     perform your duties hereunder in one or more material respects
     through continued inattention or neglect (except that which is a
     result of your illness or disability), which failure does not
     cease within 15 days after written notice thereof specifying the
     details of such conduct is given to you by the Board; or (c)
     your willful misconduct which has caused or has a high
     likelihood of causing material harm to Digital; or (d) the
     breach of one or more terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(iii) "Good reason" means Digital's (a) effecting without your
     consent a material change in the nature or scope of your
     authority, powers, functions, duties, or responsibilities of the
     position for which you are employed; (b) the reduction of your
     base compensation or benefits provided to you pursuant to
     Paragraph 6 hereof that are provided to all senior executives
     generally (other than as a result of actions by Digital that
     affect all senior executives generally) or benefits specifically
     provided to you hereunder; (c) requiring you to relocate to an
     area more than 50 miles from Maynard, Massachusetts; or (d) the
     breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

(iv) "Compete" means rendering services directly or indirectly
     to, becoming associated with or employed in any capacity by, or
     having any ownership interest in any individual, firm,
     corporation, or other entity engaged in or actively planning to
     engage in any activities  competitive with those activities of
     Digital with respect to which you have managed, or with respect
     to which you possessed or had access to Digital's confidential
     information, know-how or trade secrets (including but not
     limited to information, know-how, or trade secrets relating to
     the research, development, design, manufacture, marketing, sale,
     or distribution of any Digital product or service with respect
     to which you possessed or had access to Digital's confidential
     information, know-how, or trade secrets).  For purposes of this
     definition, "Digital" shall include Digital and any of its
     subsidiaries and affiliates.

8.   Relocation

You will be provided with the standard relocation benefits
offered transferring employees, including temporary housing for
up to 6 months.  In addition, Digital will reimburse you up to
$20,000 for rent payments that you are required to make with
respect to your primary residence in the Chicago area for
periods of time after the date your employment with Digital
commences, upon request and receipt by Digital of appropriate
documentation.

9.   Legal Fees and Assistance

Digital will reimburse you, upon request and receipt by Digital
of appropriate documentation, for legal fees you incur for
counsel provided to you in connection with your employment with
Digital, such reimbursement not to exceed $5,000.

Upon request, Digital also agrees to provide you with assistance
from the Law Department with regard to matters involving your
termination of employment from your last employer.

10.  Personnel Policies and Procedures

Unless specifically excepted for above, your employment with
Digital will be subject to Digital's personnel policies and
procedures as amended from time to time.


11.  Legal Status

Notwithstanding the foregoing, your employment with Digital is
contingent on Digital's ability to verify your identity and
employment eligibility as required by federal law.


12.  Merger

This Agreement includes all of the agreements of the parties
relative to your employment with Digital, and supersedes any
prior agreements or representations between the parties as to
the subjects covered.

Please indicate your understanding and consent to the foregoing
by signing and dating the copy of this letter and returning it
to the undersigned.


Very truly yours,

/s/ Robert B. Palmer
Robert B. Palmer
President and CEO


I have read and agree to the terms as stated above.

                                 AGREEMENT

                                                                   


WHEREAS, DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its officers, agents, directors, employees, assigns and
successors ("Digital") and Edward E. Lucente on his own behalf and
on behalf of his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns ("Mr.
Lucente") have reached an amicable settlement regarding the
conditions of Mr. Lucente's voluntary resignation from his
employment with Digital.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
undertakings set forth herein, Digital and Mr. Lucente hereby agree
as follows:


  1 .  Mr. Lucente voluntarily resigns his employment with Digital
       effective as of April 29, 1994  (the "Effective Date").

  2.   Digital accepts Mr. Lucente's resignation as an officer and
       as an employee of Digital as of his Effective Date.  Payment
       provided for under this Agreement shall not be construed in
       any way to extend Mr. Lucente's employment or employment
       status with Digital beyond the Effective Date. 

  3.   a.   Digital and Mr. Lucente contemplate that he will
            continue active employment with Digital until his
            Effective Date.  During his period of active
            employment, Mr. Lucente shall continue to be paid at
            his current base rate of pay and shall be treated as an
            active employee in all respects.  Should Mr. Lucente
            obtain and commence employment outside of Digital
            before his Effective Date, his employment with Digital
            shall immediately cease as of the date he commences
            such outside employment, and such date shall be deemed
            to be the Effective Date.

       b.   Digital and Mr. Lucente agree that Mr. Lucente will be
            generally available to consult informally with the
            President and other designated executives of Digital
            for a period of one year from the Effective Date.  It
            is understood that from and after the Effective Date,
            Mr. Lucente is otherwise free to engage in any activity
            that he may desire to pursue, whether or not he
            receives any remuneration therefor, provided that such
            activity is not prohibited under any other provision of
            this Agreement.  If Mr. Lucente is asked to undertake
            specific assignments on behalf of Digital, he may
            decline to do so without consequence;  if he agrees to
            do so, he shall not receive any additional compensation
            other than that which is provided for in Paragraph 6. 
 
  4.   Mr. Lucente agrees that he shall not become employed by
       a "competitor" of Digital as such term is defined below
       at any time prior to the date that is 12 months
       following his Effective Date.

  5.   A competitor of Digital shall be defined as, and limited to,
       any of the following companies or any subsidiary of one of
       the following companies, in which the parent company owns,
       directly or indirectly, a controlling interest.

            $282,502.80 shall be paid as soon as practicable after
            the expiration of the seven-day revocation period, as
            described in Paragraph 10, below.  Subsequent
            installments of $157,502.80, $157,502.80, and
            $32,502.80, respectively, shall be paid quarterly
            beginning August 1, 1994; provided, however, that the
            third and fourth quarterly payments shall be made only
            if Mr. Lucente is not employed with another entity at
            an annualized rate of compensation of at least $300,000
            during any period after the Effective Date.  Each
            installment payable under this subparagraph (a) shall
            be less any amount required of Digital by law to be
            withheld as income tax withholding or elected to be
            deducted by Mr. Lucente on a voluntary basis.  Actual
            payment of each installment shall be made as soon as
            reasonably possible after the respective payment date.

            For purposes of Paragraphs 6, 9, and 11,  being
            "employed" or "employment" means entering into a
            relationship with an entity as a common law employee,
            consultant, independent contractor, partner, or owner
            or any other comparable relationship.  For purposes of
            Paragraph 7, the term "employer" shall be inclusive of
            such relationships with another entity which are not
            common law employment relationships.

       b.   Digital shall also pay to Mr. Lucente as soon as
            practicable after the Effective Date, a lump sum
            payment equal to the value of his then accrued and
            unused vacation time and personal holiday.

       c.   Mr. Lucente shall continue presently elected and paid
            for health, dental, life insurance, and disability
            benefits at the then current cost of such benefits to
            active employees until his Effective Date.  Digital
            agrees to continue his health, dental, basic and
            personal accident (if applicable) life insurance
            benefits for a period of twelve months from the
            Effective Date, or until he becomes eligible for such
            coverage by virtue of other employment, whichever
            occurs first, provided that Mr. Lucente continues to
            make timely payment therefor subject to whatever
            applicable changes, including cost, that are
            implemented by Digital to such plans.  Group universal
            life insurance coverage shall be continued under the
            terms of that policy. Thereafter, Mr. Lucente shall be
            entitled to continued health and dental coverage under
            the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
            1986 (COBRA) at the same cost to Mr. Lucente as for any
            other employee who terminates on Mr. Lucente's
            Effective Date for the same coverage, such coverage to
            be for a period not to exceed the statutory limit.

       d.   Digital shall provide at its expense executive
            outplacement services to Mr. Lucente.  Mr. Lucente may
            choose a firm from the list of approved vendors and may
            begin to use such services upon execution of this
            Agreement.

       e.   Mr. Lucente shall continue to participate in Digital's
            Pension Plan and to accrue benefit service subject to
            the terms and conditions of said Plan until his
            Effective Date.  Thereafter, his rights in said Plan
            shall be determined under the terms of the Plan.

  7.   Mr. Lucente agrees not to actively recruit any Digital
       employees on behalf of his future employer or employers and
       not to utilize his knowledge of Digital and Digital's
       employees to encourage their recruitment from Digital by his
       future employer or employers for a period ending one year
       after his Effective Date.  The foregoing sentence does not
       prohibit Mr. Lucente or his employers from entertaining and
       accepting requests for employment from Digital employees as
       long as they were not solicited by him.  He further agrees
       not to make any derogatory comments to persons or third
       parties regarding his employment with Digital during the
       period ending two years after his Effective Date.

  8.   Mr. Lucente agrees not to disclose or use any of Digital's
       confidential information or confidential information
       entrusted to Digital by others to any non-Digital person,
       corporation, or other entity. Digital's confidential
       information includes matters not generally known outside of
       Digital, such as experimentation, research and developments
       relating to existing and future products and services
       marketed or used by Digital, and also any information which
       gives Digital a competitive advantage including data
       relating to the general business operations of Digital
       (i.e., sales, costs, profits, organizations, customer lists,
       pricing methods, etc.).  

  9.   Mr. Lucente agrees to notify the President of Digital (or
       his designee) within one week of accepting new employment
       with another entity of the name and address thereof and the
       annualized rate of compensation that he will be paid by such
       entity, provided that the beginning date of such employment
       is prior to April 1, 1995.

 10.   Mr. Lucente accepts the foregoing in full and complete
       satisfaction of any and all claims of any kind or
       description that he has or may have had or may have against
       Digital or its officers, directors or employees to the date
       of the execution of this Agreement including but not limited
       to claims arising from any employment relations laws,
       contract or tort law, public policy, law or equity or claims
       for expenses or other monetary or equitable relief including
       any right to or claim arising out of a right, to
       re-employment.  Mr. Lucente also releases Digital and its
       officers, directors, agents and employees from liability for
       such claims and waives any other rights relating to his
       employment with, or his resignation from employment from,
       Digital.  This Agreement shall serve to inform Mr. Lucente
       that Digital advises him to consult counsel before signing
       this Agreement in order to assist him in considering his
       rights and obligations as expressed in this Agreement prior
       to his determining whether or not to sign it.  Mr. Lucente
       has a period of 21 days from the date he receives this
       Agreement to accept this Agreement by signing in the space
       indicated below and returning the signed Agreement to
       Digital.  He is also entitled to rescind this Agreement at
       any time within the seven-day period after he executes it by
       written notice to Digital. 
  
 11.   Neither Mr. Lucente nor Digital shall release, reveal,
       publish, cause to be published, publicize, discuss or
       otherwise disclose either the fact or terms of this
       Agreement except as provided for in Paragraph 12, below, and
       except as Digital may be obligated to disclose on account of
       statutory, regulatory, or other legal requirements or in
       connection with Mr. Lucente's compliance with the
       obligations described in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 or 8 and except
       that Mr. Lucente may make such disclosures (i) to family
       members or attorneys to whom he discloses such information
       on a confidential basis or (ii) that are consistent with,
       and only to the extent necessary to meet, his obligations
       expressed in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 or 8, above, with respect to
       his employment with prospective employers (as so defined
       therein).

  12.  Mr. Lucente agrees to cooperate with Digital and its counsel
       in the disposition of legal, administrative, or agency
       proceedings that now exist or may arise.  In this regard,
       Mr. Lucente agrees to make himself available for meetings,
       proceedings, depositions, etc. as may be reasonably
       required.

   13. The terms of this Agreement including all facts,
       circumstances, statements or documents relating thereto,
       shall not be admissible for any purpose in any litigation in
       any forum other than to secure enforcement of the terms and
       conditions of the Agreement.  It is agreed by Mr. Lucente
       and Digital that the consideration paid by Digital hereunder
       is in return for specific performance by Mr. Lucente and
       that Digital will seek and is entitled to specific
       performance by Mr. Lucente in the event of a violation of
       this Agreement by Mr. Lucente.
 
   14. This Agreement has been reached by mutual accord of the
       parties hereto, and the parties by their signatures indicate
       their full agreement and understanding of its terms.

   15. This Agreement includes all of the agreements of the parties
       relative to Mr. Lucente's termination, and supersedes any
       prior agreements or representations between the parties as
       to the subjects covered.  Without limiting the foregoing,
       the letter dated April 7, 1993, extending an offer of
       employment to Mr. Lucente is expressly superseded by this
       Agreement.  Mr. Lucente specifically agrees that nothing in
       this Agreement modifies his obligations and responsibilities
       under any prior Employee Agreement or Stock Option Agreement
       previously executed by him, including without limitation,
       any non-competition, protection of confidential information
       of Digital or others, and employee obligations clauses.

   16. This Agreement shall become effective upon execution of it
       by Mr. Lucente and the representative of Digital listed
       below.

                             AGREEMENT
                                                                 

               
This agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between Digital
Equipment Corporation, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
officers, agents, directors, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates,
assigns and successors (collectively, "Digital") and Gresham T.
Brebach, Jr.  (on your own behalf and on behalf of your heirs,
executors, administrators, and assigns) regarding the termination
of your employment with Digital.

In consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings set forth
herein, you and Digital hereby agree as follows:


     1 .  Your employment with Digital ended as of August 8, 1994 
          (the "Effective Date").
 
     2.   For a period of 6 months following your Effective
          Date, you will not render any services directly or
          indirectly to, or on behalf of, become associated
          with or employed in any capacity by, have an
          ownership interest in any individual, firm,
          corporation, or other entity listed on Exhibit I,
          hereto, or with respect to any other entity to the
          extent that such services, association, employment,
          or ownership interest relate to any activities
          competitive with or similar to those activities of
          Digital with respect to which you have managed or
          with respect to which you have possessed or have had
          access to Digital's confidential information, know-
          how, or trade secrets (including but not limited to
          information, know-how, or trade secrets relating to
          the research, development, design, manufacture,
          marketing, sale, or distribution of any Digital
          product or service).  

          At your request, Digital will discuss any potential
          employment or other comparable opportunity with you to
          determine whether the opportunity, if taken, would
          violate the terms of this Paragraph 2.  Digital will
          promptly respond to your inquiry and in its sole
          discretion may waive all or part of the provisions of
          this Paragraph 2 at your request, such waiver not to be
          unreasonably withheld.

     3.   You will inform each subsequent employer or
          person or entity with whom you becomes
          associated, prior to accepting such employment,
          of the existence of the obligation set forth in
          Paragraph 2 and provide a copy of the text of
          Paragraph 2 to such employer or other person or
          entity, provided that the beginning date of
          such  employment is within 6 months from the
          Effective Date.

     4.   You will notify Digital within one week of
          accepting new employment of the name and address
          thereof, provided that the beginning date of such
          employment is within 6 months from the Effective
          Date.

     5.   For a period of 6 months following the Effective Date,
          you will not directly or indirectly solicit for
          employment (either with yourself or with your employer at
          the time or any of such employer's affiliates) or hire
          (whether as an employee, consultant, or otherwise) any
          executive orother employee of Digital; provided, however,
          that in no event shall the provisions of this Paragraph 5
          be deemed to impose any obligation on you with respect to
          any solicitation or hiring where you neither have any
          control over, nor participate in, such action.  Without
          limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you request
          or consent (whether in writing or otherwise) that a third
          party (such as an employee of a recruiting firm) take any
          action which, if taken by yourself, would be a violation
          of the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 5, you 
          shall be deemed to "participate in" such action.  It
          shall not be a violation of this 

          Paragraph 5 if you solicit or hire, as those terms are
          defined above, any secretary with whom you worked at
          Digital, or if you hire any employee who has been
          terminated by Digital under a transition layoff plan or
          business spin off.

     6.   You will not disclose or use any of Digital's
          confidential information or confidential information
          entrusted to Digital by others to any non-Digital person,
          corporation, or other entity. Digital's confidential
          information includes matters not generally known outside
          of Digital, such as experimentation, research and
          developments relating to existing and future products and
          services marketed or used by Digital, and also any
          information relating to the general business operations
          of Digital (including, but limited to, business
          strategies, sales, costs, profits, organizations,
          customer lists, and pricing methods).

     7.   You will refrain from seeking or accepting any
          employment, re-employment or work of any sort (temporary,
          contract, consultant, regular, part-time or other) with
          or at Digital.

     8.   On or before expiration of the seven-day revocation
          period described in Paragraph 10, you will have settled
          all expense accounts and advances made by Digital to you
          and completed all other procedures required of
          terminating employees, and you will have returned to
          Digital all property provided by Digital to you including
          all credit, identification, and entry cards, equipment,
          (except as provided for in Paragraph 9(f), below),
          automobiles, and all documents, records, papers,
          notebooks, and other materials and copies thereof
          (regardless of the medium on which the copy is made)
          related to or including any information which is
          confidential to Digital.

     9.   Digital, without admitting and while expressly
          denying the commission of any wrongful act,
          including but not limited to any violations of
          any federal, state or local fair employment
          practice law, or other employment practice law,
          or other employer duty or other
          employment-related obligation (all of which are
          hereinafter referred to as "employment
          relations laws") or other equity, will provide
          the following:
          
          a.   Payment of $58,333.33 on the first day of each
               calendar month beginning with September 1994 and
               ending in February 1995 (a total of six such
               payments.)  In no case will actual payment be made
               prior to the expiration of the seven-day revocation
               period described in Paragraph 10.   Actual payment
               shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable
               after each such date.  Each payment made under this
               Paragraph 9 shall be less any amount required of
               Digital by law to be withheld or elected to be
               withheld by you on a voluntary basis.
               
               For purposes of Paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 8, 9(a), and
               9(c) of the Agreement, being "employed" or
               "employment" means entering into a relationship with
               an entity such as a common law employee, consultant,
               independent contractor, partner, or owner or any
               other comparable relationship.

          b.   On or before September 1, 1994, payment (i) in a
               single sum equal to the value of your then accrued
               and unused vacation time and (ii) in a single sum
               equal to $150,000.00 as the remainder of the short-
               term incentive compensation payment with respect to
               fiscal year 1994, payable pursuant to the letter
               agreement dated April 5, 1993, which outlined the
               terms of Digital's offer of employment to you.

          c.   Continuation of elected and paid for health, dental,
               life insurance, and disability benefits at the then
               current cost of such benefits to active employees
               until your Effective Date.  Digital agrees to
               continue your health, dental, and basic and personal
               accident (if applicable) life insurance benefits
               through February 8, 1995, or until you become
               eligible for such coverage from another employer,
               whichever occurs first, provided that you continue
               to make timely payment therefor, subject to whatever
               applicable changes are implemented by Digital to
               such plans.  Group universal life insurance coverage
               in effect at the Effective Date shall be continued
               under the terms of that policy.  Thereafter, you
               shall be entitled to continued health and dental
               coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
               Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) at the same cost
               to you as for any other employee for the same
               coverage, such coverage to be for a period not to
               exceed the statutory limit.

          d.   Continuation of your participation in the Digital
               Equipment Corporation Pension Plan and the Digital
               Equipment Corporation Savings and Investment Plan
               (the "Plans") under the terms and conditions of the
               Plans until your Effective Date.  Thereafter, your
               rights in the Plans, if any, shall be determined
               under the terms of the Plans.

          e.   Executive outplacement services with a firm of your
               choice from an approved list of vendors.  You may
               begin to use such services upon execution of the
               Agreement.

          f.   Retention at no cost to you of the equipment
               previously provided to you by Digital, currently
               located in your home and your Digital office which
               is listed on Exhibit II, hereto.

     10.  In exchange for the consideration set forth above and for
          other good and valuable consideration receipt of which is
          hereby acknowledged: 

          a.   You hereby accept the foregoing, in full and
               complete waiver, release, and satisfaction of any
               and all claims of any kind or description that you
               have or may have had or may have through the date
               you execute the Agreement against Digital or its
               officers, directors or employees including but not
               limited to claims arising from any employment
               relations laws, contract or tort law, public policy,
               law or equity or claims for expenses or other
               monetary or equitable relief including any right to
               or claim arising out of a right, to re-employment. 
               You also hereby release Digital from liability for
               such claims and waive any other rights relating to
               your employment, or your termination from
               employment, with Digital.  This release shall
               include a release from claims under the Age
               Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). 
               Digital hereby advises you to consult counsel before
               signing the Agreement and that you have, and are
               entitled to, at least 21 days following the receipt
               of the Agreement to execute it, although you are not
               required to use all of this period if in your sole
               and unlimited discretion and judgment you choose not
               to do so.  You are also entitled to rescind the
               Agreement at any time within the seven-day period

               encourage, induce, solicit or support the filing of,
               or institution of any claim, suit, litigation,
               grievance, arbitration, cause of action, or any

               or persons based on claims released in Paragraph
               10(a) or similar claims of third parties, whether or
               not such claims arise from any employment relations
               laws, including but not limited to claims based on
               discrimination on the basis of age, sex, handicap,
               disability, contract or tort law, public policy, law
               or equity or claims for expenses or other monetary
               or equitable relief. 

               Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be
               prohibited from giving testimony in lawsuits or
               administrative proceedings initiated by third
               parties if such testimony is compelled by legal
               and/or administrative subpoena.  You shall not
               volunteer to provide such testimony and/or
               encourage, induce or solicit others to call you as a
               witness.

     11.  It is further agreed by you and Digital that the
          consideration paid by Digital hereunder is in return for
          specific performance by you, and that Digital will seek
          and is entitled to specific performance by you in the
          event of a violation of the Agreement by you in addition
          to any other remedies available to Digital.
  
     12.  Neither you nor Digital shall release, reveal, publish,
          cause to be published, publicize, discuss, or otherwise
          disclose the facts or terms of the Agreement except as
          provided for herein and in Paragraph 3 of the Agreement
          and except as Digital may be obligated to disclose on
          account of any statutory, regulatory, or other legal
          requirements.  The terms of the Agreement including all
          facts, circumstances, statements or documents relating
          thereto, shall not be admissible for any purpose in any
          litigation in any forum other than to secure enforcement
          of the terms and conditions of the Agreement.  Both
          Digital and you agree not to publicly discuss, nor make
          any derogatory comments regarding, the facts and
          circumstances leading to your departure from Digital, but
          you may confirm that your departure was voluntary. 

     13.  The Agreement has been reached by mutual accord of the
          parties hereto, and the parties by their signatures
          indicate their full agreement and understanding of its
          terms.

     14.  The Agreement includes all of the agreements of the
          parties relative to your termination, and supersedes any
          prior agreements or representations between the parties
          as to the subjects covered.  You specifically agree that
          nothing in the Agreement modifies your obligations and
          responsibilities under any prior Employee Agreement or
          Restricted Stock Option Agreement previously executed by
          you, including without limitation, any non-competition,
          protection of confidential information of Digital or
          others, and employee obligations clauses.  This Agreement
          has no precedential effect, value, or impact whatsoever
          as to any person not a party to it.

     15.  Should any provision or part of any provision of this
          Agreement be found to be legally unenforceable and/or
          against public policy, such unenforceability shall not
          prevent enforcement of the remaining provisions or parts
          of this Agreement.

     16.  The Agreement shall be interpreted under the laws of the
          Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

President's Letter

To Our Stockholders, Employees, Customers and Partners 

Fiscal year 1994 was a year of both progress and frustration for
stockholders, for employees, for our customers and for our partners. 

For the year, Digital reported a net loss of $2.16 billion, which includes
a restructuring charge of $1.2 billion and noncash asset write-offs and
accounting changes of $431 million. I am obviously disappointed with these
results. However, with the actions we took last year, including reducing
regular employee population by 12,000 and total occupied space by 5.2 million
square feet, and our announced restructuring plans for the future--for
example, the elimination of Digital's inefficient matrix management system--I
am confident that we have established a solid foundation for a return to
profitability.

As we exited the year, our business showed some positive and encouraging
signs: 
 
 We achieved year-over-year product order rate growth in both the third
 and fourth quarters (the latter adjusted for a 14-week quarter a year
 ago). This is the first time in nearly five years that we have seen an
 increase in year-over-year order rate growth in consecutive quarters. 

 We reached two significant milestones in our Alpha AXP program. We have 
 shipped more than one billion dollars' worth of Alpha AXP systems since 
 the program's launch in November 1992, and Alpha AXP revenues surpassed
 VAX revenues for the first time in the fourth quarter, growing 54 percent
 from the preceding quarter. 

 The new Digital 2100 Alpha AXP server, announced in the fourth quarter,
 got off to an excellent start. Market reception for this leadership 
 price/performance product, which offers exceptional scalability, has been 
 outstanding. 

 Personal computer revenues demonstrated accelerating year-over-year growth 
 rates each quarter, more than doubling in the fourth quarter and nearly 
 doubling for the full year. We enter fiscal 1995 with a balance sheet that 
 provides needed flexibility and resources and a portfolio of products and 
 services more competitive than they have been in several years. We all 
 want to see results quickly. We want the trauma of downsizing behind us 
 and a return to sustained profitability. But it is important that we do 
 not let our poor financial performance completely obscure the significant 
 progress we have made in several major dimensions in less than two years. 
  
We enter fiscal 1995 with a balance sheet that provides needed flexibility
and resources and a portfolio of products and services more competitive than
they have been in several years.

We all want to see results quickly.  We want the trauma of downsizing behind
us and a return to sustained profitability.  But it is important that we do
not let our poor financial performance completely obscure the significant
progress we have made in several major dimensions in less than two years.

Two years ago, our products were not competitive in performance or
price/performance. Digital was a company wedded to its proprietary systems,
with little or no credibility in the marketplace around our UNIX offering--a
key requirement to be a competitor in today's open environments. Once merely
an "also-ran," our UNIX is now a recognized leader in standards compliance
for open computing.
   
Today, Digital can lay legitimate claim to being a truly open systems leader,
giving customers the flexibility and alternatives that they want--and with
leadership price/performance. Today we can truly say we support
industry-standard operating systems--UNIX, OpenVMS, Windows NT and
MS-DOS--across a broad set of platforms. 
   
In two years, we have moved from being a company selling primarily through
direct channels to one that has a healthier, market-driven mix of direct and
indirect channels. In fiscal 1992, 29 percent of our products moved through
indirect channels; in the year just passed (fiscal 1994), we sold 45 percent
through indirect channels. And our goal for fiscal 1995 is more than 60
percent--which will be achieved in large part by a strategic refocus of our
core systems business models. 

We are moving from being a low-volume, high-cost manufacturer and supplier 
to a higher-volume, lower-cost manufacturer and supplier. Over the past two
years, unit volumes have exploded, driven by strong growth in PCs and Alpha
AXP workstations. We shipped nearly four times the number of computer systems
in fiscal 1994 compared with fiscal 1992, despite having reduced total
worldwide manufacturing capacity. By the end of fiscal 1995, we will be
shipping significantly greater volumes with a manufacturing population
one-half the size of two years ago. 

We are refining our product and service cost structures to reflect the
demands of our customers and the challenges of our competition--while
establishing leadership price/performance across virtually every price band
where we compete. 

These are major accomplishments. Two years into the turnaround, we have laid
the groundwork for our future success. We are succeeding in several of our
businesses, and many of our new products are being well received in the
marketplace. We are adapting the best and most successful business
strategies--honed and proven in the competitive PC, storage, components and
service segments of our business--and applying them on a larger scale across
the company. 

But the question remains: with all that we have going for us, why aren't we
yet leading the industry with the sheer force of our global resources, our
unparalleled products, technology and skills? And why are we not yet
profitable? 

The reality is that despite our progress we still have some critical issues
to address--and that is our mandate for fiscal 1995.

To ensure that decisions made and actions taken will lead to financial
success, we recently made one very important change to Digital's culture and
business: we have cast aside matrix management and instituted clear
accountability for revenue, profits, cash flows and assets within our
business units. We are eliminating the costly infrastructure associated with
the previous management system. The result will be a leaner, more decisive,
more agile company, sharply focused on meeting the needs of customers, the
demands of the marketplace and the challenges of our competitors. 

In today's complex multivendor computing environment, our customers value our
ability to implement and support--directly and through partners--networked
client/ server platforms and applications. We are convincing increasing
numbers of customers that we can link computers worldwide--ours and
others--and keep them working better than anyone else in the business. 

We will conduct our business by a few simple, strategic principles as we move
through our transition to profitability: we will protect our installed base;
we will organize and manage the company to market realities; we will not
compete with our key partners; we will continue to build on our strength of
high-performance networked platforms and engineer all of our products for
network readiness; and we will differentiate Digital throughout the world by
our outstanding global service and support capabilities.

We have done a great deal of work to prepare Digital to return to
profitability and position it for a strong, innovative future. There is more
work to do. And we will do it. My goal for the Company, its stockholders,
employees, customers and partners is to capitalize on that work by restoring
profitability in fiscal year 1995.

Q&A with Robert B. Palmer
Commonly Asked Questions

Below are questions that stockholders and others frequently ask about the 
Company: 

Q: Digital has not been profitable for some time. When can we expect 
   profitability, and what will it take to get there? 

A: We have set an aggressive goal to return to profitability by the end of 
   calendar year 1994. I cannot predict, however, when we will actually 
   return to--and sustain--profitability; much work remains to be done. We 
   must complete the restructuring plans we have announced, achieve a 
   competitive cost structure, increase our penetration of indirect sales 
   channels and build on the successes we have achieved in several areas, 
   including PCs and Alpha AXP systems. 

Q: What are your financial goals? 

A: We are working aggressively to return to sustainable levels of 
   profitability as soon as possible. As an interim goal, we have set a 
   target of maintaining total gross margins (products and services combined)
   in the range of 30 to 32 percent of revenues. This will require a 
   continued focus on manufacturing efficiency and pricing discipline. 
    
   We are targeting spending on research and engineering in the range of 7 
   to 8 percent, and on selling, general and administrative expenses between 
   15 and 18 percent of revenues. These targets will be achieved through 
   successful implementation of our restructuring plan and through greater 
   reliance on indirect channels of distribution. While we do not necessarily
   expect to reach these spending targets for the full fiscal year 1995, we 
   will make significant progress toward them. 

 Q: There have been many rumors that the Company is considering divestments. 
    Can you comment? 

 A: For understandable business reasons, we cannot list what nonstrategic 
    activities or operations the Company might divest in the future, but we
    can talk about our underlying strategic approach. 
     
    As we strive to become more efficient, a critical element of our business 
    strategy is to sharpen our focus on those products and services where we 
    can provide added value to our customers as they choose and implement
    open, networked platforms and servers. Activities that do not support that
    focus are potential candidates for divestiture. 
     
    For example, we recently announced our intention to sell portions of our 
    storage business to a leading storage components manufacturer. The
    segments we are selling--disk and tape drives and thin-film heads
    businesses--have been fast-growing and successful for Digital in the OEM
    (original equipment manufacturer) marketplace, but not central to our
    business. We will continue to provide our customers with high-performance
    storage subsystems that incorporate disk and tape storage products that we
    will source from outside the Company.

Q: What are you doing to improve employee morale and ensure that you keep 
   the talent you need to be successful in the future? 

A: It's natural for people to feel good about their jobs when they can see 
   success and for morale to suffer when the Company is doing poorly. Within 
   businesses that are doing well--Alpha AXP systems, PCs, storage,
   components and peripherals, and customer service are all examples--morale
   is very good. 
    
   The best way to improve the morale of all employees is to return 
   to sustainable profitability as soon as possible. All our efforts are 
   focused on that goal. We need to move through the painful but necessary 
   downsizing as rapidly as we can. We also recognize that compensation must 
   reward performance and instill accountability throughout the organization.


Q: How will you provide the necessary cash for both your restructuring and 
   operating needs? 

A: The funding of our activities through the next phase of Digital's 
   turnaround is a critical challenge for the Company and an important 
   metric for management. We still have one of the lowest debt to total 
   capitalization ratios among the Fortune 50. We have laid out a plan to
   fund our restructuring and operating needs from internal sources. We
   believe this plan is credible and achievable. 
     
   Our accounts receivable DSO (days sales outstanding) and inventory turns 
   performance are not competitive today. If we had merely achieved the 
   performance levels in these two asset categories that we achieved in 
   fiscal 1993, we would have produced an additional $600 million in cash. 
   We have specific plans in place to improve asset management. We also 
   intend to cut capital spending this fiscal year by up to 40 percent 
   compared with last year. Proceeds from divestments will further add to 
   cash, and the Company has arranged for up to $600 million of backup
   liquidity in the form of an accounts receivable securitization facility.

 Q: So where does Digital stand today? 

 A: We have a large and loyal installed base; a substantial--and growing--
    list of partners; a strategy that makes the best use of our strong 
    technology heritage and potential; talented, dedicated and enthusiastic 
    employees; very competitive hardware, software and service offerings; 
    and a balance sheet that enables us to continue to invest in our business 
    while taking necessary restructuring actions. 
  
 The pages that follow outline in detail what we believe are our sustaining
 advantages.

Open Client/Server Computing Advanced Technology for Today's Business 
Needs. 

Helping customers reengineer operations, open new markets and develop 
new products. 

  "Digital's commitment to open client/server computing began with our 
  customers. They told us what they wanted. And we made the investments and 
  alliances needed to make client/server computing something more than just 
  a concept." 

   --Enrico Pesatori, Vice President and General Manager
     Computer Systems Division
     Digital Equipment Corporation 

Many computer companies see client/server computing as the technology that 
links personal computers together in a local area network. 

Digital sees it as much more than that. 

Client/server computing can enable customers to simplify business processes 
to enhance both individual and corporate productivity. 

A client/server environment should be seamless, with no artificial barriers 
to keep people from sharing information and working together. At the same 
time, client/server computing splits applications to enable the 
cost-efficient distribution of computing resources. Client systems-- 
networked PCs, workstations and in some cases large systems--request 
services from other systems throughout the network. 

We're working with customers and strategic partners to take the concept of 
client/server computing and apply it across the entire enterprise to
integrate people, processes, technology and information so everyone and
everything can work together.

This annual report details the products, services and technologies that are 
making client/server computing a reality. It qualifies and quantifies the 
client/server market and highlights the cost savings and productivity gains 
that client/server computing is bringing to Digital customers around the 
world. It gives customers, strategic partners and Digital developers an 
opportunity to share their thoughts about the future. And it explores new 
applications that are creating business opportunities for both Digital and 
its customers.

Leadership in computer technology is not achieved overnight. The industry 
has always been driven by two very different needs. 

First, the need for personal productivity, the need to access data and
process information, a need that was met first by timesharing and later by
personal computers. 

Second, the need for organizational productivity, the need to gather,
organize and process large volumes of data--a need that was met by the
mainframe and later by peer-to-peer networks and clusters of midrange
systems. 

Client/server computing brings these two very different styles of computing
together. 

Digital's contribution was to develop the network platforms, software
frameworks, integration and support services, strategic alliances, and
business practices needed to fully implement the client/server concept.
Working with our strategic partners, we are creating an open, enterprisewide
computing environment to meet the needs of customers seeking to develop a
competitive advantage or maximize the use of existing personnel and computing
resources. 

As a company, we are focusing on our core competencies--the four
prerequisites for leadership in open, multivendor client/server computing: 

 
 Software--The software frameworks customers need to develop client/server
 applications and integrate PC, Macintosh, UNIX, OpenVMS, Windows NT, OSF/1,
 Sun, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and other systems. 

 Systems--Powerful 64- and 32-bit client and server systems based on Alpha
 AXP, VAX and Intel microprocessors with the capacity to handle the huge
 amounts of information inherent in enterprise-wide client/server
 applications. 

 
 Networks--The hardware and software needed to open up the Information
 Superhighway and link clients and servers--switches, routers, hubs, network
 adapters, network operating systems, and mobile/wireless and other
 telecommunications solutions. 
 
 Services--The systems and network integration and multivendor customer
 services needed to plan, design, integrate, implement, manage and maintain
 open multivendor client/server networks that include both legacy systems and
 new technology. 

 These four competencies are interrelated. And--combined with the
 organizational skills needed to develop and implement client/server
 environments--they provide the foundation upon which Digital, its customers
 and its strategic partners can base their future. 
   
"Digital's Components Division delivers world-class products to build open,
networked client/server environments that simplify business processes and
increase productivity. We provide networking hardware, StorageWorks
subsystems, printers, terminals and other components to Digital and other
computer manufacturers, as well as to distributors and resellers." 
  
   --Charles Christ, Vice President and General Manager
     Components Division
     Digital Equipment Corporation 


"If you profess support for open client/server computing, you have to support
multiple operating systems. Digital is fully committed to UNIX, OpenVMS and
Windows NT because they all have a place in client/server environments." 

   --William D. Strecker
     Chief Technical Officer and Vice President
     Advanced Technology Group
     Digital Equipment Corporation 


With open client/server computing, we are helping customers reengineer their
operations, open new markets, develop new products and improve both personal
and corporate productivity.

 Software 
 Frameworks for Open Client/Server Computing

 [Two photographs.  Top photograph of hubs and spokes linked together.  Bottom
 photograph of a man and woman standing near a table on which rests a Digital
 personal computer, the DECpc XL 590.  On and around the table are boxes
 containing Digital's LinkWorks software.] 
   
 Teamwork--Digital, its strategic partners and independent software companies
 have developed more than 6,000 applications for Alpha AXP systems.  Here
 Alexis Cox and Don Harbison of Digital's Software Products Group are pictured
 with Digital's LinkWorks software and the award-winning DECpc XL590.

 "Our next version of OLE COM (the Common Object Model) will support all
 Microsoft platforms and--through our strategic relationship with Digital--
 multivendor systems in open client/server environments." 

 --Jim Allchin, Vice President of Advanced Systems
   Microsoft Corporation 

The idea behind open client/server computing is simple, but its execution is
often difficult. 
 
Client/server environments typically include computers from different
manufacturers, multiple operating systems, multiple databases and multiple
networks. 

Whether you approach client/server computing from an enterprise-wide
perspective or take a departmental or application-specific perspective, you
face a difficult and complex task. 

Fortunately, that task is becoming much easier. The software frameworks for
integrating databases, electronic mail systems, local area networks and
workgroup, production and technical applications across horizontal
multivendor environments are in place together with the industry-standard
"middleware" needed to link those applications. 

The Common Object Model being developed by Digital and Microsoft is an
important component in frameworks and middleware, and in many client/server
applications from Digital software partners. 

The concept behind object-oriented programming is straightforward. "Objects"
are software building blocks--packages of data together with programming that
applies to that data--that can be "linked" to create an application. 

The development of a common model for object-oriented programming for both
personal computers and servers is critical in client/server computing, where
different systems and applications have to work together. Having a common 
model simplifies program development. 

Ad hoc application--for example, searching multiple databases for specific
information--can be created at the desktop by pointing to and clicking on
"objects" on the screen. More complex applications take more work, but
object-oriented programming is a welcome change from having to write line
after line of code. 

The Digital/Microsoft Common Object Model has been called the software
equivalent of Ethernet. Ethernet provides a plug-and-play environment for
linking personal computers and other systems together in local area networks.
The Common Object Model provides a similar plug-and-play environment for
software. 

Roughly one-third of the Fortune 1000 industrial corporations will implement
their first object-oriented applications this year, according to a survey by
Forrester Research, Inc. 

Digital customers like Florida Power & Light, the Rehabilitative Services
Commission and the Spicer Clutch Division of Dana Corporation have blazed the
trail. 

These early adapters have reported a two- to fourfold increase in programmer
productivity while developing new applications to give them an edge over
their competition.

Software 
Teamwork Brings It All Together

[Photograph of hubs and spokes linked together]

"I tell customers interested in open client/server computing to start with
software. If you have the right software, you can support just about any
computer or operating system."
 
 --William R. Demmer, Vice President 
   Software Business Group 
   Digital Equipment Corporation 

"Establishing an information framework does not require a massive overhaul of
existing technology. In fact, Digital LinkWorks software enhances existing
systems by enabling them to become part of an open, enterprise-wide
client/server network." 

 --Robert Staub, President
   VW-GEDAS Group 

VW-GEDAS: How Digital LinkWorks software simplified application development
and user support VW-GEDAS, the systems integration subsidiary of Volkswagen,
provides information-based solutions for both its parent company and
commercial customers. 

Many of these solutions are based on Digital LinkWorks, an "object-oriented"
software framework for Windows applications. With LinkWorks software, files
created on Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Word, Excel and other desktop applications
can be packaged together as a single "object. These "objects"--or clusters of
related information--can be organized and represented as icons. 

This makes it easier for the user to access all the information on a
particular subject without plowing through electronic file cabinets. The
integration of desktop applications with corporate databases makes it easier
for people to find the information they need to do their jobs. And it
simplifies support by eliminating many of the user requests for reports and
data that tie up data processing personnel.

Bank of Montreal: Sharing customer information without compromising 
confidentiality. 
 
Many customers have legitimate concerns about making corporate or customer
data available to employees. Unfortunately, many client/server applications
lack the controls needed to ensure the confidentiality of this data. 

At the same time, data processing managers are concerned about the cost of
developing and implementing client/server applications. Few software programs
come in on-budget and on-schedule because, all too often, there is no
framework around which programmers can develop applications. 

One reason the Bank of Montreal decided to work with Digital in implementing
client/server computing was that Digital could provide the frameworks
required to simplify systems and data management, and messaging, workgroup
and production applications. 
 
Using these frameworks and object-oriented programming, the Bank of Montreal
was able to provide authorized employees with easy access to corporate data
without compromising customer confidentiality. 

"I can't stress strongly enough that this was a business project. We focused
on finding ways to help people work together rather than on technology.
Technology is just the means to an end. Digital understands that."

 --Mike Frow, Vice President
   Bank of Montreal 

Client/Server Growth CIOs in large companies expect the percentage of their
client/server applications to increase from 5 percent in 1992 to 57 percent
by 1995.

Strategy: Intel and Alpha AXP".] 

 <PAGE>

 Alpha AXP systems like the Digital 2100 Alpha AXP server--shown here with
 George Murphy, Andrei Shishov, Rene Martinez and Fidelma Hayes of Digital's
 Systems Business Unit--combine raw speed with the ability to address massive
 databases. 

  "Digital PCs and Alpha AXP systems are complementary. As a technological
 leader in personal, corporate and scientific computing, Digital is uniquely
 positioned to help its customers implement open client/server applications,
 whatever the platform." 

 --Bernhard Auer, Vice President and General Manager
   Personal Computer Business Unit
   Digital Equipment Corporation 

In supporting network and client/server environments, Digital is focusing on
two platforms: high-performance Intel personal computers and servers and
Alpha AXP workstations, servers and systems with the highest performance and
best price/performance in the industry. 

We support both 32-bit Intel and 64-bit Alpha AXP platforms because our
customers need and want both. Buying decisions are based on applications and
the speed with which a system runs those applications. 

A high-speed bus can increase system performance. Digital manufactures and
sells chips that implement the new, industry-standard, high-speed PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus. By building highly reliable personal
computers and servers around this bus--systems that are easy to upgrade and
have high-performance, high-capacity disks--Digital was able to offer
superior price/performance together with a three-year warranty.

Combining technological leadership with comprehensive customer support,
Digital broadened its distribution channels and doubled year-to-year personal
computer sales. 

Today, Digital builds a complete family of high-performance Intel i486 and
Pentium servers, and personal and notebook computers to run the thousands of
applications that have been written for MS-DOS, Windows and Windows NT. 

Applications are also driving the sales of Alpha AXP systems. With more than
6,000 UNIX, OpenVMS and Windows NT applications from independent developers,
we have shipped over one billion dollars' worth of Alpha AXP systems since
the program's launch. 

Digital's Intel and Alpha AXP platforms are complementary. We have the
PC-to-UNIX integration and networking software, the middleware and the
multivendor service organization needed to integrate Intel and Alpha AXP
systems in multivendor networks. 

As more and more customers link PCs and LANs in enterprise-wide networks and
implement client/server applications, the need for faster processing speed
and the ability to hold vast amounts of data in computer memory become
critical. 

A 32-bit system can address only the equivalent of 96 file cabinets. This is
why insurance, credit card, utility, distribution and manufacturing companies
that process huge volumes of transactions and maintain massive databases are
moving applications to 64-bit systems. At the same time, Alpha AXP systems
provide the speed and raw computing power needed to tackle scientific and
imaging applications that used to require multimillion-dollar supercomputers.


While every major manufacturer of microprocessors has announced plans to move
to a 64-bit RISC architecture, Digital is the only company to offer a
complete family of 64-bit microprocessors, computers and operating systems. 

We're also addressing the needs of customers looking for systems to support
mainframe downsizing and current applications with a complete line of Alpha
AXP and VAX systems that support "industrial- strength" OpenVMS software. 

Many of the components and subsystems that account for the superior
performance of Digital's systems are produced by our Components Division.
Digital is a leading supplier of storage subsystems, networking products,
terminals, printers and peripherals to other computer companies, systems
integrators and distributors.

Systems 
For Complex Commercial and Technical Applications

[Photograph of Digital's Alpha AXP chip]
 
"Alpha AXP chips lead the industry in performance, setting a standard in the
open market and building momentum for Digital as a merchant vendor of
microprocessors and PCI peripheral chips." 

 --Ed Caldwell, Vice President, Digital Semiconductor 
   Digital Equipment Corporation

"It is not a question of when you will need 64 bits. It is a question of when
you will need that thirty-third bit. For a lot of applications, that time is
now." 

 --Willy Shih, Vice President
   Product Strategy
   Computer Systems Division
   Digital Equipment Corporation

"You don't just buy technology, you make an investment. And when you invest
you have to look at the long term. You can't afford to buy equipment that
will become obsolete in a matter of years." 

  --Richard C. Zbikowski, Project Manager
    Boston Edison Energy Management Center 

Boston Edison: Alpha AXP systems provide the power for realtime energy
management and control. Few realtime applications are as demanding as energy
management and control. Electric utilities like Boston Edison have to balance
the supply and demand for power. This requires highly reliable realtime
processing and specialized application software. 

In updating its energy management and control system, Boston Edison was
looking for a distributed, workstation-based solution that wouldn't become
obsolete in a matter of years. They wanted an open architecture. 
 
They were one of the first, but by no means the last, major electric utility
to move their energy management and control to Alpha AXP workstations and
computers. In fact, of the 23 large (million-dollar-plus) energy management
and control contracts signed by North American utilities in 1993, 13 of the
wins went to Alpha AXP systems, according to a study by Newton-Evans Research
of Ellicott City, Maryland. In the U.K., Southern Electric, Northern
Electric, Yorkshire Electricity, SEEBOARD, London Electricity and the
National Grid Company have all chosen Alpha AXP systems for major projects. 

Boston Edison chose Alpha AXP systems running UNIX and EMS/SCADA software
over IBM RS6000 AIX systems. In addition to providing Edison with a
price/performance advantage, Digital offered a 64-bit UNIX solution that
supports clusters and multiprocessing while meeting X/Open and other industry
standards. Equally important was the availability of EMS/SCADA realtime
software from CAE Electronics, Ltd., a Digital Technical OEM partner. CAE,
based in Montreal, Canada, is a worldwide leader in the development of power
distribution systems and recently won two contracts to install Alpha AXP
systems in China. 

Boston Edison's Alpha AXP systems form part of a power distribution network
that serves more than 650,000 commercial, residential and industrial
customers.

First Data: How Unix and Alpha AXP technology gave a Digital business partner
a competitive edge in the healthcare field. First Data Corp.'s Health Systems
Group serves some 700 hospitals and healthcare facilities in the U.S. and
international markets. The company designs and markets leading-edge
healthcare technology solutions, including computer-based patient record
applications. Three of their newest customer reference accounts are using
UNIX-based Alpha AXP systems. 

At Georgetown Memorial, Roper and Union Memorial hospitals, these systems are
dramatically reducing the time it takes to run major reports and financial
reconciliations. At Georgetown Memorial, reports that took four to six hours
are now completed in 20 minutes. At Roper Hospital, monthly financial
reporting that took 24 hours is now finished in one to two hours. 

On the strength of this performance, First Data is closing additional Alpha
AXP system sales. With Alpha AXP systems and services, Digital provides First
Data with a robust, industrial-strength UNIX together with the tools needed
to develop and maintain complex client/server and database applications. 

And it is the ability to develop new applications that provides Digital
business partners like First Data with the competitive advantage they need to
succeed in a changing marketplace. 

"Digital has given us what we needed: UNIX that meets industry standards.
Alpha AXP systems that set the standard for performance. And the kind of
support that comes with a true business partnership." 

 --Larry Ferguson, President
   First Data Corp.

How big is 64 bits?

If one bit of information is represented by the smallest printable dot--one
pixel--a square representing 16 bits of information would consist of 65,536
pixels, and would cover an area of about three-quarters of an inch. A square
representing 32 bits would cover an area eighteen by eighteen feet. To
represent 64 bits, 4 billion times larger than 32 bits, an area the size of
Greece, 51,000 square miles, would be required.

Networks
Opening the Information Superhighway

 <PAGE>

Networking no longer means making a choice among competing technologies. The
DEChub MultiSwitch--pictured with Gary Vacon, Rich Graham and Cheryl Galvin
of Digital's Network Product Business--provides a technology-independent
backplane. ATM-ready, the DEChub MultiSwitch supports up to 16 Ethernet,
Token Ring and FDDI plug-in modules. 

"We have a strategic relationship with Digital because we share a common
goal: To make it easier for computer users and computers to work together.
That's why Digital offers NetWare solutions and has incorporated Novell
NetWare into its PATHWORKS network operating system." 

  --Bob Frankenberg, Chairman and CEO
    Novell, Inc.

The Information Superhighway is not a path from Point A to Point B. It is an 
emerging global information utility and commercial trade route that can be
accessed by any computer, anywhere. 

Global access is not a concept developed by a government agency, nor is the
Information Superhighway the creation of a giant corporation. In reality, the
Information Superhighway is the network that is evolving from the interlinked
communications systems that span the world. 

The Internet--an existing network of 21,000 computer networks in 60 countries
that utilizes existing telecommunications links--is a prototype for the
Information Superhighway, giving businesses and individuals a worldwide
electronic mail network and access to remote databases, computer bulletin
boards and applications. 

At the same time, many telecommunications networks are supporting
applications that are opening new markets and creating new business
opportunities--Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), mobile and wireless
communications, multimedia, video-on-demand, on-line transaction processing,
interoffice and intercompany electronic mail, and electronic publishing and
distribution. 

Many of these applications are based on open client/server technology. Take
video-on-demand, for example. The set-top system--the box that will sit on
top of your video set--is the client. The computer system that stores and
transmits a digital video image into your home is the server. 

Digital is working with U S West, NYNEX and USA Video to provide Alpha AXP
servers to implement video-on-demand so television viewers can see the
program or movie they want, when they want it. 

But there's more to the Information Superhighway than the client and server
systems that will use the network. In addition to fiber-optic, coaxial,
wireless and microwave communications, specialized network operating systems,
hubs, bridges, repeaters, routers and high-speed digital switches are needed
to manage traffic and link local and wide area networks together. Then
there's the matter of security, keeping intruders out of your internal
network and protecting confidential and proprietary information. 

Digital is providing hardware as well as networking and security software to 
both corporate customers and communication service providers. We are working
with Australia's Optus Communications to build operational support systems-- 
the network operating, billing and administrative systems needed to control
and manage a fully digital, transcontinental telecommunications network. 

We're providing Alpha AXP systems and high-speed FDDI switches to Glaxo
Research and Development in Stevenage, England, to support growing network
traffic as they develop, test and market new drugs in both Europe and the
Americas. 
 
And we're working with virtually every one of our networking customers to
help them access, move and manage information both within the enterprise and
across the Information Superhighway so they can gain a competitive advantage.

Networks
Stops Along the Highway

[Photograph of busy highway interchange]

"Without networking you wouldn't have open computing environments where
computers work together--where you can exchange ideas and data over the
Internet. Digital builds the switches, routers, hubs and adapters around
which customers can build open networks utilizing ATM, FDDI, Ethernet, Token
Ring and other communications technologies." 

 --Dr. Laurence G. Walker
   Vice President 
   Network Product Business
   Digital Equipment Corporation 

"The Information Superhighway isn't going to mean much unless you have
secondary roads to support local traffic. Here at Iowa State, we're working
with Digital to build the open, high-speed multivendor network needed to
support the academic and research programs of a large university."

  --Dr. George Strawn, Director of the Computation Center
    Iowa State University of Science and Technology 

Iowa State University: Building a science and research infrastructure around 
Alpha AXP systems. The Internet was originally set up to support government
and academic research. It created a "virtual campus" where students and
scientists at one institution could work with their peers, access data and
use computer resources at other institutions around the world. 

Iowa State University of Science and Technology has been part of the Internet
since 1985. Today, working with Digital, the University is developing the
local infrastructure needed to support a multivendor computing environment. 

Using a Digital FDDI network and DECathena software, Iowa State's network now
includes more than 800 client and 50 server workstations located in 45
buildings across the campus. 

Alpha AXP servers are a critical component because the network has to support
projects that involve massive databases. With 64-bit addressing, Iowa State's
Alpha AXP servers can manage databases and perform computations that used to
require mainframes and supercomputers.

Times Mirror: Linking businesses in a citywide multimedia LAN using an
existing cable TV network. In a unique pilot program, Digital, Times Mirror
Cable Television and Arizona State University joined together to provide an
interactive, multimedia commerce network for companies in the Phoenix area. 

Times Mirror Cable Television is providing the infrastructure; Arizona State
University, the demonstration facility and Internet access. Digital Alpha AXP
systems control the network, while a ChannelWorks bridge links existing
computers and LANs together. Digital is also providing the network management
software and services needed to convert the existing cable system into a
two-way interactive, high-speed network to support video, voice and data
applications through-out the metropolitan area. 

By creating an open, broadband network, local businesses are able to work
closely together. For example, McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems and
Allied Signal Engine Division are now able to work with key local suppliers
to dramatically reduce the time it takes to develop and manufacture new
components. 

Times Mirror Cable Television and Digital demonstrated the capabilities of
the Electronic Commerce Network (ECNet) for President Clinton and Vice
President Gore at the White House. 

The network supports concurrent computer-aided design programs where
engineers at prime and sub-contractor sites can view and revise engineering
drawings simultaneously. It supports desktop videoconferencing and "white
boarding" so users at different sites see and annotate the same document at
the same time. 

The Electronic Commerce Network is typical of the new cable services based on
Digital's ChannelWorks technology that are being built in the Americas,
Europe, Asia and the Pacific Rim. 

"While everyone talks about the Information Superhighway, we've built an
on-ramp right here in Phoenix. Local companies are using it to speed product
development and intercompany communications. Large manufacturing companies
and their suppliers are gaining the edge they need to compete in global
markets."

  --Larry W. Wangberg
   President and Chief Executive Officer
   Times Mirror Cable Television and 
   Chairman, National Cable Television Association 

"The really great thing about the Electronic Commerce Network (ECNet) is that
we didn't have to invent whole new technologies to make it work, rather we
integrated well-developed technologies to support new applications so local
businesses could work closely together."

client/server computing." 

  --John Rando, Vice President
    Multivendor Customer Services
    Digital Equipment Corporation 

Practically every computer company sells hardware or software for network and
client/server environments. Most only support the equipment they sell.
Digital is different. We provide the most comprehensive portfolio of systems
and network integration and multivendor customer services in the industry.  

We will take complete responsibility for major projects, from initial
feasibility studies all the way through implementation and management. 

This requires more than just an understanding of technology. Implementing a
new system changes the way people work. That's why--in addition to providing
multivendor systems and network integration--we work closely and have
strategic alliances with independent consultants so together we can address
the business as well as the technical issues facing our customers. 

And, as more and more customers adopt client/server solutions and build
enterprise-wide networks, gaps in service coverage and service quality
inevitably occur. Digital is filling these gaps. We provide multivendor
services, technical systems and network integration services, and customer
training in more than 100 countries to support both local and worldwide
enterprises. 

Today, we are the only service provider prepared to take ownership of all the
support issues found in multivendor environments. We run help desks and train
users. We pull wire and install hardware and software upgrades. And we
provide a full range of system management services including asset management
and remote and on-site performance analysis and tuning. As testimony to our
open client/server support capabilities, Digital won InfoWorld magazine's
1994 award for best client/server technical support. 

Digital supports hardware and software from IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Olivetti,
Apple, Compaq, Sun, Microsoft, WordPerfect, Oracle, NeXT and other companies.
In many cases, hardware and software companies rely on Digital to support
their products. For example, Digital has formal alliances with Dell,
Microsoft, Novell, National Semiconductor, British Telecom (BT) and other
computer, component and telecommunications companies to support their
customers in key markets around the world. 

Professional and multivendor customer services represent a $6-billion-a-year
business for Digital with systems and network integration accounting for more
than one-third of the total. Today, Digital is one of the four largest
systems integration companies in the world and is ranked second by both
International Data Corporation and Computer Reseller News magazine. 

Offering both systems integration and multivendor customer services, Digital 
has all the resources needed to help customers plan, design, implement,
manage, maintain and support open client/server environments around the
world.

Supporting the Customer 24 Hours a Day

[Photograph of several clocks each showing time in a different time

"Our customers are looking for a business partner. They want to deal with a
computer company that can provide systems and network integration and
multivendor services. A company that can help them apply technology in ways
that enhance productivity and protect current and future investments." 

  --Enrico Pesatori, Vice President and General Manager
   Computer Systems Division
   Digital Equipment Corporation 

"Having a service partner who can handle everything from chip swaps to fixing
laser printers is essential to keeping the Society's business running
smoothly on any given day." 

 --Robert Jackson
   Information Technology General Manager
   Yorkshire Building Society 

Yorkshire Building Society: Bringing operational simplicity to a multivendor 
network. The Yorkshire Building Society, with 136 branches throughout the
United Kingdom, faced a problem that is shared by many customers with
multivendor computing environments: Whom do you call when you have a problem?

 
In all too many cases, the source of a problem is not easily identified. Is
it a hardware or a software problem? Is it a problem with the local computer,
with the local area network, or with a laser printer or networked file
server?  It's a problem that's compounded when you have equipment from IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Philips, Olivetti, Dell and other computer manufacturers
running software created by dozens of different companies. 

Yorkshire Building Society found the simple answer: Call Digital. We provide
the multivendor customer services that they need to keep everything running,
in every office. 

Having a single service organization provides operational simplicity while
reducing costs and eliminating the delays that often occur when it's not
clear who owns a particular problem. 

And when many customer branches lack on-site expertise, it is particularly
important that they be able to work with someone they know and trust.

Tokyo Digital Phone:
Building the business support system for a new cellular network

In April 1992, Digital was called in by Tokyo Digital Phone (TDP) and its
partners in the DPG (Digital Phone Group)--CDP (Central DP) and KDP (Kansai
DP)--to build a business support system costing approximately 3 billion yen
($29 million) for a new cellular telephone company entering the highly
competitive Tokyo/Nagoya/Osaka market. 

In April 1994, when the new network went into operation, the business support
system was up and running. 

BACUSS--the Billing and Accounting Customer Support System--is a multivendor,
client/server system that interfaces directly with DPG's switching system to
handle leads, customer orders, customer care, inventory, billing, and account
and agent management. 

TDP and Digital recognized that client/server computing would provide a
competitive advantage because it is scalable and allows the cost-efficient
distribution of computing resources while making information readily
available where and as needed. 

DPG plans to license BACUSS to other cellular telephone companies looking for
a complete customer support system. 

In addition to undertaking major systems integration projects like BACUSS,
Digital provides strategic and operations management services to help its
clients move to and function effectively within client/server environments. 

"We see Digital as a true business partner rather than just a company we
contracted with for specific products and services. And having a close
relationship with the people you do business with is the key to staying
on-schedule and on-budget." 

 --Yosai Hayashi, Managing Director
   Tokyo Digital Phone Co., Ltd.

Teamwork
Digital's Culture and Values
  
[Photograph of front cover of Digital's 1994 Environmental Health & Safety
 Annual Report, showing the globe and captioned Earth Vision]

As individuals and as a company, we have a tradition of achievement in
protecting the environment and in ensuring the health and safety of our
fellow employees. If you'd like a copy of our Environmental, Health and
Safety Annual Report, write to: 

  Digital Equipment Corporation
  Environmental, Health and Safety
  111 Powdermill Road 
  (MSO2-3/B16)
  Maynard, Massachusetts 
  01754-1418

"Technology alone does not guarantee success. The challenge is to apply
technology to the problems facing the customer and the community. As a
company, and as individuals, we welcome that challenge." 

 --Robert B. Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer
   Digital Equipment Corporation 

 
Throughout this annual report, we have focused on the importance of teamwork.
Open client/server computing is not something that we implement by ourselves;
it is a concept that can be implemented only in partnership with others. 

Teamwork is based on trust. That means being honest in dealing with our
customers and business partners as well as with each other. It means respect
for the individual. It means that we are accountable--as individuals and as a
company--for meeting our commitments to our customers and business partners. 

These core values create an environment that encourages innovation and
involvement. Digital is recognized as a leader in the development of managed
healthcare programs for its employees. And Digital was one of the first
companies in the country to establish an HIV/AIDS program office to educate
its employees. 

We recognize our responsibility for the environment. We eliminated CFCs and
other ozone-depleting substances from our products, processes and services.
We introduced energy-efficient PCs. And we integrated environmental
compatibility features into our new video terminals and have a program to
extend environmental compatibility to other products, media, documentation
and packaging. 

These are not isolated activities. In every country where we do business, we 
try to make a difference. Digital employees volunteer their time and skills
to schools, hospitals and other community organizations. At the same time,
the company has a formal Corporate Contributions Program as well as an
External Research Program that supports projects at 125 colleges and
universities around the world. 

We believe that computer technology can help make this a better world, and
that as individuals and as a company we have a contribution to make.

Revenues 

In fiscal 1994, total operating revenues, which were $13.5 billion, declined
by $921 million or 6%, following an increase of $440 million or 3% in fiscal
1993 and an increase of $20 million, or less than 1% in fiscal 1992.

Non-U.S. revenues accounted for 62% of total operating revenues in fiscal
1994, down from 64% in fiscal 1993 and 63% in fiscal 1992. European revenues
declined to $5.9 billion in fiscal 1994, down from $7 billion and $6.8
billion in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. The decline in fiscal 1994
European revenues was due principally to weak demand for the Corporation's
products and services in that region, exacerbated by the difficulties
associated with the Digital-Kienzle business acquired in 1991 (see Note J)
and negative effects of foreign currency fluctuations, discussed below.

Product sales for fiscal 1994 were $7.2 billion, or 53% of total operating
revenues, compared with $7.6 billion, or 53% of revenues, and $7.7 billion,
or 55% of revenues in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. While the
Corporation shipped substantially more computer systems in fiscal 1994 than
in the previous fiscal year, product sales for fiscal 1994 declined compared
with the prior two years, due principally to a continued shift in the mix of
product sales toward low-end, lower-priced computer systems and away from the
Corporation's proprietary mid-range products.

In fiscal 1994, the Corporation experienced substantial growth in demand for
Alpha AXP-based systems, particularly workstations, and for Intel-based
personal computer products, as well as certain storage and component
products. Alpha AXP systems revenue represented approximately 13% of fiscal
1994 product sales, up from 3% for fiscal 1993. Revenues from the sale of
Intel-based personal computers represented 19% of fiscal 1994 product sales,
up from 9% for fiscal 1993. VAX systems revenues declined from 34% of product
sales in fiscal 1993 to 19% in fiscal 1994, as the Corporation is in the
midst of a major product transition. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994,
revenues from the sale of Alpha AXP systems exceeded revenues from the sale
of VAX systems for the first time.

In fiscal 1994, service and other revenues totaled $6.3 billion, or 47% of
total operating revenues, compared with $6.8 billion, or 47% of total
operating revenues, and $6.2 billion, or 45% of total operating revenues, for
fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. Service revenues declined by $524 million
or 8% in fiscal 1994, following increases of 9% and 11% in fiscal 1993 and
1992, respectively.

The decline in service revenues for fiscal 1994 was due to several factors,
including lower levels of revenue from the Corporation's VAX systems
maintenance business, greater reliability of and lower maintenance revenue
associated with the Corporation's newer, lower-priced products, and increased
competition in the maintenance business. In addition, revenues from systems
integration and consulting services were essentially unchanged from fiscal
1993, as the Corporation became more selective in pursuing systems
integration and other consulting opportunities. Service revenue associated
with the maintenance of other vendors' products grew in fiscal 1994,
partially offsetting the declines noted above. The Corporation expects the
market trends affecting service revenues from maintenance of VAX systems to
continue over the next year.

Movements in currency exchange rates are one of many competitive, industry
and economic factors which affect the Corporation's operating results. The
Corporation does business in more than 100 countries in major and emerging
markets. Revenues and costs in non-U.S. operations, including certain product
costs, are denominated in applicable local currencies. While the effects of
foreign currency translation for a fiscal period are included in applicable
revenue and expense categories, they are difficult to quantify precisely
because the Corporation responds to movements in currency exchange rates
through pricing, expense, sourcing or other management actions, as market
conditions permit. During fiscal 1994 and prior periods, the Corporation
entered into foreign exchange contracts covering most of its net monetary
assets, liabilities and firm commitments, with maturities which generally did
not exceed six months, to increase the predictability of the rate at which
non-U.S. revenues were translated into U.S. dollars. During fiscal 1994, the
net effect of foreign currency translation and gains and losses on foreign
exchange contracts was negative compared with fiscal 1993, whereas the net
effect in fiscal 1993 compared with fiscal 1992 was positive. (See Notes A
and I.)

Expenses and Profit Margins

The Corporation's total gross margin for fiscal 1994 was 34% of total
operating revenues, compared with 40% of total operating revenues in fiscal
1993 and 42% of total operating revenues in fiscal 1992.

The Corporation's gross margin on fiscal 1994 product sales was 31% of
product sales, compared with 41% of product sales and 45% of product sales
for fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. The decline in product gross margin
was due to several factors, including pricing, a continued shift in the
Corporation's mix of product sales toward low-end systems, which typically
carry lower margins, and a business model shift toward greater use of
indirect channels of distribution.

Recognizing these competitive conditions and the need to lower manufacturing
costs, the Corporation closed several manufacturing plants in fiscal 1994,
and recently announced the closure of three more plants in fiscal 1995. The
Corporation has implemented and will continue to refine organizational
changes intended to increase accountability in order to improve profitability
and facilitate the design and manufacture of products for volume markets.

Gross margin on service revenues for fiscal 1994 was 37% of service revenues,
compared with 39% of service revenues and 38% of service revenues in fiscal
1993 and 1992, respectively. The two percentage point decline in service
gross margin was due to a decline in revenue from the Corporation's
higher-margin systems maintenance business, as described above.

Research and engineering (R&E) spending for fiscal 1994 totaled $1.3 billion
(10% of total operating revenues), compared with $1.5 billion (11% of total
operating revenues) in fiscal 1993 and $1.8 billion (13% of total operating
revenues) in fiscal 1992. The decrease in R&E expenses was due to several
factors, including ongoing actions to eliminate redundant engineering efforts
and streamline product offerings, which resulted in a reduction in employee
population. The Corporation's R&E investment program is focused on
maintaining a strong, consistently market-driven product set and on attaining
and sustaining technology leadership in selected areas.

Fiscal 1994 selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $4.0
billion (30% of total operating revenues) compared with $4.4 billion (31% of
total operating revenues) and $4.7 billion (34% of total operating revenues)
for fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal
1994 were $310 million of non-cash write-offs and write-downs associated with
intangible assets. (See Note J.) The decrease in SG&A expenses in fiscal 1994
was due principally to reductions in employee population, as well as
reductions in other overhead costs.

While expenses continue to decline, the Corporation's cost structure is still
too high for the level and mix of total operating revenues. As a result, at
the end of fiscal 1994 the Corporation approved additional restructuring
actions.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994,the Corporation accrued restructuring
costs of $1.2 billion to cover actions taken in the fourth quarter and
planned actions for fiscal 1995 and 1996. Approximately $679 million of this
charge was to cover the cost of employee separations to be completed by the
end of fiscal 1995. The remaining $527 million was for facility closures and
related costs. The cost of employee separations includes termination benefits
for approximately 20,000 employees. A portion of these employee separations
occurred near the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 and the remainder
will occur by the end of fiscal 1995. These employees are located principally
in the United States and Europe.

Planned restructuring actions for fiscal 1995 include employee separations
across most organizations and functions, with approximately 40% to come from
sales and marketing, as the Corporation sells more products and services
through indirect channels of distribution. The planned facility closures
cover 10 million square feet of office and manufacturing space, principally
in the United States and Europe. Cash expenditures associated with these
restructuring actions are expected to be approximately $580 million in the
first half of fiscal 1995, $420 million for the remainder of fiscal 1995 and
$240 million related to facility closures beyond fiscal 1995. These actions
do not include workforce or facility reductions that may result from
divestments.

See Note E for a description of the Corporation's restructuring actions and
related costs.

As a result of actions associated with restructuring charges to operations in
fiscal 1992, 1991 and 1990, the Corporation has eliminated an estimated $2.8
billion of annualized operating expenses, including approximately $2.5
billion of annual cash expense related to workforce reductions and
approximately $335 million related to facility operating costs. When
completed, the actions associated with the restructuring charge in fiscal
1994 are expected to result in the elimination of additional annualized
operating expenses of approximately $1.8 billion, including $1.5 billion of
cash expense.

Total employee population decreased by 11,400 during fiscal 1994. The
Corporation had approximately 77,800, 89,900 and 107,900 regular employees at
the end of fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and an additional 5,000,
4,300 and 5,900 temporary and contract workers at the end of fiscal 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Interest income in fiscal 1994 decreased to $49 million from $64 million in
fiscal 1993 and $96 million in fiscal 1992, reflecting lower interest rates
and lower average cash balances. Interest expense increased to $73 million
from $51 million in fiscal 1993 and $39 million in fiscal 1992. The increase
in fiscal 1994 interest expense was due principally to the full year's
interest expense on $1 billion of long-term debt issued during fiscal 1993.
Interest expense for fiscal 1994 included the differential received on
interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of fiscal
1994, relating to $750 million of long-term debt.

In fiscal 1994, the Corporation's income tax expense was $85 million on a
pre-tax loss of $2.0 billion. (See Note C.)  In fiscal 1993, the
Corporation's income tax expense was $27 million on a pre-tax loss of $224
million. Income tax expense reflects several factors, including income taxes
provided for profitable non-U.S. operations and an inability to recognize
currently U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax benefits from operating losses. In
addition, fiscal 1994 income tax expense includes a $70 million reduction in
net deferred tax assets associated with non-U.S. operations.

The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes, effective July 4, 1993. The Corporation
had previously accounted for income taxes under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 11. In the first quarter of fiscal year 1994, the Corporation
recorded a one-time benefit of $20 million, or $.14 per share, for the
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. There is no cash flow
impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 109. The standard was adopted on a
prospective basis and amounts presented for prior years were not restated.
(See Note C.)

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 112 -
Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, effective as of the
beginning of the fiscal year. SFAS No. 112 requires accrual accounting of
benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. These benefits include, but are not limited to, salary
continuation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits,
disability-related benefits, and continuation of benefits such as health care
benefits and life insurance coverage. The cumulative effect of adopting this
standard resulted in a one-time charge to income of $71 million (the
"transition obligation"), or $.51 per common share. This transition
obligation represents principally the cost of providing medical, dental and
life insurance benefits to individuals in the U.S. currently on long-term
disability during the estimated remaining period in which they will receive
disability benefits. The annual expense under the new standard, exclusive of
the transition obligation, is not significantly different than the annual
expense under the Corporation's former practice. There is no cash flow impact
from the adoption of SFAS No. 112. The first quarter of fiscal 1994 has been
restated to reflect the change in accounting principle. (See Supplementary
Information, Quarterly Financial Data.) Prior years' consolidated financial
statements have not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 112.

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
115 - Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. SFAS
No. 115 expands the use of fair value accounting for certain debt and equity
securities. The Corporation will adopt SFAS No. 115 in the first quarter of
fiscal 1995. At the end of fiscal 1994, the Corporation had unrecognized
gains on long-term investments of approximately $65 million that would be
subject to SFAS No. 115 treatment.

for Operations

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion
at the end of fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Net cash used by operating activities was $375 million in fiscal 1994,
compared with net cash generated of $47 million and $431 million in fiscal
1993 and 1992, respectively. The $375 million net use of cash from operating
activities in fiscal 1994 was due principally to restructuring activities,
the net loss for the year and increased inventory levels in support of
increased demand for Alpha AXP, personal computer and certain storage
products. Net cash generated by operating activities in fiscal 1993 was
principally the result of improved accounts receivable, offset by
expenditures for restructuring activities, the net loss for the year and
decreased accounts payable.

Net cash used for investing activities was $626 million, $884 million and
$981 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Capital
expenditures totaled $682 million in fiscal 1994, compared with $529 million
and $710 million in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. Capital expenditures
in fiscal 1994 included $206 million toward the construction of and purchase
of equipment for a new semiconductor fabrication facility in Hudson,
Massachusetts. This project has a currently estimated total cost of $425
million. Approximately $54 million of the remaining $91 million of unexpended
costs on the Hudson project is expected to be spent in fiscal 1995. The
Corporation expects total capital expenditures in fiscal 1995 to be less than
$500 million.

The Corporation disposed of property, plant and equipment and other assets in
fiscal 1994, generating approximately $121 million in cash proceeds, compared
with $68 million and $15 million in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively,
principally as a result of restructuring activities. Subsequent to the end of
the fiscal year, the Corporation and Quantum Corporation ("Quantum") signed
an agreement providing for Quantum's purchase of a portion of the
Corporation's storage business for $400 million. (See Note M.) The
Corporation also sold its shares of the common stock of Ing. Olivetti & C.
S.p.A. subsequent to the end of fiscal 1994 for approximately $148 million in
cash. (See Note J.)

Net cash generated from financing activities was $538 million and $1.1
billion in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively, and net cash used was $36
million in fiscal 1992. The  principal financing activity in fiscal 1994 was
the issuance and sale of preferred stock, as discussed below, generating net
proceeds of $387 million. The Corporation also received $150 million during
fiscal 1994 from the issuance of common stock under the Corporation's stock
plans, compared with $196 million and $232 million in fiscal 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

On January 21, 1994, the Corporation filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, covering the registration of debt securities,
preferred stock, depositary shares, and warrants to purchase equity and debt
securities, in an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. In March 1994, the
Corporation issued and sold 16,000,000 Depositary Shares under the shelf
registration statement, each representing a one-fourth interest in a share of
the Corporation's Series A 8 7/8% Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series A
Preferred Stock"), par value $1.00 per share. Dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock accrue at the annual rate of 8 7/8% (approximately $36
million in the aggregate). The Corporation paid approximately $2 million in
dividends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994. In addition, prior to the end
of fiscal 1994, the Corporation's  Board of Directors declared a quarterly
dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock (totaling approximately $9
million), which was paid on July 15, 1994. (See Note L.)

Total long-term debt was $1.0 billion at the end of fiscal 1994 and fiscal
1993 and $91 million at the end of fiscal 1992. At the end of fiscal 1994,
substantially all of the Corporation's available lines of credit were unused,
including a three-year $750 million committed credit facility. Shortly after
the end of the fiscal year, the Corporation terminated its credit facility,
having replaced it as a source of liquidity with an accounts receivable
securitization facility. (See Note F.)

Availability of Funds to Support Current and Future Operations and Spending
for Operations (continued)

The Corporation estimates that $1.0 billion of cash will be expended on
planned restructuring activities in fiscal 1995, and an additional $240
million beyond fiscal 1995. The Corporation intends to fund planned
restructuring activities from operations, asset management efforts and
existing cash, although if required, additional sources of cash are expected
to be available, as discussed above.

The Corporation's need for, cost of and access to funds are dependent on
future operating results, as well as conditions external to the Corporation.
The Corporation historically has maintained a conservative capital structure,
and believes that its current cash position and its sources of and access to
capital are adequate to support planned restructuring actions and operations.

Report of Management

The Corporation's management is responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and for the integrity of all the financial data included in this
annual report. In preparing the financial statements, management makes
informed judgments and estimates of the expected effects of events and
transactions that are currently being reported.

Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with management's
policies for conducting its business. This system includes policies which
require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all laws
to which the Corporation is subject. The internal controls process is
continuously monitored by direct management review and an internal audit
program under which periodic independent reviews are made.

The Corporation's independent public accountants annually review the
accounting and control systems of the Corporation. Their audit includes a
review of the internal control structure to the extent they consider
necessary and selective tests of transactions to support their report.

The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, which is composed of
four Board members who are independent of management, is responsible for
determining that management fulfills its responsibility with respect to the
Corporation's financial statements and the system of internal accounting
controls.

The Audit Committee meets regularly with representatives of management, the
independent accountants and the Corporation's internal auditors to review
audits, financial reporting and internal control matters, and when
appropriate, meets with the Corporation's outside counsel on relevant
matters. The independent accountants and the internal auditors have full and
free access to the Audit Committee and regularly meet privately with the
Audit Committee.

Coopers & Lybrand, independent accountants, have been engaged by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors, with the approval of the stockholders,
to audit the Corporation's financial statements. Their report follows.

To The Stockholders and Directors, Digital Equipment Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digital
Equipment Corporation as of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended July 2, 1994. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Digital
Equipment Corporation as of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended July 2, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note G to the consolidated financial statements, the
Corporation changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions in fiscal 1992.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note A - Significant Accounting Policies
___________________________________________________________________________

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the
Corporation include the financial statements of the parent and its U.S. and
non-U.S. subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and profits have been
eliminated. Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassifed to conform
with current year presentation.

Fiscal Year - The fiscal year of the Corporation is the
fifty-two/fifty-three week period ending the Saturday nearest the last day
of June. The fiscal years ended July 2, 1994 and June 27, 1992 included 52
weeks. The fiscal year ended July 3, 1993 included 53 weeks.

Translation of Foreign Currencies - For non-U.S. operations, the U.S.
dollar is the functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities of
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange
rates. Nonmonetary assets such as inventories and property, plant and
equipment are translated at historical rates. Income and expense items are
translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year, except that
inventories and depreciation charged to operations are translated at
historical rates. Exchange gains and losses arising from translation are
included in current income.

The Corporation enters into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to
hedge the impact of exchange rate movements on operations and the asset and
liability positions of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The impact of exchange rate
movements on contracts used to hedge transactions is included in income when
the operating revenues and expenses are recognized and, for contracts used
to hedge assets and liabilities, in the period in which the exchange rates
change. The cash flows related to these contracts are classified in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as part of cash flows from operating
activities. See Note I for information on the Corporation's foreign exchange
contracts.

Revenue Recognition - Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time
the product is shipped. Service and other revenues are recognized ratably
over the contractual period or as the services are performed.

Warranty - Warranty revenues are recognized ratably over the warranty
period; warranty-related costs are recognized as service expense is
incurred. The Corporation also provides warranty coverage as a product
attribute on certain products. Estimated costs to repair such products are
accrued as product cost when the product is shipped.

Net Income/(Loss) Applicable per Common Share - Per common share amounts
are calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares and
common share equivalents outstanding during periods of net income, after
deducting applicable preferred stock dividends. Common share equivalents are
attributable to stock options. Per share amounts are calculated based only
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during periods
of net loss, after deducting applicable preferred stock dividends.

Cash Equivalents - The Corporation considers all highly liquid temporary
cash investments with maturities of three months or less at date of
acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at cost plus
accrued interest, which approximates market.

Taxes - In general, the Corporation's practice is to reinvest the earnings
of its foreign subsidiaries in those operations, and repatriation of
retained earnings is done only when it is advantageous to do so. Applicable
taxes are provided only on amounts planned to be remitted. 

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market.

 Note A - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 ___________________________________________________________________

 Depreciation expense is computed principally on the following bases:

 Classification         Depreciation Lives and Methods
 __________________________________________________________
 Buildings              33 years (straight-line)

 Leasehold              Life of assets or term of lease,
 Improvements           whichever is shorter (straight-line)

 Machinery and
 Equipment              3 to 10 years (accelerated methods)
 __________________________________________________________

When assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses
resulting from restructuring actions are included in accrued restructuring
costs. Other resulting gains and losses are included in income.

Other Assets - Other assets include equity investments, capitalized software
development costs, goodwill, deferred taxes and other intangible assets.

Software development costs are capitalized beginning at the time that
technical feasibility is established. These costs are amortized over three
years from the date the products are available for general use.

Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the asset, subject to periodic review of realizability.

Other intangible assets are amortized using unit-volume and straight-line
methods, as applicable, over their estimated useful lives, subject to
periodic review of realizability.


Note B  Geographic Operations
__________________________________________________________________________

Industry - The Corporation operates in one business segment: the design,
manufacture, sale and service of networked computer systems.

Non-U.S. Operations - Sales and marketing operations outside the United
States are conducted principally through sales subsidiaries in Canada,
Europe, Central and South America, Asia and the Pacific Rim; by direct
sales from the parent corporation and through various representative
distributorship arrangements and value-added resellers. The Corporation's
non-U.S. manufacturing operations include plants in the Americas, Europe,
Asia and the Pacific Rim. The products of these manufacturing plants are
sold to the Corporation's sales subsidiaries, the parent corporation or
other manufacturing plants for further processing.

Intercompany transfers between geographic areas are accounted for at prices
which are intended to be representative of unaffiliated party transactions.

Sales to unaffiliated customers outside the United States, including U.S.
export sales, were $8.3 billion, $9.2 billion, and $8.8 billion for the
fiscal years ended July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992,
respectively, which represented 62%, 64% and 63%, respectively, of total
operating revenues. Where applicable, the retained earnings of
substantially all of the Corporation's international subsidiaries have been
reinvested to support operations. These accumulated retained earnings,
before elimination of intercompany transactions, aggregated $2.9 billion,
$4.0 billion and $3.6 billion at July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993 and June 27,
1992, respectively.

The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes, effective July 4, 1993. The
Corporation had previously accounted for income taxes under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 11. In the first quarter of fiscal year 1994,
the Corporation recorded a one-time benefit of $20,000,000 or $.14 per common
share, for the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. There is
no cash flow impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 109. The standard was
adopted on a prospective basis and amounts presented for prior years were not
restated.

 </TABLE>


The gross deferred tax asset from tax loss carryforwards of $1.4 billion
represents $3.7 billion of net operating loss carryforwards on a tax return
basis which will generally expire as follows: $200,000,000 in 1998,
$350,000,000 in 1999, $1.2 billion in 2007, $500,000,000 in 2008,
$600,000,000 in 2009, and the remainder thereafter.

Tax credit carryforwards will generally expire as follows:  $40,000,000 in
2001, $50,000,000 in 2002, $50,000,000 in 2003, and the remainder thereafter.

Major changes in the components of temporary differences and carryforwards
for the period ended July 2, 1994 include increases in gross deferred tax
assets relating to restructuring, tax loss carryforwards and intangibles in
the amounts of $211,938,000, $399,725,000 and $106,368,000, respectively.

For the period ended July 2, 1994, the total valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets increased $872,887,000. The increase in the valuation allowance
resulted from increased gross deferred tax assets associated with tax loss
carryforwards, restructuring and other deferred tax assets.

Gross deferred taxes were increased by $32,410,000 as a result of statutory
tax rate changes, fully offset by valuation allowances.

Fiscal year 1994 income tax expense includes a $70,000,000 reduction in net
deferred tax assets associated with non-U.S. operations.

In connection with its normal examination of the Corporation's 1989, 1990 and
1991 tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service has proposed adjustments. The
Corporation believes its judgments in these matters have been appropriate and
any adjustments which might result would not have a material effect on the
financial statements.

In fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, income taxes paid were approximately
$42,419,000, $53,889,000 and $144,620,000, respectively.

See Note A for further explanation of the Corporation's income tax accounting
policies.




Note D - Capitalized Computer Software Development Costs
_____________________________________________________________________________

Unamortized computer software development costs were $124,780,000 and
$138,024,000 at July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, respectively. Amortization
expense was $67,515,000, $68,978,000 and $63,956,000 for the years ended July
2, 1994, July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, respectively. Accumulated
amortization was $208,837,000 and $168,845,000 at July 2, 1994 and July 3,
1993, respectively.


Note E - Restructuring Actions
____________________________________________________________________________

Accrued restructuring costs and charges include the cost of involuntary
employee termination benefits, facility closures and related costs
associated with restructuring actions. Employee termination benefits include
severance, wage continuation, notice pay, medical and other benefits.
Facility closures and related costs include gains and losses on disposal of
property, plant and equipment, lease payments and related costs.

Restructuring costs are accrued and charged to expense in accordance with an
approved management plan, supported by an appropriate level of specificity
for the planned actions. Actual restructuring costs are recognized as a
reduction in the accrued liability in the period incurred.

While expenses continue to decline, the Corporation's cost structure is still
too high for the level and mix of total operating revenues. As a result, at
the end of fiscal year 1994, the Corporation approved additional restructuring 
actions and accrued related costs of $1.2 billion. Cash expenditures associated 
with these actions are expected to be approximately $580,000,000 in the first 
half of fiscal 1995, $420,000,000 in the second half of fiscal 1995 and 
$240,000,000 related to facility closures beyond fiscal 1995. These actions do 
not include workforce or facility reductions that may result from divestments.

The cost of employee separations associated with the fiscal year 1994 charge
includes termination benefits for approximately 20,000 employees. A portion
of these employee separations occurred near the end of the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1994 and the remainder will occur in fiscal 1995. These employees are
located principally in the U.S. and Europe. The greatest portion of employee
separations, approximately 40%, are expected to come from sales and marketing
functions, as the Corporation sells more products through indirect channels
of distribution. Most other organizations and functions also will be affected
by the planned reduction in employees. The fiscal 1994 charge also covers
costs associated with closure of 10 million square feet of facilities,
including office and manufacturing space, principally in the U.S. and Europe.

Restructuring actions have resulted in termination of approximately 12,000,
17,000 and 10,000 employees in fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

 At the end of fiscal year 1992, having fully utilized the balance of
 restructuring costs accrued at the end of fiscal 1991 and in response to an
 unanticipated decline in product sales during the second half of fiscal 1992
 and resulting operating losses, additional restructuring plans were
 formulated. These actions resulted in the accrual of $1.5 billion of
 restructuring costs.

Principal payments during the next five fiscal years are as follows:
1995 - $2,984,000; 1996 - $5,416,000; 1997 - $5,648,000; 1998 - $256,266,000;
1999 - $935,000. 

In fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, interest paid was $76,203,000,
$37,123,000 and $43,494,000, respectively.

Based primarily on dealer quotes, the fair value of long-term borrowings,
including current maturities, was approximately $834,000,000 and $1.1 billion
at July 2,1994 and July 3,1993, respectively.

The Corporation has entered into interest rate swap agreements which
effectively convert a portion of the long-term debt from fixed to variable
rates. As of July 2, 1994, the net face amount of interest rate swaps
outstanding was $1.3 billion, of which a net $750,000,000 was subject to
variable rates as a result of offsetting positions. Based on dealer quotes,
the fair value of such agreements, which represents the replacement value,
was a net payable of $42,800,000 at July 2, 1994. There were no interest rate
swaps in effect at July 3,1993.

The Corporation had available lines of credit totaling $1.2 billion for
fiscal years ended July 2,1994 and July 3,1993. Included in these lines of
credit was a $750,000,000 committed credit facility which was terminated by
the Corporation on July 25,1994, having been replaced as a source of
liquidity with an accounts receivable securitization facility as described
below. Substantially all of these lines of credit were unused at the end of
fiscal 1994 and 1993. Except for the $750,000,000 credit facility, which was
subject to an annual facility fee of 0.25%, commitment fees on the unused
lines of credit were neither material nor significant.

In addition to available lines of credit, in June 1994, the Corporation
entered into a five-year agreement with a major financial institution (i)
providing for the transfer and sale by the Corporation to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Corporation of a designated pool of domestic trade accounts
receivable (the "Receivables") and (ii) allowing the Corporation to sell to
a group of investors an undivided ownership interest in the Receivables for
proceeds of up to $600,000,000 (the "Purchase Limit"). The agreement includes
annual program fees totaling 0.2% of the Purchase Limit. As of July 2, 1994,
the entire $600,000,000 was available to the Corporation; however, no
interests in the Receivables had been sold.


Note G - Postretirement and Other Postemployment Benefits
_____________________________________________________________________________

Pension Plans - The Corporation and its subsidiaries have defined benefit and
defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all employees. The
benefits are based on years of service and compensation during the employee's
career. Pension cost is based on estimated benefit payment formulas. It is
the Corporation's policy to make tax-deductible contributions to the plans in
accordance with local laws. Contributions are intended to provide not only
for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.  For the U.S. pension plan, there were no contributions
in the fiscal years 1994, 1993 or 1992  due to the full funding limit of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. The assets of the plans include
corporate equity and debt securities, government securities and real estate.

The Corporation's fiscal year 1994 pension cost, before curtailment gains,
declined, reflecting the positive effects of restructuring activities and a
change in future discretionary plan improvements. The net periodic pension
cost for defined contribution pension plans was $12,585,000, $7,944,000 and
$11,202,000 for the fiscal years ended July 2,1994, July 3,1993 and June 27,
1992, respectively. The measurement dates for all plans were within 90 days
of year-end. The Corporation recognized a one-time charge of $161,658,000 in
fiscal 1992 for special early retirement pension benefits as a component of
restructuring costs.

Note G - Postretirement and Other Postemployment Benefits (continued)
____________________________________________________________________________

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions - The Corporation has defined
benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits for
U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. Substantially all of the
Corporation's U.S. employees may become eligible for postretirement benefits
if they reach retirement age while working for the Corporation. The majority
of the Corporation's non-U.S. subsidiaries do not offer postretirement
benefits other than pensions to retirees.

The Corporation's postretirement benefits plans other than pensions are
funded as costs are incurred. Fiscal year 1993 expense reflects a reduction
from the prior year resulting from cost sharing changes. Retiree
contributions for the U.S. medical plan are based on length of service for
employees retiring after fiscal 1993.

The Corporation also recognized a one-time charge of $142,985,000 in fiscal
year 1992 for special early postretirement benefits other than pensions as a
component of restructuring costs.

The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
- - Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions in
fiscal year 1992 and elected to recognize the cumulative effect immediately
for its U.S. and material non-U.S. plans, which resulted in a charge of
$485,495,000, net of tax benefits of $4,188,000, to fiscal year 1992
results.

Postemployment Benefits - In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994, the
Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
112 - Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, effective as of the
beginning of the fiscal year. This standard requires the accrual of benefits
provided to former or inactive employees, after employment but before
retirement. These benefits include, but are not limited to, salary
continuation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits,
disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits such as health care
and life insurance coverage.

The cumulative effect of adopting this standard resulted in a one-time
charge to income of $71,068,000 (the "transition obligation"), or $.51 per
common share. This transition obligation represents principally the cost of
providing medical, dental and life insurance benefits to individuals in the
U.S. currently on long-term disability, during the estimated remaining
period in which they will receive disability benefits. The annual expense
under the new standard, exclusive of the transition obligation, is not
significantly different than the annual expense under the Corporation's
former practice. There is no cash flow impact from the adoption of SFAS No.
112. The first quarter of fiscal year 1994 has been restated to reflect the
change in accounting principle. Prior years' consolidated financial
statements have not been restated to reflect this change.

and June 27, 1992 amounted to $436,080,000, $503,094,000 and $544,811,000,
respectively.

Litigation - During the fourth quarter, the Corporation was named as a
defendant in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. District
Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging violations of the Federal
securities laws arising from alleged misrepresentations and omissions in
connection with the Corporation's issuance and sale of Series A 8 7/8%
Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and the
Corporation's financial results for the quarter ended April 2, 1994. The
Corporation's directors, certain of its officers and the managing
underwriters of the Corporation's Series A Preferred Stock offering were also
named as defendants in certain of the actions. Plaintiffs alternatively seek
unspecified monetary damages or rescission of their purchase of the Series A
Preferred Stock. The Corporation believes that the claims asserted are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims.

 
Note I - Other Financial Instruments
____________________________________________________________________________
  
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk - The Corporation enters into foreign exchange option
and forward contracts on a continuing basis for periods consistent with its
committed exposures to limit potential losses from adverse exchange rate
movements on operations and to delay the short-term impact of foreign
currency movements on asset and liability positions of non-U.S. subsidiaries.
The foreign exchange option and forward contracts generally have maturities
which do not exceed three months and six months, respectively. The
Corporation does not anticipate any material adverse effect due to exchange
rate movements over the short-term period covered by these contracts. The
Corporation does not engage in speculation. See Note A for information on the
Corporation's accounting policy on foreign exchange.
   
As of July 2, 1994, the net face amount of foreign exchange option contracts
outstanding, substantially all of which were in European currencies, was
$363,000,000. Based on dealer quotes, the fair value of such contracts was a
net receivable of $2,000,000 at July 2, 1994. There were no foreign exchange
option contracts in effect prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994.
   
As of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, the net face amount of foreign exchange
forward contracts outstanding, substantially all of which were in European
currencies, was $558,000,000 and $1.1 billion, respectively. Based on dealer
quotes, the fair value of such contracts, which represents the replacement
value, was a net payable of $46,000,000 at July 2, 1994 and a net receivable
of $14,400,000 at July 3, 1993.
  
Fair Value - The fair value of cash equivalents, debt, foreign exchange
contracts and investments is disclosed in relevant notes to the financial
statements. For all other financial instruments, the carrying amount
approximates fair value.
   
Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Corporation to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of temporary cash investments and trade receivables.
   
The Corporation places its temporary cash investments with high credit
qualified financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers
comprising the Corporation's customer base, and their dispersion across many
different industries and geographies.
   
As of July 2, 1994, the Corporation had no significant concentrations of
credit risk.
  
Note J - Investing Activities
___________________________________________________________________________ 
 
In June 1992, the Corporation entered into agreements to purchase common
stock of Ing. Olivetti & C. S.p.A. ("Olivetti") and to form a strategic
alliance with Olivetti. Pursuant to these agreements, as amended, the
Corporation purchased a total of 98,533,000 shares of Olivetti common stock
in fiscal year 1993 for a total investment of approximately $287,800,000. As
part of the alliance agreement, as amended, Olivetti has agreed to purchase a
minimum level of Alpha AXP products from the Corporation over a specified
period of time.
  
The Olivetti stock is recorded at $83,800,000. The remainder of the purchase
price was recorded as an intangible asset to be amortized over a period not
to exceed ten years. While the Corporation expects to generate significant
revenues from the sale of Alpha AXP products to Olivetti in the long term, in
fiscal year 1994, the sale of Alpha AXP products to Olivetti fell
significantly short of levels called for in the alliance agreement. In the
fourth quarter, the Corporation concluded that revenues and profits in the
future, although significant, would continue below levels called for in the
agreement. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter, the Corporation reduced the
carrying value of the intangible asset by $116,000,000 to its expected net
realizable value and included this amount as a charge to Selling, General and
Administration (SG&A) expenses on the Statement of Operations. The remainder
of the intangible asset will be amortized over a period not to exceed eight
years using the greater of unit-volume or straight-line methods.
   
At the end of fiscal year 1994, the investment in Olivetti stock had a fair
value of $147,000,000. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the
Corporation sold all of its shares of Olivetti stock for approximately
$147,500,000.
   
On November 11, 1991, the Corporation signed an agreement with Philips
Electronics N.V. of The Netherlands to acquire most of the Philips
Information Systems Division ("Division"). The purchase price for the
acquired business was equal to the net asset value of the business as at
October 27, 1991, and was $146,387,000, net of cash acquired in the purchase.
The fiscal year 1992 operating results and statement of financial position
reflect the full consolidation of the acquired business as from October 28,
1991, including purchase price adjustments made in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1992.
  
The acquisition included the Division's activities for financial
institutions, small and medium enterprises,image and document management
systems and all related customer service activities. The acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities have
been recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.
  
The acquisition had no material effect on the total operating results for
fiscal year 1992, the year in which it was acquired.
  
Revenue and operating results for the Corporation's Digital-Kienzle business,
acquired in fiscal year 1991, fell significantly short of operating plan for
fiscal 1994 and from results of prior years despite restructuring efforts and
management changes in fiscal 1994 aimed at improving results. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, plans for further restructuring actions to be
taken in fiscal 1995 were finalized. The Corporation concluded that the
discounted cash flow, including restructuring actions associated with the
acquired business, will no longer support the carrying value of the
unamortized goodwill. Accordingly, the unamortized balance of goodwill
related to the acquisition of approximately $194,000,000 was written off as a
charge to operations.  This was included in SG&A expenses on the Statement of
Operations.
  
  
Note K - Stock Plans 
____________________________________________________________________________
  
Stock Options and Awards - Under its Equity Plan, the Corporation has awarded
restricted stock to certain officers and key employees. Under such Equity
Plan and its Restricted Stock Option Plans, the Corporation has granted
options to certain officers and key employees to purchase common stock at a
price determined by the Board of Directors. Shares purchased under the plans
are either subject to repurchase options and restrictions on sales which
lapse over an extended time period not exceeding 10 years, or become
exercisable ratably over periods of up to five years. In fiscal year 1992,
certain options were granted under such Equity Plan which become exercisable
ratably over five years, but only if the common stock achieves certain price
performance criteria.

The excess, if any, of the fair market value of shares on the measurement
date over the exercise price is charged to operations each year as the
restrictions lapse.
  
In May 1994, the Board of Directors approved a program to offer employees of
the Corporation (other than executive officers of the Corporation), the
opportunity to exchange their outstanding stock options for new options to
purchase a reduced number of shares of common stock at a per share exercise
price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date the
program was approved (the "Regrant Program"). Under the Regrant Program,
outstanding options granted between 1985 and 1993 to purchase up to
11,854,084 shares of common stock with an average exercise price of $59.43
per share could be exchanged for new options to purchase up to 4,554,870
shares with an exercise price of $22.88 per share. The new options vest over
four years and have a seven-year term. As of July 3, 1994 and as reflected in
the table above, options to purchase 5,765,914 shares had been exchanged and
canceled for new options to purchase a total of 2,328,910 shares. As of July
22, 1994, the last date for acceptance of the Regrant Program, options to
purchase a total of 10,208,736 shares had been exchanged and canceled for new
options to purchase a total of 3,969,630 shares. No compensation expense was
reversed as a result of the Regrant Program. Future expense associated with
options canceled, and not replaced by new options under the Regrant Program,
will no longer be recognized, resulting in an expense reduction of
approximately $31,000,000 over four years.
  
In April 1993, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of outstanding
options to purchase up to 2.8 million shares of common stock granted to
certain employees in fiscal year 1988 at an exercise price of $153.00 per
share which represented a discount of $30.00 per share from the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. The original options to
purchase 3.2 million shares were subject to restrictions lapsing and
amortizing ratably over ten years. Optionholders were offered $3.00 per
unexercised option share in return for the cancellation of the option. The
repurchase price was determined after taking into account option pricing
models, the opinion of an independent advisor and the financial and
compensation objectives of the program. The Corporation repurchased
approximately 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $8,000,000, which
was charged to operations in fiscal 1993. In addition, the Corporation
reversed compensation expense recorded in previous years of $31,843,000 with
a corresponding reduction of additional paid-in capital.
   
Employee Stock Purchase Plans - Under the Corporation's Employee Stock
Purchase Plans, all U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees may be granted the
opportunity to purchase common stock at 85% of market value on the first or
last business day of the six-month payment period, whichever is lower. Common
stock reserved for future employee purchases aggregated 5,133,014 shares at
July 2,1994. There were 6,938,772 shares issued at an average price of $23.72
per share during the year ended July 2,1994; 6,404,574 shares issued at an
average price of $28.38 per share during the year ended July 3,1993; and
4,788,819 shares issued at an average price of $43.21 per share during the
year ended June 27,1992. There have been no charges to income in connection
with these Plans other than incidental expenses related to the issuance of
the shares. Federal income tax benefits relating to such Plans, if any, have
been credited to additional paid-in capital.
  
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors - The Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors provides for a one-time grant of an option to purchase
5,000 shares of the Corporation's common stock to non-employee directors. The
exercise price of an option is 100% of the fair market value per share of
common stock of the Corporation on the date the option is granted. An
aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under
the Plan, of which 50,000 have been granted at an average purchase price of
$49.01 per share. The options become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year,
with credit given for past service. None of these options had been exercised
as of July 2, 1994.
  
 
Note L - Stockholders' Equity 
____________________________________________________________________________ 
 
On January 21, 1994, the Corporation filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, covering the registration of debt securities,
preferred stock, depositary shares, and warrants to purchase equity and debt
securities, in an aggregate amount of $1 billion. In March 1994, the
Corporation issued and sold 16,000,000 Depositary Shares under the shelf
registration statement, each representing a one-fourth interest in a share of
the Corporation's Series A 8 7/8% Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series A
Preferred Stock"), par value $1.00 per share. Dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock accrue at the annual rate of 8 7/8%, or $35,500,000 per year.
Dividends of $10,650,000 were declared in fiscal 1994 commencing in March
1994. At July 2, 1994, there were declared and unpaid dividends of
$8,875,000. These dividends were paid on July 15,1994.
  
The Series A Preferred Stock was offered to the public at $100 per share ($25
per Depositary Share) for a total of $400,000,000, leaving a balance of
$600,000,000 available for future issuance under the shelf registration. The
net proceeds of $387,000,000 from the Series A Preferred Stock offering is
available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The
Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares
of any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation. The Series A
Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to April 1,1999. On or after April
1,1999, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock, as a whole or in part, for cash at the redemption price per
share of $100 ($25 per Depositary Share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends
to the redemption date. Upon dissolution, liquidation or the winding up of
the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
will be entitled to receive $100 per share ($25 per Depositary Share), plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, before any distribution to holders of the
Corporation's common stock.
   
The Corporation did not purchase any shares of its common stock during fiscal
years 1994 and 1993. The Corporation purchased on the open market 3,014,083
shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $185,292,000, or
$61.48 per share, during the year ended June 27, 1992. All of the acquired
shares were held as common stock in treasury, and subsequently issued to
employees under the Stock Plans. The difference between the average
acquisition cost of the shares and the proceeds from issuance is charged to
retained earnings.
  
The Corporation adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan in December 1989 pursuant
to which the Corporation authorized the distribution of one Common Stock
Purchase Right for each share of outstanding common stock. Under certain
conditions, each Right may be exercised for one share of common stock at an
exercise price of $400, subject to adjustment. Under circumstances defined in
the Plan, the Rights entitle holders to purchase stock having a value of
twice the exercise price of the Rights. Until they become exercisable, the
Rights are not transferable apart from the common stock. The Rights may be
redeemed by the Corporation at any time prior to the occurrence of certain
events at $.01 per Right. The Plan will expire on December 21, 1999, unless
the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Corporation.
   
Note M - Subsequent Event 
____________________________________________________________________________

Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Corporation and Quantum
Corporation ("Quantum") signed an agreement providing for Quantum's purchase
of the Corporation's magnetic disk drive, tape drive, solid state disk and
thin-film heads businesses for $400,000,000, $70,000,000 of which is to be
paid in the form of an interest-bearing note. The transaction includes the
Corporation's interest in Rocky Mountain Magnetics, Inc., facilities in
Shrewsbury, Massachusetts and Penang, Malaysia, and the lease of facilities
in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Batam, Indonesia. There are approximately
5,000 regular and temporary employees in the businesses being sold.
   
The sale has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, but
is subject to appropriate government approvals and other conditions. The
transaction is expected to close shortly after October 1, 1994.
