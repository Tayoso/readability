                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business
- - -------  --------
(a)  General development of business:

Brown-Forman Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware in 1933, successor to a business founded in 1870 as a partnership and
subsequently incorporated under the laws of Kentucky in 1901.  Its principal
executive offices are located at 850 Dixie Highway, Louisville, Kentucky 40210
(mailing address:  P.O. Box 1080, Louisville, Kentucky 40201-1080).  Except as
the context may otherwise indicate, the terms "Brown-Forman" and "company" refer
to Brown-Forman Corporation and its subsidiaries.

(b)  Financial information about industry segments:

Information regarding net sales, operating income, and total assets of each of
the company's business segments is in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 34 of the company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders, which
information is incorporated herein by reference in response to Item 8.

(c)  Narrative description of business:

The following is a description of the operations in the business segments of
Wines and Spirits, Consumer Durables, and Other segments.

Wines and Spirits Segment
- - -------------------------

Wines and Spirits' operations include manufacturing, bottling, importing,
exporting, and marketing a wide variety of alcoholic beverage brands.  This
Segment also manufactures and markets new and used oak barrels, plastic
closures, and plastic bottles.

Brands are grouped into three categories:  North American Spirits, Imported and
Specialty Spirits, and Wines.

North American Spirits consists of the following brands:

                       Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey
                       Canadian Mist Canadian Whisky
                       Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails
                       Southern Comfort
                       Early Times Old Style Kentucky Whisky
                       Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky
                       Gentlemen Jack Rare Tennessee Whiskey
                       Korbel California Brandy
                       Pepe Lopez Tequila and related products

Statistics based on case sales, published annually by a leading trade
publication, rank Jack Daniel's as the largest selling Tennessee whiskey in the
United States, Canadian Mist as the largest selling Canadian whisky in the
United States, Southern Comfort as the largest selling domestic proprietary
liqueur in the United States, and Early Times as the second largest selling
brand in the bourbon category in the United States.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
Imported and Specialty Spirits consists of the following brands:

                         Bushmills Irish Whiskey and related products
                         Glenmorangie Single Highland Malt Scotch Whisky
                         Usher's Scotch Whisky
                         Sempe Armagnac

Wines consists of the following brands:

                         Fetzer Vineyards California Wines
                         Korbel California Champagnes
                         Bolla Italian Wines
                         Jekel Vineyards California Wines
                         Bel Arbors California Wines
                         Fontana Candida Italian Wines
                         Brolio Italian Wines
                         Carmen Vineyards Chilean Wines
                         Fontanafredda Italian Wines
                         Noilly Prat Vermouths
                         Armstrong Ridge California Champagne

A leading industry trade publication reported Korbel California Champagnes as
the largest selling premium champagne in the United States.  This trade
publication also reported that, among numerous imported wines, Bolla Italian
Wine is the leading premium imported table wine in the United States.  Fetzer
was ranked sixteenth among all table wines.

Brown-Forman believes that statistics used to rank these products are reasonably
accurate.

Brown-Forman's policy with respect to the Wines and Spirits Segment is to market
high quality products that satisfy consumer preferences and support them with
extensive international, national, and regional marketing programs.  These
programs are intended to extend consumer brand recognition and brand loyalty.

Sales managers and representatives or brokers represent the Segment in all
states.  The Segment distributes its spirits products domestically either
through state agencies or through wholesale distributors.  The contracts which
Brown-Forman has with many of its distributors have formulas which determine
reimbursement to distributors if Brown-Forman terminates them; the amount of
reimbursement is based primarily on the distributor's length of service and a
percentage of its purchases over time.  Some states have statutes which limit
Brown-Forman's ability to terminate distributor contracts.

Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Southern Comfort are the principal products
exported by the Segment.  These brands are sold through contracts with brokers
and distributors in most countries.

The principal raw materials used in manufacturing and packaging distilled
spirits are corn, rye, malted barley, glass, cartons, and wood for new white oak
barrels, which are used for storage of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey.  Sugar and
spirits are used in the production of specialties.  None of these raw materials
are in short supply, and there are adequate sources from which they may be
obtained.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Production of whiskies is scheduled to meet demand three to five years in the
future.  Accordingly, inventories are larger in relation to sales and total
assets than would be normal for most other business segments.

The industry is highly competitive and there are many brands sold in the
consumer market.  Trade information indicates that Brown-Forman is one of the
largest wine and spirit suppliers in the United States in terms of revenues.

The wine and spirits industry is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms of the United States Treasury Department with respect to
production, blending, bottling, sales, advertising, and transportation of its
products.  Also, each state regulates advertising, promotion, transportation,
sale, and distribution of such products.

Under federal regulations, whisky must be aged for at least two years to be
designated "straight whisky."  The Segment ages its straight whiskies for a
minimum of three to five years.  Federal regulations also require that
"Canadian" whisky must be manufactured in Canada in compliance with Canadian
laws and must be aged in Canada for at least three years.

Consumer Durables Segment
- - -------------------------

The Consumer Durables Segment includes the manufacturing and/or marketing of the
following:

                         Fine China Dinnerware
                         Contemporary Dinnerware
                         Crystal Stemware
                         Crystal Barware
                         China and Crystal Giftware
                         China and Crystal Lamps
                         Collectibles
                         Sterling Silver, Pewter and Silver-Plated
                             Giftware and Holloware
                         Sterling Silver and Stainless Steel Flatware
                         Fine Table Linens
                         Luggage and Handbags
                         Business Cases and Folios
                         Personal Leather Accessories

All of the products of the Segment are sold by segment-employed sales
representatives under various compensation arrangements, and where appropriate
to the class of trade, by specialized independent commissioned sales
representatives.

The Segment's products are marketed domestically through authorized retail
stores consisting of department stores and jewelry and specialty shops and
through retail stores operated by the Segment.  Products are also distributed
domestically through the institutional, incentive, premium, business gift and
military exchange classes of trade, and internationally through authorized
retailers and/or distributors in selected foreign markets.  Specially created
collectible products are distributed both domestically and in selected foreign
markets through the Segment's direct response/mail-order division.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
Fine china and crystal products are marketed under both the Lenox and Gorham
trademarks.  Contemporary dinnerware and glassware products are marketed under
the Dansk trademark.  Sterling silver is marketed under both the Gorham and Kirk
Stieff trademarks.  Kirk Stieff also markets pewter, stainless steel, and
silver-plated giftware, flatware and holloware.  Luggage, handbags, business
cases, and personal accessories are marketed under the Hartmann, Wings and
Crouch & Fitzgerald trademarks.  The direct response/mail-order sales in the
United States of specially designed collectibles are marketed under the Lenox,
Princeton Gallery and Gorham trademarks while such sales abroad are marketed
primarily under the Brooks & Bentley and Princeton Gallery trademarks.

The Lenox, Dansk, Gorham, and Hartmann brand names hold significant positions in
their industries.  The Segment has granted to a producer of high quality table
linens a license for use of the Lenox trademarks on selective fine table linens,
subject to the terms of a licensing agreement.

The Segment believes that it is the largest domestic manufacturer and marketer
of fine china dinnerware, fine crystal stemware, and pewter holloware, and the
only significant domestic manufacturer of fine quality china giftware.  The
Segment is also a leading manufacturer and distributor of fine quality luggage,
business cases, and personal leather accessories.  The Segment competes with a
number of other companies and is subject to intense foreign competition in the
marketing of its fine china and contemporary dinnerware, crystal stemware and
giftware, and luggage products.

In the Segment's china and crystal businesses, competition is based primarily on
quality, design, brand, style, product appeal, consumer satisfaction and price.
In its luggage, handbag, business case and personal leather accessories
business, competition is based primarily on brand awareness, quality, design,
style, and price.  In its direct response/mail-order business, the most
important competitive factors are the brand, product appeal, design,
sales/marketing program, service, and price of the products.  In its sterling
silver, silver-plated, and stainless steel business, competition is based
primarily on price, with quality, design, brand, style, product appeal, and
consumer satisfaction also being factors.  In its pewter business, competition
is based primarily on quality, design, brand, and delivery, with price being a
less significant factor.

Clay is the principal raw material used to manufacture china products and silica
is the principal raw material used to manufacture crystal products.  Leather and
nylon fabric are the principal raw materials used to manufacture luggage and
business cases.  Fine silver is the principal raw material used to manufacture
sterling silver giftware, flatware, and holloware products, and tin is the
principal raw material used to manufacture pewter products.  It is anticipated
that raw materials used by the Segment will be in adequate supply.  The
acquisition price of fine silver and tin is, however, influenced significantly
by world-wide economic events and commodity trading.

Sales of certain Segment products are traditionally greater in the second
quarter of the fiscal year, primarily because of seasonal holiday buying.

Other Segment
- - -------------

The Other business segment included a credit card transaction processing
business and an aquaculture business.  For further information, please refer to
Note 8, "Business Segment Information," on page 34 of the company's 1994 Annual
Report to Stockholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference in
response to Item 8.  The credit card transaction processing business was sold in
October 1993 and the use of this segment was discontinued effective November 1,
1993.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- - -------  -----------------

   (a) Brune v. Brown-Forman Corporation (214th District Court, Neuces County,
       Texas):
       On November 15, 1983, Marie Brinkmeyer, age 18, died of an acute alcohol
       overdose after having consumed massive quantities of alcohol including
       Pepe Lopez Tequila (a Brown-Forman product).  Two years later, her
       mother, Joyce Brune, sued Brown-Forman Corporation both on her own behalf
       and on behalf of Ms. Brinkmeyer's estate, claiming (1) that the company
       was negligent in not labeling Pepe Lopez Tequila to warn Ms. Brinkmeyer
       of the risk of acute alcohol overdose or to provide instructions for the
       appropriate use of the product and (2) that such failure rendered the
       product defective.  The plaintiff alleged damages resulting from the
       company's advertising and alleged lobbying activities.  The company
       denied all of the plaintiff's allegations and vigorously contested this
       litigation.

       Plaintiff asked for actual damages of up to $5 million and punitive
       damages of $600 million, plus interest and costs.  The case went to trial
       before a jury in Corpus Christi on August 31, 1992.

       The jury's verdict against Brown-Forman of $525,000 plus interest
       resulted from its finding Brown-Forman to be 35% at fault and Marie
       Brinkmeyer to be 65% at fault on a total damage award of $1.5 million.
       (Texas is a "comparative negligence" state.)  The jury refused to award
       punitive damages.  The company has appealed the decision.  Oral argument
       was held on February 3, 1994 before the Texas Court of Appeals in Corpus
       Christi.  The company is awaiting a decision.

   (b) Adams, et al. v. Brown-Forman Corporation (U.S. District Court, Middle
       District of Florida, Tampa  Division):
       As previously reported, Brown-Forman Corporation terminated approximately
       220 employees in a November 1986 reorganization.  All terminated
       employees received special compensation packages and signed complete
       releases waiving any rights they might have as a result of their
       termination.  Nonetheless, the company was named as a defendant in four
       related lawsuits, filed in 1988 and 1989, alleging violation of the Age
       Discrimination in Employment Act (the "ADEA") related to this termination
       process.

       Three of the suits, collectively referred to as Adams, et al. v. Brown-
       Forman Corporation, were filed by or on behalf of the same 44 plaintiffs;
       the fourth suit was filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
       Commission (the "EEOC") on behalf of 104 individuals, including the Adams
       plaintiffs.  The lawsuits have been consolidated for trial in the U.S.
       District Court for the Middle District of Florida.  During the course of
       this litigation, the EEOC has ceased representation of 19 individuals,
       thus reducing the total to 85 individuals.

       The 44 Adams plaintiffs have asserted their damages to be approximately
       $62 million.  The EEOC, using the same expert as that used by the
       plaintiffs in the private actions, has determined the EEOC's damage claim
       to be $43 million for the individuals on whose behalf it has brought
       suit, bringing the total claimed to $105 million.  The company and its
       legal counsel consider this figure to exceed by far any liability to
       which the company might be exposed.  The company denies any liability to
       the plaintiffs or individuals on whose part the EEOC has brought suit in
       these matters and is vigorously contesting the litigation.

       On June 17, 1992, the Eleventh Circuit Court of appeals reversed a
       decision of the trial court and ruled in the company's favor that
       "knowing and voluntary" written releases are valid, even when 

                                      -9-
<PAGE>
 
       plaintiffs are making ADEA claims. The company filed a motion for summary
       judgment on the release and other issues.  The magistrate judge heard
       oral argument on January 5, 1993, and on September 30, 1993, made a
       report and recommendation to the district court that the releases were
       valid as to ten of the plaintiffs and recommended that their cases should
       be dismissed.  The magistrate judge found there were "genuine issues of
       material fact" on the release and other issues with respect to the
       remaining 75 plaintiffs, and recommended that the motion for summary
       judgment be denied as to them.

       Both sides filed exceptions to the magistrate judge's report and
       recommendation.  After the court makes a decision on the recommendation,
       a trial date will be set for the remaining plaintiffs, if any.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



Brown-Forman Corporation
Louisville, Kentucky


We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Brown-Forman
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and for the
years then ended, which financial statements are included on pages 26 through 36
of the 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders of Brown-Forman Corporation and
incorporated by reference herein.  We have also audited the financial statement
schedules listed in the index on page 14 of this Form 10-K.  These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Brown-Forman
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be
included therein.

As discussed in Notes 2, 5, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, in
1994 the company adopted changes in its methods of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions, postemployment benefits, and contributions.

    restricted by reference to or inference from the terms of any other clause
    in this Certificate of Incorporation, but that the several objects specified
    in this clause shall be regarded as independent objects, nor shall anything
    in this clause be held to limit or restrict, in any manner, the powers of
    this Corporation.

FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is Fifty-Five Million, One Hundred Seventy-Seven
Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty-Eight (55,177,948) shares, divided into (a) One
Million, One Hundred Seventy-Seven Thousand, Nine Hundred Forty-Eight)
(1,177,948) shares of Preferred Stock of the par value of Ten Dollars ($10)
each; (b) Eighteen Million (18,000,000) shares of Class A Common Stock of the
par value of Fifteen Cents (15c) each, and (c) Thirty-Six Million (36,000,000)
shares of Class B Common Stock of the par value of Fifteen Cents (15c) each.

RIGHTS OF PREFERRED STOCK:

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends at the
rate of, but never exceeding Forty Cents (40c) per share per annum, payable
quarterly, on the first days of January, April, July, and October in each year,
such dividends to be paid only out of such surplus or net earnings of the
Corporation as shall be made applicable to the payment of such dividends by the
Board of Directors. Such dividends shall be cumulative from July 1, 1948, and
shall be payable before any dividends shall be paid on, or set apart for, the
Common Stock, so that if in any year dividends amounting to Forty Cents (40c)
per share shall not have been paid on the Preferred Stock, the deficiency shall
be payable before any dividends shall be paid on, or set apart for, the Common
Stock.

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to be paid in 

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
full out of the assets of the Corporation the sum of Ten Dollars ($10) per
share, together with the unpaid dividends accrued thereon, before any amount
shall be paid out of such assets to the holders of the Common Stock, and after
such payment in full to the holders of the Preferred stock, the remaining assets
shall be divided among and paid to the holders of the Common Stock of both
Classes, share and share alike. The consolidation or merger of the Corporation
with or into any other corporation or corporations, in pursuance of the statutes
of Delaware providing for consolidation or merger, shall not be deemed a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation within
the meaning of any of the provisions of this Amended Certificate of
Incorporation.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no voting powers in the election
of directors, or on any question, except as otherwise provided by the laws of
Delaware.

CONVERSION OF THE HERETOFORE ISSUED SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND OF CLASS
B COMMON STOCK:

Each of the heretofore issued shares of Class A Common Stock, par value Thirty
Cents (30c) per share, is hereby changed into Two (2) shares of Class A Common
Stock, par value Fifteen Cents (15c) per share, and each of the heretofore
issued shares of Class B Common Stock, par value Thirty Cents (30c) per share,
is hereby changed into Two (2) shares of Class B Common Stock, par value Fifteen
Cents (15c) per share. Each issued stock certificate of the Corporation which
immediately prior to the time this Amendment becomes effective represented one
or more shares of Class A Common Stock, par value Thirty Cents (30c) per share,
shall thereafter represent the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock,
par value Fifteen Cents (15c) per share; and each issued stock certificate of
the Corporation which immediately prior to the time this Amendment becomes
effective represented one or more shares of Class B Common Stock, par value
Thirty Cents (30c) per share, shall thereafter represent the same number of
shares of Class B Common Stock, par value Fifteen Cents (15c) per share. To each
holder of the issued shares of Class A Common Stock of the 

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
Corporation of record on its books immediately prior to the time this Amendment
becomes effective, the Corporation shall issue and deliver an additional stock
certificate (or certificates) for a number of shares of its class A Common
Stock, equal in the aggregate, to the number of issued shares of Class A Common
Stock registered in the name of such stockholder at said time; and to each
holder of the issued shares of Class B Common Stock of the Corporation of record
on its books immediately prior to the time this Amendment becomes effective, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver an additional stock certificate (or
certificates) for a number of shares of its Class B Common Stock equal, in the
aggregate, to the number of issued shares of Class B Common Stock registered in
the name of such stockholder at said time.

The remaining authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock and of
Class B Common Stock may be issued and sold from time to time by the Corporation
for such consideration and upon such terms as may from time to time be fixed by
the Board of Directors, without action by the stockholders.

RIGHTS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK:

Every share of the common stock of both classes, whenever and for whatever
consideration issued, shall be entitled to the same rights as every other share
of common stock in all distributions of earnings or assets of the Corporation
distributable to the holders of the common stock.

Whenever all cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock for all previous years
shall have been declared and shall have become payable, and the accrued
installments for the current year shall have been declared and the Corporation
shall have paid such cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock for the
previous years and such accrued installments, or shall have set apart from its
surplus or net profits a sum sufficient for the payment thereof, the Board of
Directors may forthwith, without waiting for the expiration of the current year,
declare dividends on both classes of the common stock, payable then or
thereafter out of any remaining surplus or net profits.

                                      -7-

Except as herein provided, the holders of the Class A Common Stock shall have
full and exclusive voting powers. The Class B Common Stock shall be in all
respects equal and identical to the Class A Common Stock except that the holders
of the Class B Common Stock shall have no voting powers in the election of
directors, or on any question, except as otherwise provided by the laws of
Delaware.

GENERAL PROVISIONS:

The Corporation, on the sole authority of its Board of Directors, shall have the
right at any time after July 1, 1957, to redeem and retire all or any part of
the shares of the Preferred Stock at such time outstanding upon notice mailed,
at least thirty (30) days before the date of redemption, to the holders of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be so redeemed, at their last known post office
address as shown by the records of the Corporation, by paying Ten Dollars and
Twenty-Five Cents ($10.25) per share of the Preferred Stock to be so redeemed,
and all unpaid accrued dividends due thereon. In case of the redemption of a
part only of the Preferred Stock, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by
lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors may determine. If notice
shall be given as aforesaid, and if the Corporation shall have set apart the
funds necessary to effect the redemption of the stock, and any holder of
Preferred Stock shall not present his stock to the Corporation for redemption on
or before the redemption date specified in the notice, thereupon such stock
shall be deemed canceled and retired and shall not thereafter be entitled to
receive any further dividends. The moneys so set apart for the redemption of the
Preferred Stock shall be paid without interest to the proper owners of such
stock upon the surrender to the Corporation of the certificates representing
such stock. None of the Preferred Stock so redeemed shall be reissued, but the
Corporation shall, from time to time and at any convenient time, cause all such
stock to be retired in the manner provided by law and its capital stock to be
reduced accordingly.

for and against said amendment, which vote was conducted by three inspectors
appointed for the purpose by said meeting; that at said meeting said inspectors
decided upon the qualifications of the voters, took and accepted their vote,
and, when the vote was completed, counted and ascertained the number of shares
of each class voted respectively for and against the amendment and declared that
persons or bodies corporate holding or entitled to vote 10,349,961.363 shares of
Class A Common Stock of the Corporation, being more than a majority of the

                            BROWN-FORMAN CORPORATION

                     MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

                        Revisions effective:  May 1, 1993


DEFINITIONS

Board:  the Company's Board of Directors.

Company:  Brown-Forman Corporation, a Delaware corporation.

Fiscal Year:  the Company's operating year which begins May 1 and ends on April
30.

Participant: a participant in the Plan.  See Section III for eligibility.

Plan:  the Company's Management Incentive Compensation Plan.

Plan Administrator:  the administrator of the Plan, as defined in Section II.

Step:  a move of one salary grade in the same bonus group or a move of one bonus
group in the same salary grade.

Subsidiary:  a corporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock
of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly.


I.  OBJECTIVES

     The objectives of the Company's Management Incentive Compensation Plan are:

     A. To optimize the profitability and growth of the Company through
        incentives, consistent with the other goals of the organization;

     B. To promote teamwork among members of management staffs, as well as to
        encourage excellence in the performance of individual responsibilities;

     C. To provide significant incentive opportunity for those members of
        management who make significant contributions to the Company's success;

     D. To allow participants in the Plan to share in the success of the
        Company.


II.  PLAN ADMINISTRATOR

     The Management Incentive Compensation Plan will be administered by the
     Compensation Committee of the Board for Participants in Group I, as defined
     in Section V, and by the Management Salary Committee for all other
     Participants.  The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to construe,
     interpret, and administer the Plan subject to the limitations set forth
     herein.  The Plan Administrator may designate officers of the Company or a
     Subsidiary to implement administration.
<PAGE>
 
III. ELIGIBILITY

     A. Key Members of Management

        Participation in this Plan shall include those officers and employees of
        the Company or a Subsidiary who because of their position and
        responsibilities comprise, in the opinion of the Plan Administrator as
        discussed in Section II above, key members of management of the Company.

     B. Directors

        Directors of the Company who are also employees of the Company or a
        Subsidiary shall be eligible to participate. Members of the Board who
        are not also employees of the Company or a Subsidiary shall, however, be
        ineligible for awards under this Plan.

     C. A person who is compensated on the basis of a fee or retainer, as
        distinguished from salary, shall not be eligible, nor shall any employee
        or officer who is a current participant in any other Company or
        individual incentive program.


IV.  EFFECTIVE DATE

     This Plan shall be effective starting with the fiscal year beginning May 1,
     1980, and shall remain in effect until terminated by the Board.


V.   INCENTIVE AWARD POTENTIALS

     A. Bonus Groups

        Participants shall be classified into one of four incentive groups
        designated by Roman numerals I through IV, and into one of two incentive
        subgroups designated by the letters A through B. The incentive groups
        are defined by their level of decision-making:

               Group I:       Top decision makers
               Group II:      Other key senior management decision makers
               Group III:     Other key executives and managers
               Group IV:      All other Participants

         These incentive group designations, used in conjunction with the
         subgroups A through B, comprise bonus groups specifying levels of
         targeted incentive award ("Target Award"). The Target Award for a
         Participant in a fiscal year shall be determined by multiplying the
         midpoint of the Participant's salary grade for the fiscal year by the
         percentage applicable to the Participant's bonus group, as set forth in
         Exhibit A. Exhibit A also defines the level of maximum incentive award
         per Participant.

     B.  Prorations

         The Plan Administrator may add a Participant to the Plan, or change the
         award potentials of a Participant, due to a Participant's hiring,
         transfer, promotion or demotion during the fiscal year. A Participant
         who is hired or has a change of grade during the fiscal year will
         receive a prorated award potential for time spent in each grade. A
         newly hired Participant's length of service, for proration purposes,
         will be calculated based on the date of employment rounded to the
         nearest one-half month. A demoted 
<PAGE>
 
         Participant, or a Participant promoted one or more steps, will have his
         or her award potential prorated based on the date of demotion or
         promotion rounded to the nearest one-half month.

         Should a change in grade produce a change of more than two steps, the
         bonus potential will also be prorated at 50% of the new potential and
         50% of the old potential for a period of one year from the date of the
         change. This is in addition to any applicable proration for part-year
         coverage by one or both bonus potentials.

         A Participant who works during a fiscal year in more than one group or
         Subsidiary with different plan goals and payment determination will
         receive a prorated award potential for time spent in each group or
         Subsidiary.

     C.  Neither Plan eligibility, participation in this Plan, the granting of
         any incentive award potential, nor the receipt of any incentive payment
         shall give any employee any right to a subsequent award or payment, or
         to continued employment by the Company or a Subsidiary for any period
         of time. The Company specifically reserves the right and authority to
         dismiss or discharge any employee.


VI.  PERFORMANCE GOALS AND DETERMINATION OF PAYMENT

     Because the Plan includes Participants from multiple groups and divisions
     of the Company, performance goals and determination of payment will vary
     across organizational units and/or bonus groups.  Those exhibits following
     Exhibit A comprise group-by-group summaries of performance goals and
     payment determinations.

     Incentive payments granted to a Participant for a fiscal year shall be paid
     in cash within 90 days after the close of that fiscal year.  However, no
     employee or officer has any vested interest or right to any award unless
     and until such award is actually paid.


VII. TERMINATION

     If a Participant terminates from the employ of the Company before the end
     of the fiscal year, such Participant may, at the discretion of the Plan
     Administrator, be eligible to receive a pro rata award based upon the
     Participant's Target Award, the level of achievement in relation to
     targeted goals, and the amount of time worked.  The Plan Administrator will
     determine the payment date for a pro rata award.


VIII.  LEAVE OF ABSENCE OR DISABILITY

     A Participant who becomes disabled or who is granted a leave of absence
     during a fiscal year may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be
     eligible to receive a pro rata award based upon the Participant's Target
     Award, the level of achievement in relation to targeted goals, and the
     amount of time worked.  The Plan Administrator will determine the payment
     date for a pro rata award.
<PAGE>
 
IX.  DEATH

     If a Participant dies before the end of the fiscal year, his or her estate
     may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be eligible to receive a
     pro rata award based upon the Participant's Target Award, the level of
     achievement in relation to targeted goals, and the amount of time worked.
     The Participant's estate will be paid the full value of the award if the
     entire fiscal year was completed but death occurred prior to payment.  The
     Plan Administrator will determine the payment date for a pro rata bonus
     award.


X.   NORMAL OR EARLY RETIREMENT

     A Participant who retires before a fiscal year end may, at the discretion
     of the Plan Administrator, be eligible to receive a pro rata award based
     upon the Participant's Target Award, the level of achievement in relation
     to targeted goals, and the amount of time worked.  The Plan Administrator
     will determine the payment date for a pro rata award.

XI.  WITHHOLDING OF TAXES

     The Plan Administrator may make such provisions and take such steps as it
     may deem necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which
     the Company is required by any law or regulation of any governmental
     authority, whether Federal, state, or local, domestic or foreign, to
     withhold in connection with any incentive payment under the provisions of
     this Plan; including, but not limited to, the withholding of payment of all
     or any portion of such award until the Participant reimburses the Company
     for the amount the Company is required to withhold with respect to such
     taxes, or cancelling any portion of such award in an amount sufficient to
     reimburse itself for the amount it is required to so withhold, or selling
     any property contingently credited by the Company for the purpose of paying
     such award, in order to withhold or reimburse itself for the amount it is
     required to so withhold.

XII. AMENDMENTS

     The Board reserves the right to modify or terminate this Plan, with or
     without notice, in whole or in part, at any time.

Notes:

       1. Market pay levels may dictate that awards be made at less than these 
          target amounts, but greater amounts will not be granted.

       2. There is no set maximum on an individual's incentive award. Instead,
          each business unit has an aggregate maximum incentive award equal to
          170% of the sum of the target incentives for which all participants in
          that business unit are eligible, as shown.

                                   EXHIBIT B:

          FISCAL 1994 PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PAYMENT DETERMINATION FOR
                               BFBC PARTICIPANTS


1.   The Management Salary Committee of the Company will annually set a
     threshold level and a maximum level of Brown-Forman Beverage Company income
     for calculation of the bonus pool available for award to BFBC Participants.

2.   The size of the bonus pool available for award to BFBC Participants will
     vary with the level of BFBC capital employed during the fiscal year, and
     with the level of BFBC income achieved for such year in excess of the
     threshold level, but will in no case exceed the total of awards at maximum
     as provided in Exhibit A.

3.   Ninety-three percent (93%) of the bonus pool will be awarded to BFBC
     Participants based upon each BFBC Participant's Target Award as a
     percentage of the total of all BFBC Participants' Target Awards.

4.   Two percent (2%) of the bonus pool will be distributed by the Chairman and
     the President of BFBC to BFBC Participants whose fiscal year performance
     has been extraordinary, upon recommendation of a Group Executive.

5.   Five percent (5%) of the bonus pool will be distributed by Group Executives
     to BFBC Participants on a discretionary basis, based upon the Group
     Executive's evaluation of the BFBC Participant's fiscal year performance.

6.   A Group Executive may withhold all or any portion of a BFBC Participant's
     award if the BFBC Participant's fiscal year performance has been
     significantly below job standards, as defined in the BFBC Participant's
     position description.  Any amount so withheld must be distributed by the
     Group Executive to other BFBC Participants on a discretionary basis, based
     upon the Group Executive's evaluation of those BFBC Participants' fiscal
     year performance.

          FISCAL 1994 PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PAYMENT DETERMINATION FOR
                            PARTICIPANTS IN GROUP I


1.   As soon as is practical for each fiscal year, the Board of Directors, in
     its absolute discretion, shall establish Earnings Per Share goals for the
     said fiscal year, which shall reflect what the Board of Directors deems to
     be, in light of all existing and foreseen circumstances, appropriate
     Earnings Per Share goals.

2.   The term "Earnings Per Share" as used herein shall mean the audited
     Earnings Per Share as presented in the Company's Annual Report adjusted for
     the after-tax effect of incentive payments.  Adjustments due to changes in
     the accounting principles during the fiscal year, the impact of
     acquisitions during the fiscal year, and extraordinary or unusual items may
     be made at the discretion of the Plan Administrator.

3.   Incentive compensation funds for Group I Participants will be generated by
     actual performance based upon Earnings Per Share of the Company as approved
     by the Board of Directors.  Incentive payments will be earned pursuant to a
     schedule set for each fiscal year by the Plan Administrator.

4.   Upon the attainment of minimal goals as approved by the Board of Directors,
     a Group I Participant will accrue 100% of the appropriate incentive
     compensation amount computed as soon as practical after the certification
     of results by the Company's independent auditors.

          FISCAL 1994 PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PAYMENT DETERMINATION FOR
                       NON-BFBC PARTICIPANTS IN GROUP IV


1.   Incentive compensation funds for non-BFBC Participants in Group IV will be
     generated by actual performance against the corporate and/or divisional
     operating plans for which the Participant primarily works.  Incentive
     payments will be earned pursuant to a schedule set for each fiscal year by
     the Plan Administrator (Exhibit A).  The schedule will be based on an
     annual plan and will be established as soon as practical for each fiscal
     year.

2.   Upon attainment of minimal goals as approved by the Executive Committee, a
     non-BFBC Participant in Group IV will automatically accrue 50% of the
     appropriate incentive compensation amount computed in accordance with
     corporate and/or divisional performance results.

3.   The remaining 50% of the accrued incentive compensation amount for non-BFBC
     Participants in Group IV will be distributed in whole or in part on a
     discretionary basis.  The discretionary awards will be based on the
     manager's evaluation of individual performance, upon approval by the Group
     Executive.

EARNINGS PER SHARE:  the Company's audited earnings per share as presented in
the Company's Annual Report, as adjusted for the after-tax effect of incentive
awards under incentive plans maintained by the Company.  The Plan Administrator
may adjust Earnings Per Share for the purposes of this Plan to account for
changes in the accounting principles during the Fiscal Year, the impact of
acquisitions during the Fiscal Year, and extraordinary or unusual items.

ESCROW AGENT:  National City Trust (formerly First Kentucky Trust Company).

FISCAL YEAR:  a year beginning May 1 and ending April 30.

PARTICIPANTS:  participants in the Plan.  (See Section 3 for eligibility.)

PLAN:  the Brown-Forman Corporation Restricted Stock Plan.

PLAN ADMINISTRATOR:  the Compensation Committee of the Board.

RESTRICTED STOCK:  Class A Common Stock and/or Class B Common Stock of the
Company, restricted as set forth below, which is purchased and held by the
Escrow Agent in the name of the Plan's Participants.

SALARY:  the straight-time annualized amount (before deferrals) paid to a
Participant for work performed, excluding seasonal supplement, bonus, long-term
incentive, and expense reimbursement payments of all kinds.

SALARY GRADE MIDPOINT:  the middle value of the range of salary levels typically
permitted for a given grade or rank assigned to a Participant.

STEP:  a move of one salary grade in the same bonus group or a move of one bonus
group in the same salary grade.

SUBSIDIARY:  a corporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock
of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly.

WINDOW PERIOD:  a period beginning on the third business day following the
public release of the Company's quarterly or annual sales and earnings
information, and ending on the twelfth business day following such public
release.

1. OBJECTIVES:  The Plan's objectives are to:
   (a) optimize the Company's profitability and growth through long-term stock
       incentives, consistent with the Company's other goals;

   (b) encourage teamwork among members of management staffs and excellence in
       the performance of individual responsibilities;

   (c) provide significant rewards for those members of management who make
       significant contributions to the Company's success; and

   (d) allow Participants to share in the Company's long-term success.

2. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR:  The Plan Administrator shall construe, interpret, and
   administer the Plan subject to the limitations set forth below.
<PAGE>
 
3. ELIGIBILITY:
   (a) Participation in this Plan is limited to those employees of the Company
      and its Subsidiaries who, because of their position and responsibilities,
      constitute (in the opinion of the Plan Administrator) key members of the
      Company's management.

   (b) Members of the Board who are also employees of the Company or a
      Subsidiary may participate in the Plan; other Board members may not.

   (c) A person compensated on a fee or retainer basis, as distinguished from
      salary, may not participate in the Plan.

4. EFFECTIVE DATE:  This Plan shall be effective starting with Fiscal Year 1989,
   and shall remain in effect until the Board terminates it.

5. PARTICIPATION:
   (a)  (1)  Five groups are eligible to participate in the Plan:
             Group I-A:             Chief Executive Officer
             Group I-B:             Other top decision makers
             Groups II-A and II-B:  Other key senior management decision makers
             Group III-A:           Other key executives and managers
   
        (2) During a Fiscal Year, the Plan Administrator may add a Participant
        to a group or change a Participant's eligibility in the Plan due to a
        Participant's hiring or promotion. Changes in eligibility due to a
        promotion of three or more steps for a twelve month period will be based
        on 50% of the old bonus award eligibility plus 50% of the new bonus
        award eligibility. A newly hired Participant's length of service, for
        proration purposes, will be calculated based on the Participant's date
        of employment (rounded to the nearest one-half month). Awards to
        promoted Participants will be prorated based on the date of promotion
        (rounded to the nearest one-half month).

   (b) Awards will be determined for Participants within each group as follows:
        (1) Groups I-A and I-B - Top Decision Makers:  For each Fiscal Year, the
        Plan Administrator will establish Earnings Per Share goals (threshold,
        plan, and maximum) upon which the awards for Group I-A and I-B
        Participants will be based.  Awards will be calculated as a percentage
        of each Participant's Salary as of the first day of the Fiscal Year for
        which the award is being made.
        
        (2) Groups II-A and II-B - Other Key Senior Management Decision Makers:
        For each Fiscal Year, the Plan Administrator will establish Earnings Per
        Share goals and/or divisional operating goals (threshold, plan, and
        maximum) for which the Participant works, and upon which the awards for
        Group II-A and II-B Participants will be based.  Awards will be
        calculated as a percentage of each Participant's Salary Grade Midpoint
        as of the first day of the Fiscal Year for which the award is being
        made.

        (3) Group III-A - Other Key Executives and Managers:  For each Fiscal
        Year, the Plan Administrator will establish the divisional or corporate
        operating goals (threshold, plan, and maximum) for which the Participant
        works and upon which the awards for Group III-A Participants will be
        based.  Awards will be calculated as a percentage of each Participant's
        Salary Grade Midpoint as of the first day of the Fiscal Year for which
        the award is being made.

6. OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INCENTIVE AWARDS:  Receiving an award under
   this Plan shall not give a Participant any right to a later award or to
   continued employment by the Company or a Subsidiary for any period of time,
   nor shall granting an award give the Company or a Subsidiary any right to a
   Participant's continued services for any period of time.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
7. GRANT OF AWARDS:
   (a) Timing:  As soon as practical after the certification of financial
       results by the Company's independent auditors (and subject to adjustment
       by the Plan Administrator), awards as determined under Section 5 shall be
       payable in shares of Restricted Stock to be held in escrow for the
       Participant by the Escrow Agent until such time as restrictions lapse.

   (b) Calculation of Awards; Adjustments:
      (1) The number of shares of Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant for
          a Fiscal Year shall be determined by dividing the dollar value of the
          award for such Fiscal Year, as determined under Subsection 5(b) above,
          by the weighted average of the closing price of the Company's Class A
          Common Stock and/or Class B Common Stock for the last five trading
          days of the previous Fiscal Year, rounded up to the next whole share.
      (2) The total number of shares of Restricted Stock which the Plan
          Administrator may award to all Participants during a Fiscal Year shall
          be limited to 1% of the number of shares of Class A and Class B Common
          Stock outstanding on the date that the Plan Administrator determines
          awards.

      (3) The Plan Administrator may, subject to Paragraph 7(b)(2), in its sole
          discretion, adjust awards of Restricted Stock to account for: stock
          dividends or stock splits; a recapitalization, reorganization, merger,
          consolidation, or other change in capitalization; the Company's sale
          of all or a significant part of its assets; any distribution to
          stockholders other than a cash dividend; securities of the Company or
          another entity's being exchanged for or received in lieu of the
          Company's Class A or Class B Common Stock; or new, different, or
          additional shares or other securities of the Company or of any other
          corporation's being received by the holders of outstanding shares of
          the Company's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. Any such
          adjustment by the Plan Administrator, and any determination by the
          Plan Administrator that an adjustment is not appropriate, shall be
          effective and binding for all purposes of this Plan and of all shares
          of Restricted Stock then outstanding.

8. RESTRICTIONS:
   (a) Except as provided below, a Participant may not sell, exchange, transfer,
       pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of shares of Restricted Stock.

   (b) The restrictions set forth in Subsection 8(a) on the shares of Restricted
       Stock constituting a Fiscal Year's award shall lapse as to one-third of
       such shares at the end of each of the second, third, and fourth Fiscal
       Years succeeding the Fiscal Year for which the award is granted.

   (c) Participants will receive dividends on Restricted Stock as declared and
       paid by the Company, commencing with the receipt of Restricted Stock.

   (d) If the Company decides to undergo a consolidation or merger, or to sell,
       lease, or convey all or substantially all the assets of the Company, the
       restrictions on Restricted Stock may be waived at the discretion of the
       Plan Administrator.

   (e) If a Participant sells any shares of stock of the Company which were
       acquired under this Plan within 60 days after the date when the
       restrictions on such shares lapse, the Company will bear the
       Participant's cost of selling such shares.

   (f) If a Participant leaves the employ of the Company because of death,
       permanent disability, retirement, or early retirement under the Company's
       Salaried Employee Retirement Plan, or at the request of the Company
       (other than for "cause"), the Participant will receive shares of
       Restricted Stock as specified in Sections 9, 10, 11, or 12 of this Plan.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
  (g) Each certificate evidencing shares of Restricted Stock shall bear an
      appropriate legend referring to the restrictions applicable to such
      shares.

9. RESIGNATION OR TERMINATION:  If a Participant voluntarily leaves the employ
   of the Company or is terminated for cause (for example, acts of dishonesty or
   gross misconduct), the Participant shall forfeit any and all interest in the
   Plan and any Restricted Stock.  Exceptions may be granted at the discretion
   of the Plan Administrator.  Participants terminated by the Company for any
   other reasons will receive all Restricted Stock free from restrictions and
   will be granted a pro-rata award for the Fiscal Year in which they were
   terminated.  These awards will be free of restrictions at a time determined
   by the Plan Administrator but in no event later than described in Subsection
   8(b) above.

10. DISABILITY:  A Participant eligible for an award of Restricted Stock who
    becomes totally and permanently disabled during a Fiscal Year may, at the
    discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted a pro-rata Restricted Stock
    award based on salary grade midpoint, level of achievement in relation to
    targets, and amount of time worked.  This award and any Restricted Stock
    previously granted shall be released from all restrictions as soon as
    possible after the determination of total and permanent disability.

11. DEATH:  A Participant who was eligible for an award of Restricted Stock and
    dies during the Fiscal Year may, at the discretion of the Plan
    Administrator, have granted to his or her estate a pro-rata Restricted Stock
    award based on salary grade midpoint, level of achievement in relation to
    targets, and amount of time worked.  This award and any Restricted Stock
    previously granted shall be released from all restrictions as soon as
    possible after the date of death.

12. NORMAL OR EARLY RETIREMENT:  A Participant who is eligible for an award of
    Restricted Stock and retires during a Fiscal Year may, at the discretion of
    the Plan Administrator, be awarded a pro-rata Restricted Stock award based
    on salary grade midpoint, level of achievement in relation to targets, and
    the amount of time worked.  Participants who retire at the end of the Fiscal
    Year will be awarded the full number of Restricted Stock shares.  These
    awards and any Restricted Stock previously granted shall be released from
    all restrictions at a time determined by the Plan Administrator, but in no
    event later than described in Subsection 8(b) above.

13. SHARE WITHHOLDING:  Participants may elect, subject to the approval of the
    Plan Administrator, to satisfy, in whole or in part, the tax liability
    arising upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock by one of the methods set
    forth below.  The maximum value of the shares which may be withheld pursuant
    to Subsections (a) or (b) below, or the value of the shares which may be
    surrendered pursuant to Subsection (c) below, is limited to the sum of the
    maximum federal, state, and local income tax rates in the state in which the
    Participant is resident times the value of the vesting shares of Restricted
    Stock.

   (a) A Participant may deliver to the Plan Administrator, more than six months
       before the vesting of Restricted Stock, a written election to have shares
       withheld. Any modification or revocation of such an election shall be
       effective no earlier than six months following the date it is delivered
       to the Plan Administrator.

   (b) A Participant may deliver to the Plan Administrator, during a Window
       Period, a written election to have shares withheld.  Any modification or
       revocation of such an election may be made only during a Window Period.

   (c) A Participant may deliver to the Company, within 60 business days before
       or after the vesting of Restricted Stock, previously owned shares.

                                      -4-

14. AMENDMENTS:  The Plan Administrator has full power and final authority to
    construe, interpret and administer the Plan.  The Board has the right to
    change, modify, or terminate the Plan, with or without notice, in whole or
    in part, at any time.

1.  All per common share data reflect the three-for-one stock split on May 20,
    1994.
2.  On May 1, 1993, the company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
    Benefits Other Than Pensions," and No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
    Postemployment Benefits." In the third quarter of 1994, the company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, "Accounting for
    Contributions Received and Contributions Made," and restated the first
    quarter as if adoption had occurred May 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of
    these accounting changes reduced net income in the first quarter of 1994 by
    $32,542,000 or $.39 per share.
3.  Quarterly earnings per share amounts do not add to year-to-date earnings per
    share for fiscal 1994 because of changes in the number of outstanding shares
    during the year.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

  We are responsible for the presentation of the information contained in the
consolidated financial statements and for its integrity and objectivity.  Our
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and include amounts based on our best estimates and judgments with
appropriate consideration given to materiality.  We also prepared the related
financial information and are responsible for its accuracy and consistency with
the financial statements.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Coopers & Lybrand,
independent certified public accountants.  We have made available to Coopers &
Lybrand all the company's financial records and related data, as well as the
minutes of stockholders', directors', and other appropriate meetings.
Furthermore, we believe that all representations made to Coopers & Lybrand
during the audit were valid and appropriate.
  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal
control designed to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable costs that
financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements.  The company
has an internal audit function that is intended to provide a review and
monitoring process that allows the company to be reasonably sure that the system
of internal control operates effectively.  In addition, as part of the audit of
the financial statements, Coopers & Lybrand completed a study and evaluation of
selected internal accounting controls to establish a basis for reliance thereon
in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests to be applied.  We
have considered the internal auditors' and Coopers & Lybrand's recommendations
concerning the system of internal control and have taken actions that we believe
are cost-effective in the circumstances to respond appropriately to these
recommendations.  We believe that as of April 30, 1994, the system of internal
control is adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed herein.
  We also recognize our responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate so
that the company's affairs are conducted according to the highest standards of
personal and corporate conduct.  This responsibility is characterized and
reflected in the company's Code of Conduct, which is publicized throughout the
company.  The Code of Conduct addresses, among other things, the necessity of
ensuring open communication within the company; disclosure of potential
conflicts of interests; compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign
laws, including those relating to financial disclosure; and maintaining the
confidentiality of proprietary information.  The company has a systematic
program to assess compliance with the Code of Conduct.
  The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, comprised solely of
directors who are not employees of the company, meets with management, the
internal auditors and the independent certified public accountants to ensure
that each is properly discharging its respective responsibilities.  Both the
independent certified public accountants and the internal auditors have free
access to the Audit Committee, without management present, to discuss the
results of their work, including internal accounting controls and the quality of
financial reporting.

                               FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
  This section supplements the consolidated financial statements beginning on 
page 24 and will assist the reader in evaluating Brown-Forman's fiscal 1994 
results of operations and financial condition.
  UNUSUAL ITEMS: Net income for fiscal 1994 contains unusual income and expense 
items. Notes 2, 5, and 6, on pages 31 and 32, discuss a $33 million charge 
resulting from the adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards  
No. 106, No. 112, and No. 116. The charge to net income from adopting these 
accounting standards was recorded as the cumulative effect of changes in 
accounting principles. Note 8, on page 34, discusses a $5 million charge 
associated with the consumer durables segment for the closing or reformatting of
certain retail stores. Note 10, on page 35, discusses an unusual charge of $3 
million for the retroactive effect of a higher tax rate on earnings from January
1, 1993 to April 30, 1993, and a noncash charge to restate the deferred tax 
liability at the new corporate tax rate. Note 3, on page 32, discusses an $18 
million gain from the sale of the company's credit card processing business. The
fiscal 1994 unusual items reflect a net $23 million reduction to net income.
  Net income for fiscal 1993 was reduced $3 million from a write-down of assets 
in the consumer durables segment.
  The following table is included to assist the reader in understanding unusual 
items:

</TABLE> 

(1) In addition, fiscal 1994 earnings per share were affected by a 1% higher tax
    rate on current earnings. Adjusted to reflect the lower statutory rate
    effective in fiscal 1993, fiscal 1994 EPS would have been $1.94 ($5.83 on a
    pre-split basis).

  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY: On January 14, 1994, the company concluded a Dutch
auction tender offer, acquiring 2,734,452 shares of Class A and 10,933,518
shares of Class B common stock at a total cost of $408 million. While interest
costs associated with the share purchase lowered net income, the purchase had a
positive effect on earnings per share, adding $.07 to fiscal 1994 results. The
company expects future earnings per share to benefit significantly by the
purchase. This benefit will be affected as the company expects to pursue several
investment strategies in fiscal 1995 that will moderate near-term earnings
growth, but help achieve greater long-term results.
  The company recorded a three-for-one stock split for all shares of Class A and
Class B common stock, paid in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend 
was distributed on May 20, 1994. All per share amounts have been retroactively 
restated to reflect the stock split.
  The company retired its treasury stock in 1994. The Consolidated Statement of 
Stockholders' Equity details the effect of this retirement.

RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS
  SALES: Net sales decreased slightly in fiscal 1994 due to lower first-half 
sales of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails and lower sales of consumer durables. 
The reduction in sales was partially offset by the full year effect of Fetzer 
Vineyards and increased international wines and spirits sales. Overseas sales 
increased from the prior year due to double-digit growth of both Jack Daniel's 
and Early Times. Consumer durables net sales declined due to significant 
reductions in sales at Lenox Collections. Excluding brands acquired, developed 
internally, sold, or eliminated, consolidated net sales were unchanged in fiscal
1994, increased 3% in fiscal 1993, and increased 2% in fiscal 1992.
  OPERATING INCOME: Operating income during fiscal 1994 decreased largely due to
lower shipments of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails in the first half of the 
year. The consumer durables segment also contributed to the decrease. Partially 
offsetting these decreases was a $2 million improvements in operating income 
from venture businesses.
  EARNINGS: Fiscal 1994 earnings were reduced by higher net interest expense 
resulting from the above mentioned stock purchase. On October 15, 1993, the 
company sold substantially all the assets of its credit card processing 
operations. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $30 million ($18 million or 
$.23 per share after tax). Additional tax expense of $3 million, or $.04 per 
share, resulted from tax legislation signed into law August 10, 1993. This 
increase recognizes the retroactive effect of a higher tax rate on earnings from
January 1, 1993 through April 30, 1993, and the recording of a noncash charge to
restate the company's deferred tax liability at the new corporate tax rate. In 
addition, tax expense, compared to prior years, increased $2 million, or $.02 
per share, from a higher statutory tax rate on fiscal 1994 earnings. Future 
earnings will also be negatively affected by these higher statutory rates. The 
company expects the effective tax rate in fiscal 1995 to be approximately 39%. 
Fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992 effective tax rates also contain benefits from 
adjustment of prior years' tax accruals.
  Excluding unusual items, earnings per share reached a record level in fiscal
1994. Earnings per share computations were positively affected by a reduction in
the average number of common shares outstanding due to the company's purchase of
2,734,452 Class A common shares and 10,933,518 Class B common shares for $408
million in fiscal 1994 and 268,500 Class B common shares for $7 million in
fiscal 1992.

  The wines and spirits business is Brown-Forman's largest segment representing
69% of net sales in 1994, 68% in 1993, and 67% in 1992. Net sales, excluding
brands which have been sold, discontinued, acquired, or developed internally
during the periods reported, increased 1% in fiscal 1994, 3% in fiscal 1993, and
decreased 1% in fiscal 1992.
  SALES: Sales outside the U.S. continued to grow to record levels. Jack 
Daniel's and Early Times experienced double-digit sales volume growth with 
increases registered in most major overseas markets. Southern Comfort sales 
volume overseas was unchanged from last year.
  Sales in fiscal 1994 were lower due to the very successful introduction of 
Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails in fiscal 1993. Typical of most successful new 
products, introductory sales of Country Cocktails in 1993 were enhanced by high 
rates of initial consumer trial and the establishment of trade inventory levels.
Although volumes for Country Cocktails moderated in fiscal 1994, it continues to
provide high margins, while broadening the consumer franchise for Jack Daniel's 
Tennessee Whiskey. Sales for the segment were increased by the full-year effect 
of Fetzer Vineyards acquired in August 1992. Canadian Mist, Southern Comfort, 
and Early Times all experienced sales volume declines in the U.S. market in 
fiscal 1994, following growth in fiscal 1993. The declines in volume primarily 
reflect consumption trends as well as a reduction of trade inventory levels.
  OPERATING INCOME: Wines and spirits operating income declined in 1994 due 
primarily to lower shipments of Country Cocktails in the first half of the year.
The decrease was partially offset by the full-year effect of Fetzer Vineyards 
and increased worldwide sales of Jack Daniel's. In 1993 the increase in 
operating income was due to the successful introduction of Jack Daniel's Country
Cocktails, overseas results, and the acquisition of Fetzer Vineyards. In 1992 
the increase in operating income was due primarily to price increases taken on 
major brands as well as international volume growth.
  ORGANIZATION: The company announced in May 1994, the creation of Brown-Forman 
Beverages Worldwide, a new global beverage organization designed to accelerate 
overseas growth for the company's beverage brands. Investments required to 
realize the full potential of this new company will moderate near-term earnings 
growth. However, these investments are expected to help the company achieve even
greater long-term results.
  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT: Concern over alcoholic beverage consumption and the
adverse societal effects of alcohol abuse has risen during the past several
years, both domestically and abroad. it is not clear how the vigorous debate
will be resolved between those who seek to preserve the traditional freedom of
adults to consume beverage alcohol responsibly and those who would restrict
consumption by various means. Despite a gradual but steady decline in alcohol
consumption by Americans over time, Brown-Forman has increased its market share,
profits and dividends by strong brand building, concentrating on premium
products, introducing new products and diversification.
  There are periodic efforts at both the federal and state levels to raise the 
already high tax rates on beverage alcohol. Recent attention has focused on the 
possibility of higher federal taxes on spirits as a possible source for funding 
health care reform. While there are no federal governmental proposals at the 
time of this writing to increase beverage alcohol taxes, if such taxes were 
imposed they would adversely affect the U.S. wines and spirits business.

  The consumer durables segment represented 31% of net sales in 1994, 31% in 
1993, and 32% in 1992. This segment includes combined results for the domestic 
and international consumer durables businesses.
  SALES: Excluding divisions acquired or divested, net sales decreased 1% in 
fiscal 1994, increased 2% in fiscal 1993, and increased 9% in fiscal 1992. Net 
sales for fiscal 1994 decreased due primarily to significantly lower sales at 
Lenox Collections, partially offset by increased sales at Lenox China and 
Hartmann Luggage. Net sales for fiscal 1993 increased primarily from the full 
year effect of the acquisition of Dansk and sales increases at Lenox Collections
and Lenox China. The increase in fiscal 1992 sales was driven by
growth at Lenox
Collections and the acquisition of Dansk in July 1991.
  OPERATING INCOME: Operating income for fiscal 1994 was reduced $8.2 million
for charges associated with closing or reformatting certain retail stores, which
will allow future efforts to concentrate on retail formats that have shown the
most promise. Excluding unusual items, operating income decreased slightly due
largely to lower sales at Lenox Collections and investments to improve
communications and logistics at Lenox.

22
<PAGE>
 
  Operating income for fiscal 1993, excluding the $3.8 million write-off of
assets associated with slow-moving and obsolete assets, decreased significantly
from 1992 due to weakened demand related to economic conditions, intense
competitive activity, higher per-unit manufacturing costs at the china
production facilities, and a diminished success rate for new product
introductions at Lenox Collections.  During 1992, the segment experienced mixed
results.  Lenox China and Lenox Collections achieved growth, which was partially
offset by start-up costs associated with opening new domestic retail leather
goods stores and expansion of china and leather products outside the U.S.

</TABLE>
  The increase in operating income in fiscal 1994 and the significant decline in
the operating loss for fiscal 1993 was primarily due to a reduction in the scope
of the company's aquaculture business and increased operating revenues from  the
company's credit card processing business.  Fiscal 1992 contained a $3.5 million
write-down of aquaculture assets.
  See Note 3, on page 32, for information related to the sale of the company's
credit card processing business during fiscal 1994. Effective November 1, 1993,
the company discontinued the use of this segment.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
  Brown-Forman's cash flow continues to provide more than adequate capital to
meet operating and capital expenditure requirements, to pay record dividends,
and to fund acquisition opportunities. See Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
on page 27.
  Cash generated from operating activities for the combined three-year period of
1992, 1993 and 1994 has been higher than amounts needed for ongoing capital
expenditure requirements, dividends, and debt repayments.  Cash requirements
have increased over the past three years reflecting the purchase of
approximately $408 million of the company's common stock, acquisition activity,
and increases in dividend payments, partially offset by reductions in working
capital, principally inventory and accounts payable.  Cash generated by
operations increased 15%, 23%, and 16% in fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.
  Net working capital excluding the sale of the company's credit card processing
business, decreased $160 million in fiscal 1994 reflecting a reduction in cash
and cash equivalents resulting from the stock purchase, lower finished goods
inventory due to successful inventory reductions in the consumer durables
segment and lower case goods of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails, and increased
accounts payable and commercial paper.  These reductions were partially offset
by an increase in barreled whisky.  Fiscal 1993 net working capital, excluding
acquisitions of businesses, increased $92 million, reflecting an increase in
cash and cash equivalents, higher accounts receivable, a reduction in short-term
debt and accrued taxes on income, partially offset by a reduction in
inventories.  Fiscal 1992 net working capital, excluding acquisitions of
businesses, decreased $5 million primarily from a decrease in cash and cash
equivalents, partially offset by higher accounts receivables due to increased
sales, and a reduction of accrued liabilities.
  The company has a $150 million revolving credit agreement that expires in
fiscal 1998 and $130 million in revolving credit agreements that expire in
fiscal 1995.  At April 30, 1994, the company had no outstanding borrowings under
these agreements.  At April 30, 1994, the company also had available for
issuance $250 million of debt securities under a shelf registration filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  The company expects to retire $100
million of 9.375% debt on April 1, 1995. However, due to a previously arranged
option to swap interest rates, the company does not expect this transaction to
result in a change in interest expense. See Note 9 on page 34.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
  Brown-Forman invested $27 million in property, plant, and equipment in fiscal
1994, $34 million in fiscal 1993, and $52 million in fiscal 1992.  Capital
expenditures are expected to be approximately $45 to $50 million in fiscal 1995
primarily for upgrading and expansion of production facilities in the wines and
spirits segment, and improving the effectiveness of Lenox operations.  Fiscal
1993 and fiscal 1992 expenditures reflect the modernization of production
facilities and projects to expand the capacity at Lenox China. In fiscal 1995,
capital expenditure requirements are expected to be met with internally
generated funds.

DIVIDENDS
  Fiscal 1994 dividends per common share were at record levels and increased 8%
to $.927 from $.86 in fiscal 1993.  The increase is based on the expectations of
continued strong and stable cash flow.  Quarterly dividends were increased in
fiscal 1994 from $.227 to $.237, which results in an indicated annual dividend
of $.947 per common share.  Cash dividends per common share increased from $.78
in 1992 to $.86 in 1993, an increase of 10%.  The percent of cash dividends paid
to net income was 58% in fiscal 1994, compared to 46% and 44% for fiscal 1993
and fiscal 1992, respectively.  Brown-Forman has paid regular cash dividends for
49 consecutive years.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A brief description of the principal accounting methods and policies follows:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries.

CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Short-term interest bearing investments are those with maturities of less than
one year but greater than three months when purchased.  These investments are
readily convertible to cash and are stated at cost, which approximates fair
value.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Approximately 84% at
April 30, 1994, 83% at April 30, 1993, and 80% at April 30, 1992 of the total
amount of consolidated inventories are stated on the basis of the last-in, 
first-out (LIFO) method. All remaining inventories generally are valued using 
the first-in, first-out and average cost methods.

  If the LIFO method had not been used, inventories would have been $71,626,000,
$62,347,000, and $45,326,000 higher than reported at April 30, 1994, 1993, and
1992, respectively.

  A substantial portion of barreled whisky will not be sold within one year
because of the duration of the aging process.  All barreled whisky is classified
in current assets in accordance with industry practice. Bulk wine inventories
are classified as work in process.

  Warehousing, insurance, ad valorem taxes, and other carrying charges
applicable to barreled whisky held for aging are included in inventory costs.

DEPRECIATION
Provision for depreciation is made on the basis of estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets, principally using the straight-line method.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets, principally the excess of purchase price over the fair value
of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses, are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization.  These assets are amortized using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding forty years.

  Intangible assets are carried at an amount not exceeding estimated
recoverability. The company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of
intangible assets based primarily on forecasted profitability and cash flows of
the related business.

DEFERRED INCOME

Deferred income represents proceeds received from a multi-year agreement for the
distribution rights of certain of the company's spirits brands in the export
market.  These proceeds are being recognized over a ten-year period.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped or services are performed.
Interchange fees, which are amounts collected for credit card issuing
organizations, are not included in revenues. These fees were $21,094,000,
$33,324,000, and $20,326,000 for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Earnings per common share are based upon the weighted average common shares
outstanding of 78,657,432 in 1994, 82,664,208 in 1993, and 82,720,695 in 1992,
after recognition of dividend requirements on preferred stock.  All common share
and per share information have been retroactively restated to reflect the three-
for-one stock split on May 20, 1994.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
year's presentation.

2.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES

On May 1, 1993, the company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  See Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions and Postemployment Benefits on page 32.  In the third quarter of 1994,
the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116,
"Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made," and restated the
first quarter as if adoption had occurred May 1, 1993. Accordingly, the company
recorded a liability for charitable contributions unconditionally pledged but
not yet paid.





  The cumulative effect of these changes in accounting principles are as follows
(in thousands).

</TABLE>

  Effective January 31, 1994, the company adopted Statement of Position 93-7,
"Reporting on Advertising Costs."  This statement was issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and requires the company to
prospectively capitalize and amortize direct-response advertising to better
match revenues with expenses.  The company continues to expense other
advertising costs as incurred.
  On May 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
  The adoption of these standards did not materially affect 1994 earnings before
the cumulative effect of accounting changes.

                                                                              31

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



3. CHANGES IN OPERATIONS

SALE OF CREDIT CARD OPERATIONS
On October 15, 1993, the company sold substantially all the assets of its 
credit card processing operations. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of 
approximately $30,077,000 ($18,350,000 or $.23 per share after-tax).

ACQUISITION OF FETZER VINEYARDS
On August 31, 1993, the company purchased the outstanding stock of Fetzer 
Vineyards of Mendocino County, California. The cost of acquiring the stock was 
approximately $64,200,000 and included, among other costs, $4,600,000 in cash, 
$47,500,000 in notes to the previous owners and four annual payments of
$2,800,000 per year beginning fiscal 1996. In addition, the company assumed
approximately $27,000,000 of Fetzer Vineyards debt. The acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the operating results of Fetzer
have been consolidated with the company since the acquisition date. The excess
of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is
approximately $47,000,000 which is being amortized over forty years.

ACQUISITION OF DANSK
The company acquired Dansk International Designs Ltd. ("Dansk") on July 2, 1991.
The total capital invested in Dansk was approximately $87,400,000, made up of 
the purchase price of acquiring all the outstanding stock for approximately 
$65,500,000, net of $2,000,000 of excess cash acquired, and the assumption of
$21,900,000 of Dansk debt. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase,
and accordingly, the operating results of Dansk have been consolidated with the
company since the acquisition date. The excess of the acquisition cost over the
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is approximately $45,800,000
which is being amortized over forty years.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS
During 1993, the company acquired a 20% interest in Swift and Moore Pty. 
Limited, an importer and marketer of spirits and wines in Australia for 
$9,512,000.
  During 1992, the company acquired certain assets of Jekel Vineyards and Wings 
Luggage. Jekel Vineyards is a Monterey County, California winery which produces 
super-premium, estate-bottled wines. These acquisitions were accounted for as 
purchases.

4. COMMITMENTS
Rentals of real estate, office and data processing equipment, vehicles, and 
manufacturing equipment under operating leases amounted to approximately 
$20,700,000, $19,200,000, and $19,000,000 for 1994, 1993, and 1992, 
respectively. The company has commitments related primarily to minimum lease 
payments totaling $22,700,000 in 1995; $16,300,000 in 1996; $13,100,000 in 1997;
$10,300,000 in 1998; $8,100,000 in 1999; and $10,100,000 after 1999.

5. POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The company provides postemployment benefits to certain former or inactive 
employees. Effective May 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment 
Benefits," which requires accrual accounting for those benefits. The cumulative 
effect of adopting this accounting standard resulted in a one-time pretax charge
of $2,817,000 ($1,713,000 or $.02 per share after tax).

6. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
The company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for 
eligible retirees. Effective May 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Under SFAS No. 106, the company 
accrues the cost of these benefits over employers' active service periods.
  The company elected to recognize this change in accounting on the immediately 
recognition basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a one-time pretax 
charge totaling $43,684,000 ($26,729,000 or $.34 per share after tax).

  The postretirement benefit expense for 1994 includes the following components 
(in thousands):

- - ------------------------------------------------------------
Accrued postretirement benefit liability             $47,223
- - ------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE> 

  The assumed discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation for April 30, 1994 was 7%. As of April 30, 1994, the assumed 
health care cost trend rate for participants under age 65 was 13.5%, for 
participants age 65 and over, the rate was 12.5%. The health care cost trend
rate was assumed to decline gradually to 5% over 10 years. A one-percentage
point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of April 30, 1994 by
$6,123,000 and the postretirement benefit expense by $834,000.

7. PENSION PLANS
The company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees.  The
benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees
pay near retirement for the salaried employees and stated amounts for each year
of service for the union and hourly employees.  The company also has unfunded
plans that provide retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan formulas or
regulatory limitations for certain employees.
   Pension income (expense) was $(1,096,000) for 1994, $347,000 for 1993, and
$1,096,000 for 1992.  Net pension income (expense) for  1994, 1993, and 1992
includes the following components (in thousands):

</TABLE>
  The projected benefit obligation was determined using a weighted average
discount rate of 7% for 1994, 8% for 1993, and 8.5% for 1992. The weighted
average rate of future compensation increases was 4% for 1994, 5% for 1993, and
5.5% for 1992.  The expected rate of return on plan assets was 9.5% for these
years.  The plans' assets consist primarily of stocks and bonds.

8. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
The company's operations have been classified into three business segments: 
wines and spirits, consumer durables, and other. The wines and spirits segment 
includes the production, importing, and marketing of wines and distilled 
spirits. The consumer durables segment includes the manufacture and sale of 
china, crystal, ceramic and crystal collectibles, silver, pewter, and luggage. 
Through October 1993, the other segment included a credit card transaction 
processing business and an aquaculture business. The credit card transaction 
processing business was sold in October 1993 and the use of this segment was 
discontinued.

</TABLE> 

     Consumer durables' operating income was reduced by $8,180,000 ($5,350,000 
after-tax) for the closing or reformatting of seven retail stores in 1994 and 
reduced by $3,830,000 ($2,500,000 after-tax) for the write-down of slow-moving 
and obsolete assets in 1993.
     There were no significant intersegment sales or transfers during 1994, 
1993, and 1992. Operating income by business segment excludes interest income, 
interest expense, and net unallocated corporate expenses. Corporate assets 
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
certain corporate receivables, and other assets.

9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The company has sold an option to swap interest rates that effectively 
eliminates the call feature and establishes a fixed interest rate on the 
$100,000,000 of notes through their maturity date, April 1, 1998. The carrying 
amount of the option represents deferred income, which will reduce interest 
expense over the term of the option.
     The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and commercial paper approximates fair value due to the short maturities of
these instruments. The value of long-term debt and the option to swap are based
on quoted market prices, discounted cash flows, and estimates of the cost to
terminate or otherwise settle. A comparison of the carrying value and fair value
of these instruments is as follows (in thousands):

     The company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce 
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. While these instruments 
are subject to the risk of loss from changes in exchange rates, these losses 
would generally be offset by related gains. The company's foreign exchange 
forward contracts on hand at April 30, 1994 and 1993 totaled $26,500,000 and 
$16,400,000, respectively. The carrying value of these financial instruments 
approximates fair value.

10. TAXES ON INCOME
Taxes on income for fiscal 1994 includes a $5,300,000 charge resulting from an 
increase in the corporate income tax rate. Included in this amount is a charge 
of $3,580,000 for the retroactive effect of a higher tax rate on earnings from 
January 1, 1993 to April 30, 1993, and a noncash charge to restate the deferred 
tax liability at the new corporate tax rate.
  The provision for taxes on income is composed of the following (in thousands):

</TABLE> 

  The 1993 deferred provision arose principally from $3,473,000 related to 
undistributed foreign earnings, $677,000 related to deferred income, partially 
offset by $2,396,000 related to intercompany transactions. The 1992 deferred 
provision arose principally from $3,284,000 related to undistributed foreign 
earnings, $2,196,000 related to deferred income, and $3,671,000 related to 
intercompany transactions. Deferred income taxes were not provided on certain 
undistributed earnings ($58,854,000 at April 30, 1994) of certain foreign 
subsidiaries because such undistributed earnings are expected to be reinvested 
indefinitely overseas. If these amounts were not considered permanently 
reinvested, additional deferred taxes of approximately $20,128,000 would have 
been provided.
  Cash paid for income taxes was $93,618,000 in 1994, $73,055,000 in 1993, and 
$67,255,000 in 1992.

debt in accordance with the company's intent and ability to refinance 
obligations on a long-term basis. Long-term debt payment requirements for the 
five fiscal years after April 30, 1994 are as follows: 1995 - $4,867,000; 1996 -
$5,414,000; 1997 - $6,023,000; 1998 - $256,581,000; 1999 - $7,455,000. Cash paid
for interest was $16,629,000 in 1994, $17,771,000 in 1993, and $12,283,000 in 
1992.

13. ENVIRONMENTAL
The company, along with other responsible parties, faces environmental claims 
resulting from the cleanup of several waste deposit sites. The company has 
accrued $2,800,000 to cover its portion of these cleanup costs. The company 
currently anticipates that all other costs of remediating these sites, estimated
at $8,200,000, are expected to be paid by other responsible parties or insurance
coverage. The company believes that any additional costs incurred by the company
will not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition or 
results of operations.

14. CREDIT FACILITIES
The company has a $150,000,000 revolving credit agreement that expires in fiscal
1998 and $130,000,000 in revolving credit agreements that expire in fiscal 1995.
At April 30, 1994, the company had no outstanding borrowings under these
agreements. The most restrictive of the agreement's covenants requires the
company to maintain a minimum level of net worth. At April 30, 1994, net worth,
as defined in the agreement, exceeded the required level by $271,347,000. At
April 30, 1994, the company also had available for issuance $250,000,000 of debt
securities under a shelf registration filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

15. CONTINGENCIES
Various suits and claims (asserted and unasserted) arising in the ordinary 
course of business are pending or threatened against the company. These include 
product liability suits against the company that allege injury from the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages and suits that allege employment 
discrimination based on the plaintiffs' age. While some of these suits and 
claims seek significant financial recoveries from the company, based on a 
considered evaluation of all known and threatened litigation, and on the advice 
of counsel, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or 
results of operations.

16. QUARTERLY RESULTS (UNAUDITED)
The 1994 and 1993 unaudited quarterly results are presented on the highlights 
page.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

BROWN-FORMAN CORPORATION

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brown-Forman 
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and the 
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows 
for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.
   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Brown-Forman
Corporation and Subsidiaries at April 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
  As discussed in Notes 2, 5, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, in
1994 the company adopted changes in its methods of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions, postemployment benefits, and contributions.
