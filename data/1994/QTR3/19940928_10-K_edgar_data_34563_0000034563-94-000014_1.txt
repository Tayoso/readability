PART I

Item 1. Business

General:  Farmer Bros. Co. (the Company or Registrant) was incorporated in
California in 1923, and is engaged in the production and sale of coffee,
spices and a variety of allied products to the institutional food service
industry.

Raw Materials and Supplies:  Coffee is the largest product in the line and is
responsible for approximately 56% of corporate revenues.  Purchasing,
roasting and packaging coffee takes place at Registrant's Torrance plant,
which is also the distribution hub for its branches.

Green coffee is purchased through commodity brokers representing foreign
suppliers.  Agricultural commodities are subject to fluctuations of both
price and supply.  Registrant has not been confronted by shortages in the
supply of green coffee, but has been faced with price fluctuations.

Trademarks & Patents:  Registrant owns approximately 23 registered U.S.
trademarks which are integral to customer identification of its products.  It
is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification.

Seasonality: Registrant experiences some seasonal influences. The winter
months are the best sales months.  Registrant's product line and geographic
diversity provides some sales stability during the summertime decline in
coffee consumption during the warmer months.

Distribution:  Registrant's products are distributed by its selling divisions
from 98 branches located in most urban centers in the western states.  The
diversity of the product line (over 300 products) and size of the area served
requires each branch to stock a sizable inventory.  Registrant maintains its
own trucking fleet to better control the supply of these warehouses.

Customers:  No single customer represents a large enough portion of sales to
have a material effect on Registrant.  The customer contact and service
quality which is integral to Registrant's sales effort is often secondary to
product pricing for customers with their own distribution systems.

Competition:  Registrant faces competition from many sources, including multi-
national firms like Procter and Gamble, Nestle and Philip Morris, grocery
distributors like Sysco and Rykoff-Sexton and regional roasters like Boyd
Coffee Co., Lingle Bros. and Royal Cup.

Registrant has some competitive advantages due to its longevity, strong
regional roots and sales and service force.  Registrant's customer base is
price sensitive and the Company is often faced with price competition.

<PAGE>
Item 1. Business, Continued

Working Capital:  Registrant makes every effort to finance operations
internally.  Management believes that working capital from internal sources
will be adequate for the coming year.  Registrant maintains a $50,000,000
line of credit with First Interstate Bank of California.  There is no
commitment fee or compensating balance requirement and the line was not used
in fiscal 1994.

Foreign Operations:  Registrant has no material revenues that result from
foreign operations.  Coffee brewing equipment is sold through distributors in
Canada and Japan and manufactured in Europe under license.

Other:  On June 30, 1994, Registrant employed 1,177 employees, 486 are
subject to collective bargaining agreements.

No material amounts have been expended on research and development for
existing or new products during the past three years.

There have been no material effects of compliance with government provisions
regulating discharge of materials into the environment.

The nature of Registrant's business does not provide for maintenance of or
reliance upon a sales backlog.

Item 2.  Properties

Registrant's largest facility is the 474,000 sq. ft. roasting plant,
warehouses and administrative offices in Torrance, California.  Registrant
believes the existing plant will continue to provide adequate production
capacity for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

Registrant is a defendant in various legal proceedings incidental to its
business which are ordinary and routine.  It is management's opinion that the
resolution of these lawsuits will have no material financial impact on the
Company.

Registrant incorporates by reference the information contained in Item 3 of
Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1992 and 1993.  The appeal of
the individual action reported therein has resolved unfavorably to
Registrant.  The costs associated with this action are not material to
Registrant's financial position and results of operations.  A reserve was
established in the year ended June 30, 1992 for these costs.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to A Vote of Security Holders

Reference is made to the information to be set forth in the section entitled
"Amendment of Bylaws" in the Proxy Statement, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Registrant continues to maintain a strong working capital position and
management believes cash requirements for the coming year will be met by
internal sources.  Registrant has no major commitments for capital
expenditures at this time, but has developed plans for construction of a new
laboratory building in its Torrance compound at an estimated cost of $2.5
million.  Construction is expected to start soon.  The Company maintains a
$50 million line of credit with First Interstate Bank of California.  There
was no bank debt incurred during fiscal 1994.

                                  1994           1993           1992

  Quick ratio                     4.76:1         7.77:1         4.65:1

Capital Expenditures            $  6,658       $  5,388       $  6,967

Results of Operations

Net sales increased 1.7% to $193,861,000 in 1994 as compared to $190,679,000
in 1993, but remained below 1992 sales of $197,312,000.  Although some
segments of the national economy are improving, Registrant notes little
improvement in the restaurant and hospitality business in its service area.
The California economy, in particular, has shown little sign of improvement
during fiscal 1994.

Gross profit decreased 17.5% to $94,295,000 in 1994 as compared to
$114,258,000 in 1993 and $112,394,000 in 1992.  The volatile world market for
green coffee had a negative impact on Registrant's operations in fiscal 1994.
Speculation about a perceived world shortage of coffee, followed by two
Brazilian frosts in June and July pushed green coffee prices to eight year
highs.  The cost of green coffee more than doubled by year end, and
Registrant was unable to raise prices fast enough to accommodate the
increased costs.  The rapid erosion of margins has a direct impact on net
profit, resulting in a net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 1994 of
($2,163,000) or ($1.13) per share, as compared to a net profit of $6,640,000
or $3.45 per share in the same quarter of fiscal 1993 and a net profit of
$3,325,000 or $1.73 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992.  Net
income for 1994 decreased 45.5% to $10,330,000 or $5.36 per share from
$18,950,000 or $9.84 per share in 1993 and $20,226,000 or $10.50 per share in
1992.  The green coffee market is too volatile to reliably forecast future
coffee costs, and Registrant cautions against using past results to predict
future earnings.  Operating expenses were even with prior years, reaching
$84,807,000 or $.44 per share in 1994 as compared to $84,329,000 or $.44 per
share in 1993 and $84,900,000 or $.44 per share in 1992.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, Continued

Increased compensation, medical and coffee brewing equipment costs were
offset by reduced legal fees and insurance costs.

<PAGE>



Inflation
The Company's operations are significantly impacted by the world market for
green coffee.  Coffee is an agricultural product and its price fluctuates as
the result of many factors beyond Registrant's control, including the actions
of our own and foreign governments, the weather in coffee producing nations
and the operation of the commodity futures markets.  Management cautions
against using past results to predict future earnings.

SFAS No. 115
Registrant has not adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  SFAS 115 requires certain
changes in accounting for investments in equity and debt securities.  The
Company is required to adopt this standard for the fiscal year beginning July
1, 1994.  Registrant does not believe the adoption of SFAS 115 will have a
material impact on its financial position.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Farmer Bros. Co. and Subsidiary

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of Farmer Bros. Co. and Subsidiary ("the Company") as
listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.  These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as
of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be
included therein.

As discussed in Notes F and G to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other
than pensions and income taxes in 1993.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiary FBC Finance Company.  All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 30
days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, which approximate market.

Investments
Marketable equity securities are carried at the lower of cost or market.  A
valuation allowance is included in shareholders' equity that represents any
net unrealized loss from non current investments.  Other investments are
carried at amortized cost which approximates market.  The cost of investments
sold is determined on the specific identification method.  Fair value of
investments are based on quoted market prices.  Dividend and interest income
are accrued as earned.

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Costs of coffee and
allied products are determined on the Last In, First Out (LIF0) basis.  Costs
of coffee brewing equipment manufactured are accounted for on the First In,
First Out (FIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated deprecia
tion.  Depreciation of buildings and facilities is computed using the
straight-line method.  Other assets are depreciated using primarily the sum-
of-the-years' digits method.  The following useful lives are used:

     Buildings and facilities            10 to 30 years
     Machinery and equipment              3 to  5 years
     Office furniture and equipment             5 years

When assets are sold or retired the asset and related depreciation allowance
is eliminated from the records and any gain or loss on disposal is included
in operations.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, betterments
are capitalized.

Income Taxes
In 1994 and 1993, deferred income taxes are determined based on the
difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
differences are expected to reverse.  In 1992, the provision for deferred
income taxes represents the tax effect of differences in the timing of income
and expense recognition for financial reporting and tax purposes.

* Represents carrying value.

A valuation allowance for preferred stocks of approximately $1,044,000 was
recorded at June 30, 1994.

Net realized gains (losses) on the sale of investments were $1,758,000,
$3,552,000, and $(422,000) in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

The Company has not adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  SFAS 115 requires certain
changes in accounting for investments in equity and debt securities.  The
Company is required to adopt this standard for the fiscal year beginning July
1, 1994.  The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 115 will have a
material impact on its financial position.

The assets of each plan are primarily invested in publicly traded stocks and
bonds, U.S. government securities and money market funds.  The Farmer Bros.
Co. Retirement Plan owned 21,765 shares of the Company's common stock at June
30, 1994 and 1993 with a fair value of approximately $2,677,000 and
$3,287,000, respectively.

The Company contributes to two-multi-employer defined benefit plans for
certain union employees.  The contributions to these multi employer pension
plans were approximately $1,615,000, $1,610,000, and $1,448,000 for 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.  The Company also has a defined contribution
plan for eligible non-union employees.  No Company contributions have been
made nor required to be made to this plan.

The Company incurred health care and life insurance costs, for both active
employees and retirees, of approximately $4,114,000, $3,665,000 and
$4,305,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
In 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106 ("SFAS 106"), "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions."  SFAS 106 requires the accrual method of accounting for these
benefits rather than the Company's previous policy of recording these
benefits when paid.  The Company recognized the Accumulated Postretirement
Benefit Obligation as of July 1, 1992 of $8,130,000.  On an after-tax basis,
the cumulative effect of this charge was $4,901,000 or $2.55 per share.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost charged to operations for the years
ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 includes the following components:

                                                1994           1993
                                                  (In thousands)
     Service cost benefits earned
        during the year                        $  496         $  457
     Interest cost on accumulated
       postretirement benefit obligation          756            681
     Total expense                             $1,252         $1,138

At June 30, 1994 and 1993, the recorded liability for these postretirement
benefits was as follows:

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:
                                                1994           1993
                                                  (In thousands)

     Retirees and dependents                   $ 5,276        $ 4,046
     Fully eligible active participants          3,300          2,913
     Other active participants                   2,030          2,066
     Accumulated postretirement
       benefit obligation                       10,606          9,025
     Unrecognized net loss                        (596)             -
     Accrued postretirement benefit cost       $10,010        $ 9,025

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at June 30, 1994 and 1993 was 8% and 8.5%, respectively.  The
health care cost trend rate was assumed to be 10% in 1994 and 1993 grading to
5.5% in ten years for medical and 6% for all years for dental.

An increase in the health care cost trend rate of 1% in each year would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30,
1994 by 8.3% and increase the aggregate of service and interest cost for 1994
by 8.7%.

G. Income Taxes

Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 resulted in a charge of $393,000 or
$.20 per share.

The Company is a party to various pending legal and administrative pro
ceedings.  It is management's opinion that the outcome of such proceedings
will have no material financial impact on the Company.

Concentration of Credit Risk:  At June 30, 1994, financial instruments which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of
cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions (which periodically
exceed federally insured limits) and investments in the preferred stocks of
other companies.  Other investments are in U.S. government securities.
Investment in the preferred stocks of other companies are limited to high
quality issuers and are not concentrated by geographic area or issuer.
