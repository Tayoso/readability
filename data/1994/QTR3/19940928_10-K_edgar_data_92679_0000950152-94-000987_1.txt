PART I
- - ------
Item l.   Business
- - -------   --------


     Except as otherwise indicated, the term "Company" refers to Sparton
Corporation, and the term "Sparton" refers to Sparton Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries.


     The Company has been in continuous existence since 1900.  It was last
reorganized in 1919 as an Ohio corporation.  Sparton operates in two principal
business segments.  The major products of both industry segments and selected
data are included in the Annual Report in Note 10, Segment Information, of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 17 and 18 and are
incorporated herein by reference.  Additional information about each segment is
as follows.


Electronics
- - -----------

     Historically, the electronics segment's principal product has been
sonobuoys, which are anti-submarine warfare devices used by the U.S.  Navy and
other free world military organizations.  According to publicly available
government procurement data, Sparton has historically been one of two leading
manufacturers of sonobuoys in the United States.  It competes with a limited
number of qualified manufacturers for sonobuoy procurements by the U.S. and
selected foreign governments.  Contracts are obtained through competitive bid
or directed procurement.  U.S.  government contracts normally include
termination provisions which allow the government to cancel contracts at its
election.  Termination clauses generally provide, however, a mechanism for the
contractor to recoup some or all of the costs previously incurred.  U.S.
government contracts also generally include provisions for progress billings





                                      -1-
<PAGE>   3
based upon contract costs incurred, which reduce the amount of working capital
otherwise required to perform such contracts.


     The electronics segment also designs and/or manufactures a variety of
electronic and electromechanical products for the telecommunications,
electronics and other industries.  Competitive factors in these markets include
technical ability, customer service and price.  A majority of the proprietary
products, principally transducers and monitoring systems, are sold to the
telecommunications industry.  The primary industries of the Company's contract
manufacturing business include telecommunications and health care.  In the
general contract manufacturing business, it must compete vigorously with a
number of manufacturers.  Commercial electronics products are distributed
through a direct sales force and through a small group of distributors.


     At June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993, the aggregate backlog was
approximately $90 million and $93 million, respectively.  A majority of the
1994 backlog is expected to be realized in fiscal 1995.


     The Company's sales of sonobuoys, principally to the U.S. Navy, have
declined dramatically from $151,024,000 in 1992 to $47,645,000 in 1994,
reflecting overall changes in the U.S. Navy's budget.  Based on current
information, it is expected that the U.S. Navy's budget for production
sonobuoys for the foreseeable future will continue at reduced levels.  The Navy
is funding development efforts to improve the detection capability of current
systems and to implement new detection systems for planned deliveries starting
in 1996.  The Company is currently developing certain of these new systems both
individually and jointly with a major competitor.  At the present time, the
Company is uncertain as to the market potential of these new





                                      -2-
<PAGE>   4
systems, and if it would be the supplier of choice if these systems go to
production.  The international market for sonobuoys has also been adversely
impacted by reduced budgets.  As most foreign governments use sonobuoys for
training and do not maintain the same high level of reserves of the U.S. Navy,
the reductions in the international market presently experienced and expected
in the future should be less severe.  In response to this changing environment,
the Company has previously consolidated certain of its manufacturing
facilities, continues to reduce costs within the defense-oriented operations
and is developing commercial opportunities which will utilize its existing
technological and manufacturing capabilities.   In addition, the Company is
focusing on expanding sales in its automotive and other commercial electronics
markets on a worldwide basis.  Management, however, cannot predict the level of
U.S. sonobuoy awards it will receive over the next several years, the growth in
sales volume of new commercial business intended to replace these declining
defense revenues, nor the resulting financial impact of these changes on the
Company's operations.  As with any change of this magnitude, unexpected delays
in new program start-ups and their associated cost impacts frequently occur.
Investors should be aware of this uncertainty and make their own independent
evaluation.

Automotive and Industrial Products
- - ----------------------------------

     The automotive and industrial products segment produces a variety of
automatic floors shifters, horns, metal airbag components, spare tire carriers,
and stampings and assemblies for manufacturers of automobiles, trucks and other
industrial and marine equipment.  Competition in these markets is generally
based upon product quality, customer service and price.  Based on information
provided by automobile manufacturers, the Company is believed to be one of the
largest independent manufacturers of automatic floor shifters and horns in the
United States.  It is also one of numerous suppliers of automotive stampings.
Sales are generally obtained on a competitive basis through either a direct
sales force or manufacturers' representatives.





                                      -4-
<PAGE>   6






Other Information
- - -----------------

     Sparton's two principal business markets are dependent on a limited number
of customers and the loss of any one of them could have a materially adverse
financial effect.  Materials for the manufacturing segments are obtained from a
variety of sources.  While Sparton holds a number of patents relating to its
products and processes, none are considered of material importance to any of
the individual business segments.  Neither of the business segments have
encountered or expect to encounter significant problems in obtaining sufficient
raw materials.  While sales fluctuate during the year, such fluctuations have
not historically reflected a definitive seasonal pattern or tendency.


     Research and development expenditures amounted to approximately
$19,621,000 in 1994, $18,511,000 in 1993 and $24,556,000 in 1992 (approximately
$16,197,000, $15,155,000 and $21,885,000 of these expenditures, respectively,
were customer funded), primarily in the electronics segment.  There are
approximately 260 employees involved in research and development.  Few, if any,
devote all of their time to such efforts.


     Sparton employed approximately 2,300 people at June 30, 1994.  The Company
has one operating division and eight wholly-owned subsidiaries.



Item 2.   Properties
- - -------   ----------

     The table below lists the principal properties of Sparton, by segment.
All are owned except as noted.  There are manufacturing and/or office
facilities at each





                                      -5-

location.  Sparton believes these facilities are suitable for its operations,
except as noted.

     Electronics:
          Jackson, Michigan
          DeLeon Springs, Florida (2 plants)
          Brooksville, Florida
          London, Ontario
          Albuquerque, New Mexico
          Rio Rancho, New Mexico
          Deming, New Mexico (lease/purchase, see below)

     Automotive and industrial products:
          Flora, Illinois
          Grayville, Illinois (2 plants, one of which is leased)
          Lake Odessa, Michigan
          Kentwood, Michigan (leased)
          Gladwin, Michigan
          Grand Haven, Michigan (in part leased)
          White Cloud, Michigan (in part leased)
          Spring Lake, Michigan
          Brownstown, Indiana
          Hartford City, Indiana


     The Company leases the Deming, New Mexico facility under terms of a
capital lease and has exercised an option to purchase the facility at the end
of the lease term which expires on July 1, 1997.  Future minimum payments under
this capital lease at June 30, 1994 are as follows: 1995 - $89,000, 1996 -
$85,000, 1997 - $80,000, and $75,000 in 1998.  Interest of $29,000, payable
over the remaining lease term at 6 1/8% per annum, was deducted in arriving at
the obligation at June 30, 1994.  In July 1991, the Company leased an
additional production facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico under a four-year
agreement.  This facility is presently vacant and available for sublease.


     Both the White Cloud, Michigan and Grand Haven, Michigan facilities are
occupied under lease agreements that allow termination by either party upon
ninety (90) day notice.  These facilities are owned by John J. Smith and Lawson
K. Smith, Chief





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   8
Executive Officer, and Vice President-Secretary, respectively, of Sparton
Corporation.  The agreements, the result of arms-length type negotiations,
grant the Company the option to acquire the properties during the lease term
for $252,400 and $223,200, respectively.


     The adminitrative facility in Kentwood, Michigan is presently leased under
an agreement that expires in October, 1997.  The Company officially closed the
Gladwin plant of Sparton Engineered Products, Inc.-Lake Odessa Group in August
1990 with this property subsequently offered for sale.  The Gladwin facility
was placed back in service in October 1993 and is no longer actively offered
for sale.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings
- - ------    -----------------

     Various litigation is pending against the Company, in many cases involving
ordinary and routine claims incidental to the business of the Company and in
others presenting allegations that are non-routine.  The Company and its
subsidiaries are also involved in certain compliance issues with the United
States Environmental Protection Agency and various state agencies, including
being named as a potentially responsible party at several sites.  Potentially
responsible parties can be held jointly and severally liable for the cleanup
costs at any specific site.  The Company's past experience, however, has
indicated that when it has contributed only deminimus amounts of material or
waste to a specific site, its ultimate share of any cleanup costs has been very
small.  Based upon available information, the Company believes it has
contributed only deminimus amounts to those sites in which it is currently
viewed a potentially responsible party.

     One of the Company's facilities located in New Mexico has been the subject
of ongoing investigations by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
To date, the work has involved remedial investigations, negotiation and
execution of an administrative order on consent with the EPA, establishment of
on-site and off-site monitoring systems, and the installation of some
groundwater recovery and air stripping equipment.  The remedial investigation
has been completed and approved.  The Company has prepared a corrective action
plan based upon the results of its investigation.  This action plan has not yet
been approved.  In addition, the Company is involved in related issues with
State of New Mexico environmental agencies and a nearby landowner.  The
Company has charged to expense approximately $2,700,000, net of $3,000,000 of
insurance recoveries received, since the contamination problem was first
identified in the early 1980's.  Efforts to resolve thses matters will likely
continue for a number of years.



                                      -7-
<PAGE>   9
The ultimate legal and financial liability of the Company in respect to the
above matters cannot be estimated with any certainty.  Management of the
Company believes, however, based on its examination of such matters, experience
to date and discussions with counsel and other consultants, that such ultimate
liability (including insurance recoveries, where applicable) should not be
material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Item 4.     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
- - ------      ---------------------------------------------------

     No matters were submitted to a vote of the security holders during the
last quarter of the period covered by this report.

SHAREOWNERS' LETTER
 
            
September 29, 1994
            
TO OUR SHAREOWNERS:
 
Fiscal year 1994 represented the completion of another year of transition for
Sparton as it moves from its previous major orientation as a defense
contractor to a company whose emphasis is focused on the commercial marketplace.
We had hoped to complete this transition in three to five years and to remain
profitable while doing so. However, this was not possible this past year.
 
From 1992 to 1994, Sparton's government-related sales declined $115 million.
Using historical averages, these sales would have generated before-tax profits
of approximately $13 million. Our efforts to replace the declining defense
business have been fruitful but not at a rate commensurate with the dollar
decline in defense. Sparton's strategic focus remains on the growing electronics
contract manufacturing marketplace as well as our historic emphasis on 
automotive and telecommunications.
 
During fiscal 1994, we booked $50 million in new commercial electronics contract
manufacturing business, $29 million in new automotive business and $7 million in
new telecommunications business. Additionally, we were able to acquire a new
proprietary telecommunications product called "The Receptionist(TM)" for
Sparton Technology, Inc. in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. This product is an
automatically attended telephone routing device designed to be sold 
internationally for use in small offices and homes.
 
At this writing, all of our U.S. and Canadian electronics manufacturing plants
are ISO 9000 registered and the balance of our facilities have plans in place to
achieve registration.
 
ELECTRONICS
 
The electronics contract manufacturing market in North America is now estimated
to be about $8.4 billion yearly. It is forecast to grow to $16.5 billion by
1997. Some of the reasons for this dramatic growth are:
 
     - Vertical integration in some areas of manufacturing is declining;
 
     - Electronics' product life cycles average about 16 months; and
 
     - High output manufacturing infrastructure is too expensive for many
       companies to put in place on a timely basis.
 
Sparton is now recognized as a viable competitor in this market. We have
several competitive advantages which we can continue to exploit. Our profit
margins from electronics contract manufacturing were unsatisfactory in 1994, but
are showing improvement. Our learning curve experience in commercial 
electronics has been longer than anticipated, principally due to the very 
different disciplines required of the management organization in commercial 
manufacturing environments. We expect that this area will contribute 
meaningful earnings to Sparton in 1995.
 
Business at Sparton Technology Inc. (STI) declined during 1994 due to the
loss of its defense-related business, delays in some important
telecommunications-related orders and the follow-on effect of the loss of a
major contract with a contractor to the U.S. Postal Service. STI should
experience a return to profitable operations in fiscal year 1995. Higher sales 
from the commercial marketplaces should replace nearly all of STI's lost defense
business.
 
AUTOMOTIVE AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
 
Sparton's automotive sales passed $100 million for the first time in the
Company's history. However, margins from this activity were unsatisfactory. 
This was due to inadequate pricing on several key product lines coupled with 
manufacturing inefficiencies and cost overruns related to quality issues, new 
program launches and capacity constraints. All of these issues are currently 
being addressed and positive results from these actions should be forthcoming.
 
Supplier consolidation continues within the automotive Original Equipment
Manufacturing (OEM) business. We expect that large Tier 1 supplier companies
will get larger and that small

<PAGE>   5
 
companies will be eliminated or assigned to Tier 2 status in future years.
Today, a Tier 1 supplier to the automotive OEM business has no future without
an engineering support base. Fortunately, Sparton has been able to maintain 
its engineering excellence and is experiencing continuing new business
opportunities both in North America and in Europe.
 
SPARTON'S FUTURE
 
While Sparton's business remains in a difficult and somewhat unpredictable
transition phase, we have been and will continue to be rewarded with substantial
new business opportunities in all of our chosen fields. These will arise due to
our technical competence and our reputation as a producer of low cost, high 
quality products for industry worldwide.
 
We wish to express our appreciation to our employees for their dedication and
hard work and to our shareowners for their continued support during this
transition period. We believe that our best years are in our future, not a part
of our past. It is our goal to demonstrate to you that we are correct.
 
Our Annual Meeting is scheduled for 10:00 A.M. on Wednesday, October 26, 1994 in
our Jackson, Michigan Board Room. We trust that many of you will find it
possible to attend.
 
Yours truly,
 
JOHN J. SMITH

                      Sparton Electronics
 
Sparton Electronics completed the third year of its planned transition from
being a defense contractor to becoming primarily a commercial electronics
engineering and manufacturing firm. The unit continued to develop full service
contract manufacturing support for its principal customers. These customers
represent a sizable commercial business opportunity in the industrial process
control, data communications, telecommunications and medical devices fields.
Sparton Electronics offers significant technical resources to support customers
by redesigning existing products and then cost-effectively manufacturing them.
The group can also assist by bringing their customers' products, featuring the
latest in electronic and electromechanical technologies, to the marketplace in a
timely manner.
 
In years one and two of this conversion process, the group spent considerable
time analyzing business opportunities with the assistance of an outside
consulting firm. The resulting Business Plan is still intact and feedback has
been very positive. Progress, however, has been slower than initially
anticipated. Several new commercial customers were obtained this past year.
Sparton Electronics is now recognized as a viable source for full service
contract manufacturing work. This unit continues to solicit new customers and
expand its business base with existing customers.
 
An important milestone was achieved in 1994. All three Sparton Electronics'
facilities received formal ISO 9000 certification of their business systems.
This designation has become a prerequisite for a number of commercial customers.
 
Sales of governmental products, principally sonobuoys, declined substantially,
but still provided over one-half of Sparton Electronics' sales during the past
year. Commercial business accounted for 42% of 1994 sales and should constitute
60% in 1995. A loss was incurred in 1994 due to the termination of several
commercial contracts and the writedowns in value of certain governmental and
commercial inventories.
 
A significant sonobuoy production program started very slowly due to extensive
design testing required by the U.S. Navy. Approval was obtained and the program
should be substantially completed in the first quarter of 1995. During the year,
one production and three developmental sonobuoy contracts were received from the
U.S. Navy. Sparton Electronics secured 80% of the market share of 1994
international sonobuoy production awards for which they competed. U.S.
Government 1995 sonobuoy requirements are expected to increase versus 1994, but
the long-term outlook is uncertain.
 
The electronic pager business has been very slow to develop. A one-way
communications device that receives its signal from FM radio stations, this
pager and its related system design is now fully functional. Sparton's business
development staff is aggressively pursuing pager opportunities worldwide.

                    SPARTON OF CANADA, LTD.
                    .........................

   [PHOTO]            MARK W. PICKARD
                      Vice President-
                      General Manager
                      Sparton of Canada, Ltd.

In 1994, Sparton of Canada (SOC) continued its diversification effort to develop
a significant commercial product line. Sales declined 60% versus the previous
year and a loss was incurred. Significant work force reductions were completed
during the year.
 
Operational highlights included ISO 9001 registration and the receipt of the
U.S. Defense General Supply Center (DGSC) Quality Vendor Award of Excellence.
The award was presented to SOC when it met the Center's stringent quality, price
and delivery requirements on solid state, high-voltage power supplies.
 
Results were mixed for the bathythermograph business. These air-, ship-, and
submarine-launched devices measure ocean temperatures as they descend in the
water. This product line has earned wide international customer acceptance, but
defense cuts and budget-related acquisition delays resulted in lower than
anticipated sales.
 
Sparton of Canada delivered a Deployable Acoustic Calibration System (DACS) to
the Canadian Navy during 1994. This represents the first sale of a full naval
system with proprietary technology. DACS has the potential for international
sales once in service in Canada. Furthermore, an SOC Free Flooded Ring (FFR)
sonar projector completed significant demonstration trials. FFR technology,
having achieved worldwide recognition, is being seriously considered by a
foreign navy. International interest in this proprietary product is growing
rapidly.
 
Progress was made in commercial diversification. The Sparton Marine Products'
Temperature Profiling System (TiPS(TM)) made a successful debut. This
bathythermograph system for the worldwide commercial fisheries industry is
expected to show continued growth as user acceptance continues. More
importantly, efforts were initiated to establish a Canadian-based regional
presence for contract manufacturing services. This resulted in a number of new
customer contacts. One contract was completed to design and produce a custom
power supply for an expanding Canadian wastewater treatment firm.

Sales at Sparton Technology, Inc. (STI) declined in 1994 and a small loss was
incurred. Sales of defense-related products declined substantially and its
contract manufacturing of wiring harnesses, support frames and electronic
products for a prime contractor to the U.S. Postal Service ended.
 
Proprietary product sales remained solid. STI completed its first major sale of
cable pressure monitoring equipment to Mexico. In addition, a PowerComTM power
management system was sold there. PowerComTM systems are installed in
telecommunications companies' central and satellite

offices to monitor and control electric power. Mainland China continued to
purchase pressure monitoring equipment during the year. These purchases,
together with a variety of other international contracts, have pushed export
sales to over 25% of total sales at STI. Interest in power and battery
monitoring equipment continues to grow both in the U.S. and overseas due to
personnel reductions at the telephone companies. Several large proposals for
proprietary products are pending with major telecommunications companies.
 
STI received the 1994 Governor's New Engineering Product award from the State of
New Mexico. The recognition was given for the design, development, production
and distribution of its 5353 Battery Monitoring system.
 
Bus wiring harness and electronics revenues increased notably during 1994. This
business shows good long-term potential. Remote Utility Meter Reading was a
disappointment to Sparton Technology as ongoing market tests have yet to result
in a production order. This is not seen as a significant product for the
near-term.
 
A significant development contract was received from a Fortune 500 company for
tone alert receivers. These emergency alarm receivers will be placed in
residences, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, businesses and other key
facilities located near chemical stockpiles. Prototypes of these Chemical
Stockpile Preparedness Program (CSEPP) receivers are to be delivered in the
first quarter of 1995. A follow-on production contract is possible.
 
STI has acquired the rights to The ReceptionistTM, an automatically attended
telephone routing switcher. This device, developed by a New York firm, is
intended for use by small businesses, home offices and consumers. There is the
potential to develop a complete line of related products.

                      KPI Group

Fiscal 1994 featured record sales and steady profits at Sparton Engineered
Products, Inc. - KPI Group (KPI). The increase in sales was attributable to
greater new vehicle sales and new product launches of automatic transmission
shifters, undercarriage spare tire carriers, metal airbag inflator bodies and
reaction canisters. The unit's two-year 90% sales growth, however, created
manufacturing difficulties that reduced profitability. A very competitive labor
market added unanticipated expenses relating to turnover and training.
Engineering and manufacturing problems on a new airbag program resulted in
significant additional costs. Increased demands in customer requirements added
costs for technical support, warranty analysis and management of KPI's
suppliers. Margins were also adversely impacted by previously agreed-to price
reductions contained in a long-term agreement with a major customer, higher than
expected costs of a new European shifter program and several engineering changes
to existing products.
 
Significant capital expenditures were made to accommodate future growth. A
manufacturing plant was purchased in Hartford City, Indiana. Production
shipments from this facility began in the first quarter of 1995. Administrative
space at the Grand Haven, Michigan headquarters was doubled due to the necessary
increase in KPI's support staff.
 
New production items for 1995 include one parking brake, three shifters, one
spare tire carrier and five metal airbag components.
 
The largest new shifter contract is for the North American versions of a major
customer's World Car. KPI already ships similar shifters to Europe for the
customer's related models.

                      Lake Odessa Group

Sparton Engineered Products, Inc. - Lake Odessa Group (Lake Odessa) reported an
operating loss on a modest increase in sales revenues. A major expense was
incurred when its leased administrative and manufacturing center was closed
early in 1994 and a replacement production facility was reopened at Gladwin,
Michigan. The administrative and engineering center was relocated to another
leased facility in Kentwood, Michigan.
 
Operating margins were negatively impacted by continued competitive pricing
pressures and selected raw material price increases. Additional unanticipated
expenses were incurred due to the start-up of a new brake/accelerator pedal
program.
 
Lake Odessa was awarded a large contract for a brake pedal module on a new
customer's remodeled minivan. Production is scheduled to start in January 1995.
This customer has also added Lake Odessa to its long-term supplier program,
allowing it to participate in advanced vehicle design programs.
 
Lake Odessa continues to develop its capabilities to compete in today's
worldwide marketplace. The organization is actively pursuing new opportunities
with several international automobile companies.

                      Flora Group

The strong North American automotive marketplace and several new horn contracts
boosted sales at Sparton Engineered Products, Inc. - Flora Group (Flora) during
the year. This increase required the addition of a third shift and a seven day
production schedule for most of the second half of the year.
 
The city of Flora, Illinois developed a severe labor shortage in 1994 due to the
rapid expansion in employment at several automotive suppliers in the area. As
these suppliers competed for a limited labor market, Flora Group and the others
were forced to hire temporary employees. The combination of an added third
shift, seven day a week production and temporary employees resulted in higher
production costs than were anticipated. This situation, plus the lack of
resolution of several pricing issues, led to a loss for the year.
 
In light of the Flora labor market and the need for added production capacity to
fulfill horn demand, a decision was made to add a second production line at its
plant in Grayville, Illinois. This new line is to be at full production in
October 1994.
 
Contract manufacturing of telecommunications products increased significantly in
1994 and is anticipated to experience added growth over the next several years.
 
A limited capacity electronic horn production line was completed and small
quantities of these horns have been shipped to customers. Both the seashell and
vibrator versions of the World ClassTM electronic horn have successfully passed
required tests for European Economic Community (EEC) and United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE) registration approvals. These approvals clear the
way for European sales and distribution.
 
New business opportunities for both electromechanical and electronic horns are
being actively pursued internationally by Flora Group.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
            The Board of Directors and Shareowners
            Sparton Corporation
 
            We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
            Sparton Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993,
            and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareowners'
            equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
            ended June 30, 1994. These financial statements are the
            responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
            express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
            audits.
 
            We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
            auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
            the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
            statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
            examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
            disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
            assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
            made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
            statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
            reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
            In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
            fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
            position of Sparton Corporation and subsidiaries at June 30, 1994
            and 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
            cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
            1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
            As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in the year
            ended June 30, 1994, the Company changed its methods of accounting
            for income taxes and postemployment benefits.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
            SPARTON CORPORATION & SUBSIDIARIES
 
            1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
            BASIS OF PRESENTATION -- The consolidated financial statements
            include the accounts of Sparton Corporation and all subsidiaries.
            All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
            eliminated.
 
            CONTRACT ACCOUNTING -- Long-term contracts relate principally to
            government defense and commercial contracts within the Electronics
            segment. Production contracts are accounted for based on completed
            units shipped and their estimated average contract cost per unit.
            Development contracts are accounted for based on percentage
            completion. Costs and fees billed under cost reimbursement type
            contracts are recorded as sales.
 
            CREDIT PRACTICES -- The Company manufactures and sells products
            principally in the commercial electronics, defense and automotive
            manufacturing industries. Credit terms are granted and periodically
            revised based on evaluations of the customers' financial condition
            with collateral generally not required. Receivables from foreign
            customers are generally secured by letters of credit. Credit losses
            relating to customers consistently have been within management's
            expectations and comparable to losses incurred by organizations
            similar to the Company.
 
            INVENTORIES -- Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
            (first-in, first-out basis) or market.
 
            DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION -- Depreciation is provided over
            estimated useful lives on accelerated methods, except for certain
            buildings, machinery and equipment with an aggregate cost of
            approximately $13,404,000 at June 30, 1994, which are being
            depreciated on the straight-line method.
 
            TREASURY STOCK -- The excess of cost over par value allocated to
            capital in excess of par value of shares acquired for the treasury
            is based on the per share amount of capital in excess of par value
            for all shares, with the difference charged to retained earnings.
 
            RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES -- Expenditures for research
            and development not funded by customers amounted to approximately
            $3,424,000 in 1994, $3,356,000 in 1993, and $2,671,000 in 1992.
 
            EARNINGS PER SHARE -- Earnings per share are computed using the
            weighted average number of common shares outstanding of 7,810,721 in
            1994, 7,800,543 in 1993 and 7,791,672 in 1992. Inclusion of
            outstanding stock options in the computation would not result in any
            significant dilution.
 
            CHANGES IN METHODS OF ACCOUNTING -- Effective the first quarter of
            1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under this
            method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
            differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
            liabilities. They are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
            that will be in effect when such differences are expected to
            reverse. Prior years' financial statements have not been restated to
            apply the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and, accordingly, reflect the
            deferred method. Under the deferred method, deferred income tax
            provisions were made for all timing differences between earnings for
            financial reporting and income tax purposes. The adoption of SFAS
            No. 109 has not changed the actual amount of income tax paid by the
            Company. The cumulative effect of this accounting change was to
            decrease the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1994 by
            $264,000 ($.03 per share).
 
            In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company elected to early adopt
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
            Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," retroactively as of July 1,
            1993. Under this new method of accounting, the Company accrues
            disability benefits when it becomes probable that such benefits will
            be paid and when sufficient information exists to make reasonable
            estimates of the amounts to be paid. Prior to adoption, the Company
            recognized the cost of providing these benefits on a cash basis.
            Prior years' financial statements have not been restated. The
            cumulative effect of this accounting change was to increase the net
            loss for the first quarter of 1994 by $264,000 ($.03 per share), net
            of income taxes of $149,000. The effect of this accounting change on
            1994 operations was not material.
 






            2. LONG-TERM CONTRACTS
 
            Inventories include costs related to long-term contracts of
            approximately $23,439,000 and $38,970,000 at June 30, 1994 and 1993,
            respectively, reduced by progress billings from the United States
            Government of approximately $5,627,000 and $6,900,000, respectively.
 
            Accounts payable includes billings in excess of costs of $1,236,000
            and $6,995,000 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
            3. SHORT-TERM LOANS AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY
 
            At June 30, 1994, the Company has unsecured, informal lines of
            credit totalling $26,500,000 with three separate banks. At June 30,
            1994, $20,000,000 was outstanding under these agreements. The
            Company's Canadian subsidiary maintains a revolving credit facility
            (the Facility) with a Canadian bank for borrowings up to $723,000.
            The Facility is unsecured and due on demand. At June 30, 1994,
            $615,000 was outstanding under this Facility.
 
                                                                            13

            and 1992, respectively. Commitments under these leases are not
            significant.
 
            5. STOCK OPTIONS
 
            The Company has an incentive stock option plan under which 400,000
            common shares were reserved for option grants to key employees at
            the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant. Under
            the plan, the options generally become exercisable cumulatively,
            beginning one year after the date granted, in equal annual
            installments. Individual grants may have a stock appreciation rights
            feature whereby optionees can surrender up to one-half of their
            unexercised options to the extent then exercisable in exchange for
            cash or common shares equal to the difference between the then
            current market value and the option prices for shares issuable upon
            surrender of such options. In addition, the plan permits the Company
            to award restricted stock to eligible employees, providing the
            recipient with limited ability to sell or otherwise transfer the
            restricted shares.
 
            Information on options is as follows:

            At June 30, 1994 there were 286,400 shares reserved for option
            grants and 60,172 share options exercisable which expire in 1995
            through 1999. The remaining 51,428 share options outstanding become
            exercisable beginning in 1995 and expire through 1999.
 






            6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
 
            The Company has a contributory pension plan for the benefit of
            certain salaried and hourly employees. Basic plan benefits are based
            upon the participants' years of service. Additional benefits are
            available to contributory participants based upon their years of
            contributory service and compensation. The Company's policy is to
            fund the plan based upon legal requirements and tax regulations.
 
            The following major assumptions were used in the actuarial
            valuations:

            The Company also maintains several contributory progress sharing
            retirement plans. The aggregate costs of these plans amounted to
            $484,000 for 1994, $485,000 for 1993 and $500,000 for 1992.
 
            7. INCOME TAXES
 
            During the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
            "Accounting for Income Taxes." The Statement requires the use of the
            asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting
            for income taxes (liability method). Under this method, deferred tax
            assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
            financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
            Financial statements for prior years have not been restated.
            Comparative income tax information is reflected under the liability
            method for 1994 and the deferred method for 1993 and 1992.
 
            The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 as of July 1, 1993
            was to decrease the net loss by $264,000 ($.03 per share), primarily
            due to a reduction in the expected tax rates used to measure the
            deferred tax assets and liabilities.

            liabilities at June 30, 1994 are as follows:

            For Canadian income tax purposes, approximately $2,429,000 of
            non-capital losses and scientific research and experimental
            development expenditures are available at June 30, 1994 for
            carryover against income in future tax years. These carryovers begin
            to expire in the year 2000. In addition, unused investment tax
            credits of approximately $333,000 at June 30, 1994 are available for
            carryover against tax liabilities in future tax years. These
            carryover credits will begin to expire in the year 2004. For
            financial reporting purposes, a valuation reserve for the full
            amount of the Canadian carryovers has been established. This
            valuation reserve amounted to $622,000 at July 1, 1993 and
            $1,304,000 at June 30, 1994.

            8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
            There are various legal proceedings pending against the Company. In
            many cases, these proceedings involve ordinary and routine claims
            incidental to the business of the Company. In others, they represent
            allegations that are non-routine. The Company and its subsidiaries
            are also involved in certain compliance issues with the United
            States Environmental Protection Agency and various state
            environmental regulatory agencies. The Company has been involved in
            an environmental clean-up effort at one of its facilities since
            1983. A reserve of $1,200,000 was established and charged against
            operations in 1991 in order to cover estimated minimum future costs
            of this clean-up effort. As of June 30, 1994, the remaining reserve
            for these future costs at this facility, principally ongoing
            monitoring, totaled $663,000. The Company has previously recovered
            all amounts available under insurance policies concerning this
            clean-up effort.
 
            The ultimate legal and financial liability of the Company in respect
            to these matters cannot be estimated with certainty. Based upon its
            own examination and experience to date, and upon information
            provided by legal counsel and outside consultants, it is
            management's opinion that the resolution of these matters should not
            have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial

            The following unaudited information shows selected items by quarter
            for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. As
            explained in Note 1, Changes in Methods of Accounting, the first
            quarter 1994 loss and loss per common share have been restated to
            reflect the retroactive application of SFAS No. 112. This
            restatement increased the first quarter 1994 net loss by $264,000
            ($.03 per share) from amounts previously reported.

            In the fourth quarter of 1994, gross profit was decreased by
            approximately $4,600,000 due to downward adjustments in the carrying
            value of inventories and related costs of certain commercial and
            defense contracts within the Electronics segment.
 
            10. SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
            The Company's operations have been classified into two segments: (1)
            ELECTRONICS includes micro-processor based systems, transducers,
            printed circuit boards and assemblies, sensors and electronic and
            electromechanical contract manufacturing for the telecommunications,

            were $34,675,000 in 1994, $32,607,000 in 1993 and $37,789,000 in
            1992, respectively, with a majority of these sales from the
            Electronics segment. Sales of ASW devices and related engineering
            contract services for the years 1994-1990 contributed approximately
            24%, 45%, 61%, 61% and 50%, respectively, to total sales. Sales of

            18% and 13%, respectively, to total sales while sales of horns for
            1994 contributed approximately 10% to total sales. Sales between
            segments were not significant in any of these years.
 
            Operating profit is total revenue less operating expenses. In
            computing operating profit, general corporate expenses and interest
            expense have not been allocated to business segments. General
            corporate expenses include general and administrative costs. General
            corporate assets consist primarily of cash and invested funds,
            deferred taxes, prepaid pension costs and income taxes recoverable.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
            The Company's operations have been classified into two segments:
            Electronics and Automotive and Industrial Products.
 
            FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993
 
            Sales for the year ended June 30, 1994 totaled $201,174,000, a
            decline of $31,878,000 (14%) from 1993. Revenues were below internal
            expectations. Sales decreased 36% at Sparton Electronics, reflecting
            both the anticipated declining level of U.S. Government
            defense-related sales and unexpected delays in certain defense
            product shipments. In addition, certain commercial sales did not
            materialize as planned. Commercial sales volume at Sparton
            Electronics continues to expand, but not at a level sufficient to
            offset the decline in defense-related revenues. Sales decreased
            substantially at the Canadian unit compared both to last year and to
            internal expectations. Revenues also declined at Sparton Technology,
            as anticipated, due to reduced government and contract manufacturing
            sales. This revenue decrease was partially offset by expanding
            foreign and proprietary product revenues. The Automotive and
            Industrial Products segment sales continue to expand with an
            aggregate revenue increase of $20,126,000 (24%) for the current
            year. Sales increases occurred at all three units that comprise this
            segment. This growth exceeded expectations by over $6,000,000 and
            reflects both increased demand as well as new product shipments.
 
            The Company reported a loss from operations of $6,806,000 in 1994
            compared to income from operations of $11,016,000 in 1993. These
            operating results were below expectations. Sparton Electronics
            incurred a loss for the current year compared to profitable
            operations the previous year. Margins continue to be adversely
            impacted by increased costs associated with the start-up of several
            new programs, unexpected production delays and lower than
            anticipated sales volumes. In the fourth quarter of 1994, gross
            margins were decreased by approximately $4,600,000 due to the
            writedown in carrying value of inventories and related costs of
            certain commercial and defense contracts within Sparton Electronics.
            This adjustment resulted from a review of existing products and
            markets and the inventories' realizable value. The Canadian unit
            incurred an operating loss primarily due to extremely low sales
            volume. Sparton Technology reported a small loss in 1994, but this
            loss was significantly less than that incurred in 1993 primarily due
            to various cost cutting measures instituted. The Automotive and
            Industrial Products segment incurred a small operating loss for the
            current year compared to an operating profit last year. An operating
            profit for 1994 was anticipated. Factors contributing to this loss
            included costs associated with the relocation of a production
            facility, unexpected difficulties on new product launches, capacity
            problems at certain facilities, and an inability to adjust certain
            prices due to competitive pressures. A production facility was
            purchased in Hartford City, Indiana during the year in order to
            expand this segment's manufacturing capacity. Price increases on
            several product lines have been requested, but with only limited
            success. Efforts to obtain price increases continue.
 
            Interest expense increased $83,000 in 1994 to $685,000 due to higher
            average borrowings. Other income increased $242,000 to $471,000
            primarily due to the realization of gain on the sale of a plant.
            Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
            Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The
            cumulative effect of this required change in the method for
            accounting for income taxes resulted in a credit in the first
            quarter of 1994 of $264,000 ($.03 per share), primarily from a
            reduction in the income tax rates used to record deferred tax
            liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company elected to
            early adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
            "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," retroactively
            as of July 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of this change as of the
            beginning of the year was a charge of $264,000 ($.03 per share), net
            of income taxes of $149,000. This accounting change had no material
            effect on the results of operations for the year or for the
            individual quarterly reporting periods. The accounting changes, when
            taken together, had no effect on the net loss reported for 1994.
 
            After provision (credit) for applicable income taxes, as discussed
            in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company incurred a net
            loss of $4,899,000 ($.63 per share) in 1994 compared to net income
            of $6,638,000 ($.85 per share) in 1993.
 
            FISCAL 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1992
 
            Sales for the year ended June 30, 1993 totaled $233,052,000, a
            decline of $12,328,000 (5%) from 1992. Sales decreased $24,515,000
            (16%) at Sparton Electronics. This decrease reflected the declining
            level of U.S. Government defense-related sales. Sparton Electronics
            commercial sales expanded, but not at a sufficient level to offset
            the decline in U.S. Government revenues. Sales for 1993 at the
            Canadian unit declined compared to the level achieved in 1992.
            Revenues at Sparton Technology decreased 33% due to reduced
            government and contract manufacturing sales. In the third quarter of
            1993, Sparton Technology was notified that it was not awarded a
            major add-on contract for U.S. Postal Service equipment which 
            had been anticipated. The customer, a prime contractor to the U.S.
            Postal Service, was not selected for an award. The Automotive and
            Industrial Products segment continued to expand with an aggregate
            sales increase of $21,160,000 (33%)
 

20
<PAGE>   23
 
            in 1993 compared to the prior year. This increase reflects both
            increased customer demand as well as new product shipments.
 
            The Company reported income from operations of $11,016,000 in 1993
            compared to $12,465,000 in 1992. Sparton Electronics operated
            profitably, but below the level achieved in 1992. Margins continued
            to be adversely impacted by increased costs associated with delays
            in the production schedule and increased costs of materials. The
            Canadian unit operated at a loss in 1993. Sparton Technology
            reported a loss in 1993 compared to profitable operations the prior
            year as sales volume was significantly lower than anticipated. The
            previously mentioned loss of an anticipated U.S. Postal Service
            related contract has resulted in staff reductions at this unit. The
            Automotive and Industrial Products segment had profitable operations
            of $2,233,000 in 1993 compared to a loss of $1,800,000 in 1992.
            While improvements were realized at all three units, aggregate
            automotive margins remained below desired levels due to the
            inability to adjust prices primarily because of competitive
            pressures.
 
            Interest expense decreased $471,000 in 1993 to $602,000 due to lower
            average borrowings and lower interest rates. Average borrowings
            decreased approximately $4,000,000 to $11,700,000 in 1993. Other
            income declined $188,000 to $229,000. After provision for applicable
            income taxes, the Company reported net income of $6,638,000 ($.85
            per share) in 1993 compared to $7,968,000 ($1.02 per share) in 1992.
 
            LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
            The primary source of cash and equivalents has historically been
            from operations. Short-term credit facilities are used to provide
            liquidity. The Company anticipates a change in the mix of its
            capital resources as the volume of U.S. defense-related contract
            work declines. Certain contracts, including many within the defense
            operations of Sparton Electronics, provide for interim progress
            billings based on costs incurred. These progress billings reduce the
            amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the
            performance of these contracts. As the volume of U.S.
            defense-related contract work declines, so will the relative
            importance of progress billings as a component of the Company's
            aggregate capital resources. Unused amounts available under existing
            credit facilities are the only immediate source of cash and
            equivalents.
 
            Cash flows used by operating activities were $10,610,000 in 1994
            compared to cash flows provided of $7,760,000 in 1993 and
            $11,077,000 in 1992. Primary causes of the 1994 cash flows used in
            operating activities were operating losses, decreases in accounts
            payable and increases in income taxes recoverable.
 
            Cash flows used by investing activities were $6,817,000 in 1994,
            $3,431,000 in 1993 and $2,701,000 in 1992. The Company's principal
            investing activity was the purchase of property, plant and
            equipment. As previously discussed, the Company purchased a
            production facility in Hartford City, Indiana in order to expand its
            automotive operations. The Company will continue to invest in
            additional plant and equipment to accommodate additional automotive
            business previously awarded.
 
            Cash flows from financing activities were $16,580,000 in 1994
            compared to cash flows used of $5,185,000 in 1993 and $8,180,000 in
            1992. The increase in 1994 was due to the increase in the Company's
            short-term borrowings to fund its operating and investing
            activities. The Company maintains unsecured, informal lines of
            credit currently totalling $26,500,000 with three separate banks.
 
            At June 30, 1994, the Company had $42,205,000 in working capital. At
            that date, there were no significant unusual contractual
            commitments.
 
            OTHER
 
            The Company has been involved in an environmental clean-up effort at
            Sparton Technology's Coors Road facility since 1983. Costs incurred
            totalled $81,000 for 1994 compared to $196,000 last year. These
            costs were charged against a reserve initiated in 1991 to cover
            estimated future minimum costs. As of June 30, 1994, the remaining
            reserve for future minimum costs totalled $663,000. The Company has
            previously recovered all amounts available under insurance policies
            concerning this clean-up effort. A remedial action plan has been
            developed and submitted for approval but negotiations continue with
            respect to such plan. In addition, the Company is involved in
            several related issues with State of New Mexico environmental
            agencies. Until these and other related issues are resolved,
            management is unable to accurately assess what the ultimate costs
            incurred may be. Management continues to work diligently in pursuing
            these issues and believes that their ultimate resolution should not
            have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
            financial statements.
 
            The Company's sales of sonobuoys, principally to the U.S. Navy, have
            declined dramatically from $151,024,000 in 1992 to $47,645,000 in
            1994, reflecting overall changes in the U.S. Navy's budget. Based on
            current information, it is expected that the U.S. Navy's budget for
            production sonobuoys for the foreseeable future will continue at
            reduced levels. The Navy
 
                                                                            21

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
                  CONTINUED
 
            is funding development efforts to improve the detection capability
            of current systems and to implement new detection systems for
            planned deliveries starting in 1996. The Company is currently
            developing certain of these new systems both individually and
            jointly with a major competitor. At the present time, the Company is
            uncertain as to the market potential of these new systems, and if it
            would be the supplier of choice if these systems go to production.
            The international market for sonobuoys has also been adversely
            impacted by reduced budgets. As most foreign governments use
            sonobuoys for training and do not maintain the same high level of
            reserves of the U.S. Navy, the reductions in the international
            market presently experienced and expected in the future should be
            less severe. In response to this changing environment, the Company
            has previously consolidated certain of its manufacturing facilities,
            continues to reduce costs within the defense-oriented operations and
            is developing commercial opportunities which will utilize its
            existing technological and manufacturing capabilities. In addition,
            the Company is focusing on expanding sales in its automotive and
            other commercial electronics markets on a worldwide basis.
            Management, however, cannot predict the level of U.S. sonobuoy
            awards it will receive over the next several years, the growth in
            sales volume of new commercial business intended to replace these
            declining defense revenues, nor the resulting financial impact of
            these changes on the Company's operations. As with any change of
            this magnitude, unexpected delays in new program start-ups and their
            associated cost impacts frequently occur. Investors should be aware
            of this uncertainty and make their own independent evaluation.
