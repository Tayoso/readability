Exhibit 10(d)

RESOLVED, that the Management Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Plan")
of The Quaker Oats Company be amended to remove the funding
limitations contained therein, so as to provide for discretionary
funding by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company, and to make other administrative changes deemed
desirable.

FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Plan is hereby amended and restated to
read as follows:


                "MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE BONUS PLAN
                               OF
                     THE QUAKER OATS COMPANY
       As Amended and Restated Effective September 8, 1993


1.   PURPOSE AND ELIGIBILITY.  The Plan is designed to promote
the interests of The Quaker Oats Company (the "Company") and its
shareholders by providing incentive bonuses for officers and
other managerial employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.

2.   ADMINISTRATION.  The Plan shall be administered by the
Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of
Directors of the Company who shall not be eligible to participate
in the Plan.

3.   BONUS FUND.  The Committee shall determine the amount of the
Bonus Fund for each fiscal year.  The Committee shall establish
the criteria it will use in determining the amount of the Bonus
Fund, which criteria shall be communicated to Plan participants
to the extent deemed feasible by the Chief Executive Officer.

4.   AWARDS.  For each fiscal year the Committee shall determine
the amounts that shall be paid from the Bonus Fund as individual
awards for each officer who is also a Director of the Company and
the aggregate amount available from the Bonus Fund for awards to
other eligible employees.  The Chief Executive Officer shall
determine the employees and the amount each shall receive from
such aggregate amount.  All bonus payments shall be made as soon
as practicable after the close of the fiscal year except where
the Chief Executive Officer, in his discretion, directs that a
delay in payment to certain eligible employees would further the
purposes of the Plan."

Exhibit 10(f)



              EXECUTIVE SEPARATION AGREEMENT


THIS AGREEMENT is made between The Quaker Oats Company, a
New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), and W. Stephen
Perry (the "Executive"), dated this 2ND day of August,
1994.

                     WITNESSETH THAT:

WHEREAS, the Company wishes to attract and retain well-
qualified executive and key personnel and to assure both
itself and the Executive of continuity of management in
the event of any actual or threatened change in control of
the Company;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the
parties as follows:

1. Operation of Agreement.  The "effective date of this
Agreement" shall be the date on which the Executive
declares it effective, by notice to the Company in
writing, but only if a change in control of the Company
(as defined in Section 2) has occurred on or before the
date of the notice.

2. Change in Control.  A "change in control of the
Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if:

a. any "Person," which shall mean a "person" as such term
is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")
(other than the Company, any trustee or other fiduciary
holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
Company, or any company owned, directly or indirectly, by
the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company),
is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of
securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
voting securities; provided, however, that this paragraph
a. shall not apply to any Person who becomes such a
beneficial owner of such Company securities pursuant to an
agreement with the Company approved by the Company's Board
of Directors (the "Board"), entered into before such
Person has become such a beneficial owner of Company
securities representing 5% or more of the combined voting
power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities;

b. during any period of 24 consecutive months (not
 including any period prior to the execution of this
Agreement), individuals, who at the beginning of such
period constitute the Board, and any new director (other
than a director designated by a Person who has entered
into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction
described in paragraph a., c.(2) or d. of this Section)
whose election by the Board, or whose nomination for
election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a
vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors before
the beginning of the period cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority thereof;

c. the stockholders of the Company approve (1) a plan of
complete liquidation of the Company or (2) the sale or
disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of
the Company's assets unless the acquirer of the assets or
its directors shall meet the conditions for a merger or
consolidation in subparagraphs d.(1) or d.(2); or

d. the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or
consolidation of the Company with any other company other
than:

(1)  such a merger or consolidation which would result in
the voting securities of the Company outstanding
immediately prior thereto  continuing to represent (either
by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting
securities of the surviving entity) more than 70% of the
combined voting power of the Company's or such surviving
entity's outstanding voting securities immediately after
such merger or consolidation; or

(2)     such  a merger or consolidation which would result
      in
the directors of the Company who were directors
immediately prior thereto continuing to constitute at
least 50% of the directors of the surviving entity
immediately after such merger or consolidation.








                             2


In this paragraph d., "surviving entity" shall mean only
an entity in which all of the Company's stockholders
immediately before such merger or consolidation become
stockholders by the terms of such merger or consolidation,
and the phrase "directors of the Company who were
directors immediately prior thereto" shall include only
individuals who were directors of the Company at the
beginning of the 24 consecutive month period preceding the
date of such merger or consolidation, or who were new
directors (other than any director designated by a Person
who has entered into an agreement with the Company to
effect a transaction described in paragraph a., c.(2),
d.(1) or d.(2) of this Section) whose election by the
Board, or whose nomination for election by the Company's
stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-
thirds (2/3) of the directors before the beginning of such
period.

3. Employment Period.  The Company hereby agrees to
continue the Executive in its employ, and the Executive
hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, for
the period commencing on the effective date of this
Agreement and ending on the earlier to occur of the third
anniversary of such effective date or the 65th birthday of
the Executive (the "employment period"), to exercise such
authorities and powers, and perform such duties and
functions, as are commensurate with the authorities and
powers being exercised, and duties and functions being
performed, by the Executive immediately prior to the
effective date of this Agreement, which services shall be
performed at the current location where the Executive was
employed immediately prior to the effective date of this
Agreement or at such other location within a 30-mile
radius of such current location.  The Executive shall not
be required to accept any other location.  The Executive
agrees that during the employment period he shall devote
his full business time exclusively to his executive duties
as described herein and perform such duties faithfully and
efficiently.

4. Compensation, Compensation Plans, Benefit Plans,
Perquisites.   During   the   employment   period and
prior to termination (as defined in Section 5) of the
Executive,  the Executive shall be compensated as follows:






                             3
a. He shall receive an annual salary which is not less
than his annual salary immediately prior to the effective
date of this Agreement, with the opportunity for
increases, from time to time thereafter, which are in
accordance with the Company's regular practices.

b. He shall be eligible to participate on a reasonable
basis in bonus, stock option, restricted stock and other
incentive compensation plans, which shall provide benefits
comparable to those to which he was provided immediately
prior to the effective date of this Agreement.

c. He shall be eligible to participate on a reasonable
basis in tax-qualified employee benefit plans (including
but not limited to pension, profit sharing and employee
stock ownership plans), and supplemental nonqualified
employee benefit plans relating thereto, which shall
provide benefits comparable to those to which he was
provided immediately prior to the effective date of this
Agreement.

d. He shall be entitled to receive employee benefits
(including, but not limited to, medical and life insurance
benefits) and perquisites which are comparable to those to
which he was provided immediately prior to the effective
date of this Agreement.

5. Termination. "Termination" shall mean either (a)
termination by the Company of the employment of the
Executive with the Company for any reason other than
death, physical or mental incapacity, or cause (as defined
below), or  (b) resignation of the Executive upon the
occurrence of any of the following events:

(1) a significant change in the nature or scope of the
Executive's authorities, powers, functions, or duties from
those described in Section 3;

(2) a reduction in total compensation from that provided
in Section 4;

(3) the breach by the Company of any other provision of
this Agreement; or

(4) a reasonable determination by the Executive that, as a
result of a change in control of the Company his position
is significantly affected so that he is unable to exercise
the authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to
his position as described in Section 3.


                             4
"Cause" means gross misconduct or willful and material
breach of this Agreement by the Executive.  No act, or
failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed
"willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive  not in good faith and without reasonable belief
that the action or omission was in the best interest of
the Company.

6. Confidentiality.  The Executive agrees that during and
after the employment period, he will not divulge or
appropriate to his own use or the use of others any secret
or confidential information or knowledge pertaining to the
business of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries,
obtained during his employment by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries.

7. Severance and Benefit Payments.

a. In the event of termination of the Executive during the
employment period, the Company shall pay the Executive a
lump-sum severance allowance equal to salary and bonus
payments for the following 24 calendar months at the rate
which he would have been entitled to receive in accordance
with Section 4.  Such a severance allowance shall be
adjusted to include expected increases to the Executive's
salary and bonus for such period, but shall not be
adjusted on a present value basis.

b. In the event of termination of the Executive during the
employment period, the Company shall also pay the
Executive a lump-sum benefit payment in an amount
equivalent to  (1) the benefits he would have accrued or
been allocated under any tax-qualified employee  benefit
plan (including but not limited to pension, profit sharing
and employee stock ownership plans) and any nonqualified
supplemental benefit plan relating thereto, maintained by
the Company if he had remained in the employ of the
Company for 24 calendar months after his termination,
which benefits will be paid in addition to the benefits
provided under such  plans, and  (2) any other employee
benefits (including, but not limited to, coverage under
any medical and life insurance arrangements or programs)
to which he would have been entitled under all such
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
maintained by the Company if he had remained in the employ
of the Company for 24 calendar months after his
termination.  Such a benefit payment shall be adjusted to
include expected increases to the Executive's salary,
bonus and other compensation having an effect on such
benefits for such period, but shall not be adjusted on a
present value basis.

                             5


c. The amount of the severance allowance and benefit
payment described in this Section shall be determined and
such payment shall be made as soon as it is reasonably
possible.

d. The severance allowance and benefit payment to be
provided pursuant to this Section 7 shall be in addition
to, and shall not be reduced by, any other amounts or
benefits provided by separate agreement with the
Executive, or plan or arrangement of the Company or its
subsidiaries, unless specifically stipulated in an
agreement which constitutes an amendment to this Agreement
as provided in Section 14.

8. Tax Reimbursement.  If any payment to the Executive
under this Agreement or under any other compensation
agreement, plan or arrangement of the Company or its
subsidiaries is subject to an excise tax under section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(the "Code"), the Company shall pay the Executive an
additional amount which is equal to the amount of such
excise tax.  The Company will provide complete
compensation and tax data on a timely basis to the
Executive and to an accounting firm or law firm designated
by the Executive in order to enable the Executive to
determine the extent to which any payments under this
Agreement or under any other compensation agreement, plan
or arrangement of the Company or its subsidiaries
constitute "parachute payments" or "excess parachute
payments" under section 280G of the Code.  Any additional
amount payable under this Section 8 shall be due and paid
no later than ten business days after the other payment to
which such additional payment relates; provided, however,
that if such additional amount cannot be determined on or
before such due date, the Company shall pay an amount on
the due date which it in good faith estimates to be
payable and shall pay the remainder of such additional
amount (together with interest at a rate equal to 120% of
the applicable Federal rate determined under Section
1274(d) of the Code) as soon as such amount can be
determined, but no later than 30 days after the date on
which Executive becomes subject to the payment of the
excise tax.





                             6

9. Mitigation and Set Off.  The Executive shall not be
required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided
for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or
otherwise.  The Company shall not be entitled to set off
against the amounts payable to the Executive under this
Agreement any amounts owed to the Company by the
Executive, any amounts earned by the Executive in other
employment after termination of his employment with the
Company, or any amounts which might have been earned by
the Executive in other employment had he sought such other
employment.

10. Arbitration of All Disputes.  Any controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach
thereof, except with respect to Section 8, shall be
settled by arbitration in the City of Chicago in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois by three
arbitrators appointed by the parties.  If the parties
cannot agree on the appointment, one arbitrator shall be
appointed by the Company and one by the Executive, and the
third shall be appointed by the first two arbitrators.  If
the first two arbitrators cannot agree on the appointment
of a third arbitrator, then the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association, except with respect to the
selection of arbitrators which shall be as provided in
this Section 10.  Judgement upon the award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.  In the event that it shall be
necessary or desirable for the Executive to retain legal
counsel or incur other costs and expenses in connection
with enforcement of his rights under this Agreement,
Executive shall be entitled to recover from the Company
his reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and expenses in
connection with enforcement of his rights (including the
enforcement of any arbitration award in court).  Payment
shall be made to the Executive by the Company at the time
these attorneys' fees and costs and expenses are incurred
by the Executive.  If, however, the arbitrators should
later determine that under the circumstances the Executive
could have had no reasonable expectation of prevailing on
the merits at the time he initiated the arbitration based
on the information then available to him, he shall repay
any such payments to the Company in accordance with the
order of the arbitrators.  Any award of the arbitrators
shall include interest at a rate or rates considered just
under the circumstances by the arbitrators.


                             7

11. Notices.  Any notices, requests, demands, and other
communications provided for by this Agreement shall be
sufficient if in writing and if sent by registered or
certified mail to the Executive at the last address he has
filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the
Company, at its principal executive offices.

12. Non-Alienation.  The Executive shall not have any
right to pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or in any way
create a lien upon any amounts provided under this
Agreement; and no benefits payable hereunder shall be
assignable in anticipation of payment either by voluntary
or involuntary acts, or by operation of law.  Nothing in
this paragraph shall limit the Executive's rights or
powers which his executor or administrator would otherwise
have.

13. Governing Law.  The Agreement shall be construed and
enforced according to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), and the laws of the State
of Illinois, other than its laws respecting choice of law,
to the extent not pre-empted by ERISA.

14. Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended or cancelled
by mutual agreement of the parties in writing without the
consent of any other person and, so long as the Executive
lives, no person, other than the parties hereto, shall
have any rights under or interest in this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof.

15. Term.  Unless the Executive has theretofore declared
this Agreement effective, pursuant to Section 1 of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate two years after
the day and year first above written, provided that this
Agreement may thereupon be renewed annually at the
discretion of the Board.

16. Successors to the Company.  Except as otherwise
provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of
the Company.

17. Severability.  In the event that any provision or
portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby
and shall remain in full force and effect.






                             8
18. Prior Agreement.  Any prior Executive Separation
agreement between the Executive and the Company which has
not yet terminated pursuant to its terms, is cancelled by
mutual consent of the Executive and the Company pursuant
to execution of this Agreement, effective as of the day
and year first above written.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set his
hand and, pursuant to the authorization from its Board of
Directors, the Company has caused these presents to be
executed in its name on its behalf, and its corporate seal
to be hereunto affixed and attested by its Assistant
Secretary, all as of the day and year first above written.

the Executive (the "employment period"), to exercise such
authorities and powers, and perform such duties and

powers being exercised, and duties and functions being
performed, by the Executive immediately prior to the
effective date of this Agreement, which services shall be
performed at the current location where the Executive was
employed immediately prior to the effective date of this
Agreement or at such other location within a 30-mile

his full business time exclusively to his executive duties
as described herein and perform such duties faithfully and
efficiently.

4. Compensation, Compensation Plans, Benefit Plans,
Perquisites.   During   the   employment   period and

Executive,  the Executive shall be compensated as follows:






                             3
a. He shall receive an annual salary which is not less
than his annual salary immediately prior to the effective
date of this Agreement, with the opportunity for
increases, from time to time thereafter, which are in
accordance with the Company's regular practices.

b. He shall be eligible to participate on a reasonable
basis in bonus, stock option, restricted stock and other
incentive compensation plans, which shall provide benefits
comparable to those to which he was provided immediately
prior to the effective date of this Agreement.

c. He shall be eligible to participate on a reasonable
basis in tax-qualified employee benefit plans (including
but not limited to pension, profit sharing and employee
stock ownership plans), and supplemental nonqualified
employee benefit plans relating thereto, which shall
provide benefits comparable to those to which he was
provided immediately prior to the effective date of this
Agreement.

d. He shall be entitled to receive employee benefits
(including, but not limited to, medical and life insurance
benefits) and perquisites which are comparable to those to
which he was provided immediately prior to the effective
date of this Agreement.

5. Termination. "Termination" shall mean either (a)
termination by the Company of the employment of the
Executive with the Company for any reason other than
death, physical or mental incapacity, or cause (as defined
below), or  (b) resignation of the Executive upon the
occurrence of any of the following events:

(1) a significant change in the nature or scope of the
Executive's authorities, powers, functions, or duties from
those described in Section 3;

(2) a reduction in total compensation from that provided
in Section 4;

(3) the breach by the Company of any other provision of
this Agreement; or

(4) a reasonable determination by the Executive that, as a

his position as described in Section 3.


                             4
"Cause" means gross misconduct or willful and material
breach of this Agreement by the Executive.  No act, or
failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed
"willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive  not in good faith and without reasonable belief
that the action or omission was in the best interest of
the Company.

6. Confidentiality.  The Executive agrees that during and
after the employment period, he will not divulge or
appropriate to his own use or the use of others any secret
or confidential information or knowledge pertaining to the
business of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries,
obtained during his employment by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries.

7. Severance and Benefit Payments.

a. In the event of termination of the Executive during the
employment period, the Company shall pay the Executive a
lump-sum severance allowance equal to salary and bonus
payments for the following 24 calendar months at the rate
which he would have been entitled to receive in accordance
with Section 4.  Such a severance allowance shall be
adjusted to include expected increases to the Executive's
salary and bonus for such period, but shall not be
adjusted on a present value basis.

b. In the event of termination of the Executive during the
employment period, the Company shall also pay the
Executive a lump-sum benefit payment in an amount
equivalent to  (1) the benefits he would have accrued or
been allocated under any tax-qualified employee  benefit
plan (including but not limited to pension, profit sharing
and employee stock ownership plans) and any nonqualified
supplemental benefit plan relating thereto, maintained by
the Company if he had remained in the employ of the
Company for 24 calendar months after his termination,
which benefits will be paid in addition to the benefits
provided under such  plans, and  (2) any other employee
benefits (including, but not limited to, coverage under
any medical and life insurance arrangements or programs)
to which he would have been entitled under all such
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
maintained by the Company if he had remained in the employ
of the Company for 24 calendar months after his
termination.  Such a benefit payment shall be adjusted to
include expected increases to the Executive's salary,
bonus and other compensation having an effect on such
benefits for such period, but shall not be adjusted on a
present value basis.

                             5


c. The amount of the severance allowance and benefit
payment described in this Section shall be determined and
such payment shall be made as soon as it is reasonably
possible.

d. The severance allowance and benefit payment to be
provided pursuant to this Section 7 shall be in addition
to, and shall not be reduced by, any other amounts or
benefits provided by separate agreement with the
Executive, or plan or arrangement of the Company or its
subsidiaries, unless specifically stipulated in an
agreement which constitutes an amendment to this Agreement
as provided in Section 14.

8. Tax Reimbursement.  If any payment to the Executive
under this Agreement or under any other compensation
agreement, plan or arrangement of the Company or its
subsidiaries is subject to an excise tax under section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(the "Code"), the Company shall pay the Executive an
additional amount which is equal to the amount of such
excise tax.  The Company will provide complete
compensation and tax data on a timely basis to the
Executive and to an accounting firm or law firm designated
by the Executive in order to enable the Executive to
determine the extent to which any payments under this
Agreement or under any other compensation agreement, plan
or arrangement of the Company or its subsidiaries
constitute "parachute payments" or "excess parachute
payments" under section 280G of the Code.  Any additional
amount payable under this Section 8 shall be due and paid
no later than ten business days after the other payment to
which such additional payment relates; provided, however,
that if such additional amount cannot be determined on or
before such due date, the Company shall pay an amount on
the due date which it in good faith estimates to be
payable and shall pay the remainder of such additional
amount (together with interest at a rate equal to 120% of
the applicable Federal rate determined under Section
1274(d) of the Code) as soon as such amount can be
determined, but no later than 30 days after the date on
which Executive becomes subject to the payment of the
excise tax.





                             6

9. Mitigation and Set Off.  The Executive shall not be
required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided
for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or
otherwise.  The Company shall not be entitled to set off
against the amounts payable to the Executive under this
Agreement any amounts owed to the Company by the
Executive, any amounts earned by the Executive in other
employment after termination of his employment with the
Company, or any amounts which might have been earned by
the Executive in other employment had he sought such other
employment.

10. Arbitration of All Disputes.  Any controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach
thereof, except with respect to Section 8, shall be
settled by arbitration in the City of Chicago in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois by three
arbitrators appointed by the parties.  If the parties
cannot agree on the appointment, one arbitrator shall be
appointed by the Company and one by the Executive, and the
third shall be appointed by the first two arbitrators.  If
the first two arbitrators cannot agree on the appointment
of a third arbitrator, then the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association, except with respect to the
selection of arbitrators which shall be as provided in
this Section 10.  Judgement upon the award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.  In the event that it shall be
necessary or desirable for the Executive to retain legal
counsel or incur other costs and expenses in connection
with enforcement of his rights under this Agreement,
Executive shall be entitled to recover from the Company
his reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and expenses in
connection with enforcement of his rights (including the
enforcement of any arbitration award in court).  Payment
shall be made to the Executive by the Company at the time
these attorneys' fees and costs and expenses are incurred
by the Executive.  If, however, the arbitrators should
later determine that under the circumstances the Executive
could have had no reasonable expectation of prevailing on
the merits at the time he initiated the arbitration based
on the information then available to him, he shall repay
any such payments to the Company in accordance with the
order of the arbitrators.  Any award of the arbitrators
shall include interest at a rate or rates considered just
under the circumstances by the arbitrators.


                             7

11. Notices.  Any notices, requests, demands, and other
communications provided for by this Agreement shall be
sufficient if in writing and if sent by registered or
certified mail to the Executive at the last address he has
filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the
Company, at its principal executive offices.

12. Non-Alienation.  The Executive shall not have any
right to pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or in any way
create a lien upon any amounts provided under this
Agreement; and no benefits payable hereunder shall be
assignable in anticipation of payment either by voluntary
or involuntary acts, or by operation of law.  Nothing in
this paragraph shall limit the Executive's rights or
powers which his executor or administrator would otherwise
have.

13. Governing Law.  The Agreement shall be construed and
enforced according to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), and the laws of the State
of Illinois, other than its laws respecting choice of law,
to the extent not pre-empted by ERISA.

14. Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended or cancelled
by mutual agreement of the parties in writing without the
consent of any other person and, so long as the Executive
lives, no person, other than the parties hereto, shall
have any rights under or interest in this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof.

15. Term.  Unless the Executive has theretofore declared
this Agreement effective, pursuant to Section 1 of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate two years after
the day and year first above written, provided that this
Agreement may thereupon be renewed annually at the
discretion of the Board.

16. Successors to the Company.  Except as otherwise
provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and

the Company.

17. Severability.  In the event that any provision or
portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby
and shall remain in full force and effect.






                             8

2. Change in Control.  A "change in control of the
Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if:

a. any "Person," which shall mean a "person" as such term
is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")
(other than the Company, any trustee or other fiduciary

Person has become such a beneficial owner of Company
securities representing 5% or more of the combined voting
power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities;

b. during any period of 24 consecutive months (not
 including any period prior to the execution of this

constitute at least a majority thereof;

c. the stockholders of the Company approve (1) a plan of

securities of the surviving entity) more than 70% of the
combined voting power of the Company's or such surviving
entity's outstanding voting securities immediately after
such merger or consolidation; or

(2)     such  a merger or consolidation which would result
      in
the directors of the Company who were directors
immediately prior thereto continuing to constitute at

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING PROFITS
An In-depth Analysis

When a U.S. company conducts business outside of the country, financial
statements of its foreign operations must be translated into U.S. dollars
for consolidation purposes.  But translating sales and operating income
alone do not completely reflect the costs of doing business abroad.
Financing costs-foreign exchange and net interest costs-also need to be
taken into account.  At Quaker, we view the financial results of our
international businesses on a financing-adjusted basis.  We call this
"adjusted operating income."  It provides an economic view of the operating
results of each foreign entity and provides for greater comparability
between years, particularly when hyper-inflation (like in Brazil) or
foreign currency translations distort operating income.

In fiscal 1994, several factors influenced International Grocery Products
operating income.  In Europe, pet food volume and operating income
decreased from fiscal 1993 levels, reflecting the weakened economies in
many of the countries there.  In Latin America, Brazil's operating income
increased 16 percent over the prior year reflecting that country's hyper-
inflationary environment.  However, when financing costs are considered,
Brazil's adjusted operating income was actually below that achieved a year
ago.  These higher financing costs can be found in the Company's
consolidated income statement.  (See page 44.)  Interest expense rose
considerably reflecting the higher costs of financing our Brazilian operation.

In addition, over the last three years, we have aggressively expanded
Gatorade thirst quencher internationally.  It is now available in 25
countries outside of the United States.  Expenses to introduce this thirst
quencher into new markets have had a negative impact on International
operating income, as well as adjusted operating income.  While the Company
expects to continue the expansion of Gatorade, it also expects that the
underwriting costs in Europe will begin to subside.

Below the above narrative are graphs depicting operating income and adjusted
operating income for Europe and Latin America and Pacific for fiscal 1989
through fiscal 1994 excluding restructuring charges and gains on divestitures
as follows (in millions of dollars):

Management's Discussion and Analysis


Fiscal 1994 Compared with Fiscal 1993

Operating Results

Consolidated net sales for fiscal 1994 were $5.95 billion, up 4 percent from
fiscal 1993.  The increase in net sales reflects a 4 percent worldwide
increase in volumes and an improved product mix.  Significantly offsetting
higher sales was the negative impact of translating European sales into U.S.
dollars.  Sales for fiscal 1994 would have been $140.1 million higher if
European exchange rates had remained stable with the prior year.  Price
increases did not have a significant impact on sales.

U.S. and Canadian Grocery Products sales increased 8 percent to $4.25 billion
on a volume increase of 6 percent.  Volume growth for Gatorade thirst
quencher, ready-to-eat cereals, grain-based snacks and Golden Grain products,
more than offset decreases in food service volumes.  Gatorade thirst quencher
performance is particularly notable, in that two major soft drink competitors
have broadened the distribution of their sports beverages throughout the
United States, currently Gatorade thirst quencher's largest market.  The Company
expects this heightened level of competition to continue in the coming year.

International Grocery Products sales decreased 5 percent to $1.70 billion,
although overall volumes increased 1 percent.  Weaker European currencies
and lower volumes of European pet foods, cereals and oils contributed to the
decline.  The weak European economy and the retail trade's tight management
of inventories suggest that the operating environment in Europe will continue
to be difficult in the near term.  Offsetting Europe's decline, Gatorade thirst
quencher volumes increased significantly in Latin America.

Gross profit margins increased to 50.9 percent from 49.9 percent in the prior
year primarily due to an improved product mix and cost-containment initiatives
in the United States, which more than offset commodity and distribution cost
increases.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rose 5
percent to $2.43 billion due mainly to an 8 percent increase in advertising
and merchandising (A&M) expenses.  A&M expenses were 26.6 percent of net
sales in fiscal 1994, up from 25.7 percent in fiscal 1993, and are likely to
continue at or near this level in the future.

Operating income was $537.2 million compared to $575.2 million last year.
Excluding restructuring charges and gains on divestitures (see following
sections) from both years, operating income was $645.8 compared to $595.7
million.  On that same basis, U.S. and Canadian Grocery Products operating
income was $543.8 million versus $485.6 million in fiscal 1993.  The 12
percent increase reflects significant increases from the Gatorade thirst
quencher, ready-to-eat cereals and Aunt Jemima products businesses,
partially offset by decreases in food service.

International Grocery Products operating income decreased to $102.0 million
versus $110.1 million in fiscal 1993, excluding restructuring charges and
gains on divestitures.  European operating income declined $14.9 million due
mainly to volume declines in the pet foods and cereals businesses.  Latin
American and Pacific operating income increased $6.8 million primarily due to
volume increases in Mexico and the hyper-inflationary effects of translating
Brazil's results into U.S. dollars.  The operating income improvement in
Brazil was more than offset by higher interest and foreign exchange costs
in that country.

Restructuring Charges

The Company is pursuing a series of cost-reduction and realignment
activities to bring greater value to consumers, trade customers and
ultimately, shareholders.  As a result, the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $118.4 million, or $1.09 per share, to eliminate
positions at its headquarters and research and development facilities,
to realign its U.S. sales force, to consolidate manufacturing for its Van
Camp's, rice cakes and Aunt Jemima product lines and to close a
Canadian pet foods facility, as well as to pursue other cost-reduction
initiatives.  These changes eliminated approximately 1,500 positions,
resulting in severance and termination benefits totaling $44.7 million.
Charges associated with plant consolidations and sales office closures
totaled $38.3 million, of which 80 percent represents asset write-offs.
Product-line discontinuations resulted in charges of $35.4 million, of
which 90 percent represents asset write-offs.  Cash outlays related to
severance, termination benefits and other expenses will occur
predominately in fiscal 1995 and will be funded through operating cash
flows.  These actions are expected to save between $35 million and $45
million annually beginning in fiscal 1995.  Approximately 75 percent of
these annual savings will be in cash.

Fiscal 1993 operating income included a charge of $38.6 million for the
consolidation of production facilities at a U.S. pet foods plant and a charge
of $9.7 million for European cost-reduction programs.  (See following
section.)

The Company will continue to focus on worldwide efficiency initiatives that
improve its manufacturing, marketing, logistics and customer service processes
while lowering costs and more effectively utilizing human and financial
resources.  These continuous improvement initiatives may lead to charges in
future periods.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of
restructuring charges.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

Gains on Divestitures

In fiscal 1994, the Company realized a $9.8 million gain on the sale of a
Venezuelan detergent additive business.  In fiscal 1993, the Company realized
a $17.4 million gain on the sale of two Italian businesses and a $10.4 million
gain on the sale of a business in the United Kingdom.

Interest, Foreign Exchange and Income Taxes

Net interest expense of $89.7 million increased $34.6 million versus the
prior year.  An increase of $22.1 million came from higher levels of local
currency borrowing in Brazil at significantly higher interest rates.  In
addition, the Company issued $200.0 million of medium-term notes and
increased commercial paper borrowings during the year, which accounted for
most of the remaining increase in interest expense.  Foreign exchange expenses
increased $11.1 million from the prior year primarily reflecting small losses
on European currency hedges in fiscal 1994 versus gains in fiscal 1993.
Through various hedging strategies, the Company will continue to try to
mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial
results, except in areas like Brazil where hedging opportunities are limited
and costly.  See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for
further discussion of foreign currency hedging and see page 24 of this
annual report for further discussion of international operating profits
and financing costs.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 1994 was 38.9 percent compared to 38.7
percent in fiscal 1993.  Excluding the effects of certain restructuring
charges and gains on divestitures from both years, the effective tax rate
increased to 39.4 percent from 38.4 percent.  The higher U.S. statutory tax
rate, including the legislated retroactive adjustment to January 1, 1993,
caused the overall rate to increase.  The Company has evaluated its deferred
tax assets and believes that future taxable income will be sufficient to
realize these assets.  A valuation allowance has been provided for the
deferred tax assets not expected to be realized.

Fiscal 1993 Compared with Fiscal 1992

Operating Results

Consolidated net sales for fiscal 1993 were $5.73 billion, up 3 percent from
fiscal 1992.  Volumes were up 2 percent from the prior year.  About 1
percentage point of the increase in sales was due to price increases.  U.S.
and Canadian Grocery Products sales increased 2 percent to $3.93 billion,
while volumes were even with the prior year.  International Grocery Products
sales increased 4 percent to $1.80 billion and volumes were up 6 percent.

Gross profit margins increased to 49.9 percent from 49.2 percent in the prior
year primarily due to product mix improvement, cost containment and price
increases.  SG&A expenses rose 3 percent to $2.30 billion, but remained
constant as a percentage of sales.  Total A&M expenses as a percentage of
sales were 25.7 percent, slightly lower than in the prior year.

Consolidated operating income was $575.2 million in fiscal 1993 compared to
$540.2 million in fiscal 1992.  Excluding restructuring charges and gains on
divestitures from both years, operating income increased to $595.7 million
from $539.2 million.  U.S. and Canadian Grocery Products fiscal 1993 operating
income excluding restructuring charges and gains on divestitures was $485.6
million compared to $434.0 million in fiscal 1992, an increase of $51.6
million, or 12 percent.  The increase was primarily due to gross profit margin
improvements and trade promotion timing.  Operating income improved for
ready-to-eat cereals, rice cakes and food service.  During fiscal 1992, the
Company changed the timing of trade promotions for U.S. and Canadian Grocery
Products to align production and shipments more closely with consumer demand
and to derive greater efficiencies in its go-to-market processes.  The sales
and earnings postponed in the second half of fiscal 1992 were recouped in the
first half of fiscal 1993.

International Grocery Products fiscal 1993 operating income excluding
restructuring charges and gains on divestitures increased to $110.1 million
from $105.2 million in fiscal 1992.  Operating income in Latin America
increased because of gross profit margin improvements in Brazil and the
expansion of Gatorade thirst quencher throughout most of the region.
European operating income decreased primarily as a result of higher A&M
expenses to support the continued expansion of pet foods and Gatorade thirst
quencher.

Restructuring Charges

In fiscal 1993, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $38.6 million to
consolidate production facilities at a U.S. pet foods plant.  The charge
included $20.7 million for non-cash asset write-offs and $17.9 million in
cash for severance and termination benefits and other related plant
consolidation costs.  The consolidation was completed in fiscal 1994.  The
Company also recorded a $9.7 million cash charge for severance related to
European cost-reduction programs.  The Company realized approximately
$14 million in combined savings from these actions in fiscal 1994 and
anticipates $20 million in annualized savings in fiscal 1995.

In fiscal 1992, the Company discontinued certain product lines, resulting in
non-cash asset write-offs of $10.0 million.

38

Gains on Divestitures

In fiscal 1993, the Company realized a $17.4 million gain on the sale of two
Italian businesses and a $10.4 million gain on the sale of a business in the
United Kingdom.  In fiscal 1992, the Company realized an $11.0 million
gain on the sale of the Ghirardelli chocolate business.

Interest, Foreign Exchange, Income Taxes and Accounting Changes

Net interest expense of $55.1 million decreased $12.3 million from fiscal 1992
stemming primarily from lower domestic long-term debt and lower local currency
debt in Brazil.  Foreign exchange losses increased to $15.1 million from $13.1
million last year.  The change resulted primarily from higher foreign currency
losses in Brazil, where inflation and devaluation were very significant.  These
losses were partially offset by foreign exchange hedge gains arising from the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to European currencies.  Changes
in net financing costs for Brazil were more than offset by higher operating
income in that country.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 1993 was 38.7 percent compared to 41.3 percent
in fiscal 1992.  Excluding the fiscal 1993 effects of the pet foods
restructuring charge and the gain on the sale of a United Kingdom business,
the effective tax rate decreased to 38.4 percent.  The improvement was
primarily due to lower nondeductible intangibles and a change in the mix of
domestic and foreign taxable income.

Included in net income in fiscal 1993 was the cumulative effect of adopting
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement #106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and FASB
Statement #109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The combined cumulative
effect of adoption was an after-tax charge of $115.5 million.  See Notes 13
and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The ability to generate funds internally remains one of the Company's
significant financial strengths.  Net cash provided by operating activities
of $450.8 million, $558.2 million and $581.3 million during fiscal 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively, was well in excess of the Company's dividends and
capital expenditures.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating
activities resulted mainly from changes in working capital items, primarily
accounts receivable and inventories.  Capital expenditures for fiscal
1994, 1993 and 1992 were $175.1 million, $172.3 million and $176.4 million,
respectively, with no material individual commitments outstanding.

During fiscal 1994, three million shares of the Company's outstanding common
stock were repurchased for $209.6 million under a five million share
repurchase program announced in August 1993.

Short-term and long-term debt (total debt) increased $206.7 million from
June 30, 1993 to June 30, 1994 and increased $1.9 million from June 30, 1992
to June 30, 1993.  The total debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 68.8
percent, 59.0 percent and 48.7 percent as of June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  One of the Company's financial objectives is to generate
economic value through the use of leverage, while maintaining a solid
financial position through strong operating cash flows.  The increase
in debt resulted primarily from the issuance of $200.0 million of medium-
term notes.  The medium-term notes were issued under a $600.0 million shelf
registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in fiscal 1990.
No other securities have been issued under the shelf registration.

Commercial paper has been the Company's primary source of short-term
financing.  The Company's ratings of "A1" (Standard & Poor's) and "P1"
(Moody's) have been maintained throughout the year.  In fiscal 1994, the
Company obtained new revolving credit facilities totaling $350.0 million.  The
available levels of borrowings are adequate to meet the Company's working
capital needs.  For further discussion of the Company's revolving credit
facilities and lines of credit, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Pending Accounting Changes

Effective July 1, 1994, the Company adopted FASB Statement #112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  The cumulative effect of adoption
is a $4.1 million after-tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.  The
adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on operating
results or cash flows in future years.

The Company is in compliance with the accounting required in the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position (SOP)
93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs," that requires advertising expenses to
be expensed as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.  The
adoption of this SOP, required in fiscal 1995, will have no impact on the
Company's financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include The Quaker
Oats Company and all of its subsidiaries (the "Company").  All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  Businesses acquired are
included in the results of operations since their acquisition date.  Certain
prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation.

Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of the Company's
foreign subsidiaries, other than those located in highly inflationary
countries, are translated at current exchange rates, while income and
expenses are translated at average rates for the period.  For entities in
highly inflationary countries, a combination of current and historical rates
is used to determine foreign currency gains and losses resulting from
financial statement translation.  Translation gains and losses are reported as
a component of common shareholders' equity, except for those associated with
highly inflationary countries, which are reported directly in the
consolidated income statements.

Futures, Swaps, Options and Forward Contracts - The Company enters into a
variety of futures, swaps, options and forward contracts in its management
of foreign currency and commodity price exposures.  Realized and unrealized
gains and losses on foreign currency options, currency swaps and foreign
exchange forward contracts that are effective as net investment hedges are
recognized in a component of common shareholders' equity.  Realized and
unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency options that hedge exchange
rate exposure on future raw material purchases are deferred in inventory and
subsequently included in cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity options and futures
contracts that hedge commodity price exposure are deferred in inventory
and subsequently included in cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold.
Other realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments are
recognized currently in the consolidated income statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents are composed of all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.  As a
result of the Company's cash management system, checks issued but not
presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances.
Such negative balances are included in trade accounts payable and amounted
to $53.0 million, $45.9 million and $37.6 million as of June 30, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

<TABLE>
Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, using
various cost methods, and include the cost of raw materials, labor and
overhead.  The percentage of year-end inventories valued using each of the
methods was as follows:

If the LIFO method of valuing these inventories was not used, total
inventories would have been $19.6 million, $17.2 million and $13.9 million
higher than reported as of June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Property and Depreciation - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost
and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Useful lives range from 5 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and
from 3 to 17 years for machinery and equipment.

Intangibles - Intangible assets consist principally of excess purchase price
over net tangible assets of businesses acquired (goodwill).  Goodwill is
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 40 years.  The
Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred
indicating that the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may not be
appropriate.  When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the acquired business'
undiscounted future operating income compared to the carrying value of
goodwill to determine if a write-off is necessary.  Gross goodwill as of
June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $615.2 million, $528.0 million and
$522.0 million, respectively.  Accumulated goodwill amortization as of
June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $128.0 million, $113.3 million and
$103.2 million, respectively.

Software Costs - The Company defers significant software development project
costs.  Software costs of $5.3 million, $5.0 million and $13.2 million were
deferred during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, pending the
projects' completion.  Amounts deferred are amortized over a three-year
period beginning with a project's completion.  As of June 30, 1994,
$37.5 million of completed project costs were subject to amortization.
Total amortization expense was $11.4 million, $7.7 million and $2.6 million
in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and
financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income
for a year and the bases of assets and liabilities.  Effective July 1,
1992, the Company adopted FASB

53


The Quaker Oats Company and Subsidiaries


Statement #109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires an asset and
liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
See Note 17 for further discussion.  Federal income taxes have been provided
on $187.8 million of the $293.1 million of unremitted earnings from foreign
subsidiaries.  Taxes are not provided on earnings expected to be indefinitely
reinvested.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions - The Company provides
certain health and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees.  Effective
July 1, 1992, the Company adopted FASB Statement #106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," whereby
the cost of postretirement benefits is accrued during the years that
employees render service.  See Note 13 for further discussion.

Note 2
Restructuring Charges and Gains on Divestitures

In May 1994, the Board of Directors approved plans to streamline
administrative functions, reengineer and consolidate plant operations and
discontinue certain product lines in the United States and in some
foreign locations.  The approved plans resulted in a restructuring charge
of $118.4 million and included the elimination of positions at the
headquarters and research and development facilities, a combination
and realignment of the U.S. sales force, manufacturing consolidations
for Van Camp's products, rice cakes and Aunt Jemima syrup and closing
of a Canadian pet foods facility and refocusing of the Canadian
business, as well as other cost-reduction initiatives.

The cost of providing severance and termination benefits for the
elimination of approximately 1,500 positions was $44.7 million of the
restructuring charge and will be a cash expense.  Charges associated with
plant consolidations, sales office closures and equipment that has been
determined to be permanent excess capacity total $38.3 million.  Of this
amount, $30.7 million was for non-cash asset write-offs.  The remaining
$7.6 million is in cash expenses mainly for loss on facility and sales office
leases.  Product-line discontinuations resulted in charges of $35.4 million,
of which $32.1 million was for non-cash asset write-offs.  The remaining
$3.3 million will be in cash expenses for loss on leases and other
associated costs.  Restructuring reserves of $61.1 million were included
in other accrued liabilities as of June 30, 1994.

The reengineering efforts are expected to save between $35 million and
$45 million annually beginning in fiscal 1995.  Approximately 75 percent of
the savings will be in cash.  Severance, termination benefits and other cash
outlays will occur predominately in fiscal 1995 and will be funded through
operating cash flows.

In fiscal 1993, the Company took a restructuring charge of $38.6 million to
consolidate production facilities at a U.S. pet foods plant.  The charge
included $20.7 million for non-cash asset write-offs and $17.9 million in
cash for severance and termination benefits and other related plant
consolidation costs.  The consolidation was completed in fiscal 1994 and
asset write-offs and cash outlays were consistent with amounts originally
provided.  The Company also took a $9.7 million cash charge for severance
related to European cost-reduction programs.  The Company realized
approximately $14 million in combined savings from these actions in fiscal
1994 and anticipates $20 million in annualized savings in fiscal 1995.

In fiscal 1992, the Company discontinued certain product lines, resulting in
non-cash asset write-offs of $10.0 million.

In fiscal 1994, the Company realized a $9.8 million gain on the sale of a
business in Venezuela.  In fiscal 1993, the Company realized a $17.4 million
gain on the sale of two Italian businesses and a $10.4 million gain on
the sale of a business in the United Kingdom.  In fiscal 1992, the Company
realized an $11.0 million gain on the sale of the Ghirardelli chocolate
business.

The consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 1993 and 1992 included the
reclassification of $50.0 million of short-term debt to long-term debt,
reflecting the Company's intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-
term basis.  See Note 7 for further discussion of long-term debt issued in
fiscal 1994.

The Company has Revolving Credit Agreements totaling $350.0 million with
various banks that support its commercial paper borrowings and are also
available for direct borrowings.  The first $175.0 million facility
requires a commitment fee of one-eighth of one percent per annum, generally
payable on any available and unused portion.  The facility expires no sooner
than November 1996.  The maturity will be automatically extended for
one-year periods unless otherwise determined by the various banks.  The
Company anticipates that the facility will be extended beyond November
1996.  The second $175.0 million facility requires a commitment fee of
one-tenth of one percent per annum payable on any available and unused
portion.  The second facility expires in November 1994.  The Company
anticipates that this facility will also be extended for an additional year
upon its maturity.  As of June 30, 1994, the Company had $89.6 million
of borrowings outstanding, at market interest rates, under the second
facility.  Under the most restrictive terms of the Revolving Credit
Agreements, the Company must maintain total shareholders' equity greater
than $300.0 million.

The Company has an Adjusted Principal Revolving Credit Agreement.  Each
quarter, the Company may borrow a predetermined amount from $4.0 million
up to $41.0 million.  The amount borrowed may be repaid based upon an index
of foreign currency rates.  The Agreement is in effect through fiscal 1996
and bears interest at market rates in effect at the time of each borrowing.
The Company borrowed the available amount each quarter in fiscal 1994.

The Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have additional committed lines of
credit of $31.7 million, of which $22.2 million was utilized as of
June 30, 1994.

During fiscal 1994, the Company issued $200.0 million of Series C Medium-term
Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 6.5 percent to 7.48 percent per
annum with maturities from 10 to 30 years.  The debt was issued under a
$600.0 million shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in January 1990.  No other securities have been issued under
the shelf registration.

The non-interest bearing installment note for $55.5 million has an
unamortized discount of $51.0 million, $51.5 million and $52.0 million as of
June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, based on an imputed interest rate
of 13 percent.


Note 8
Capital Stock

During fiscal 1994, three million shares of the Company's outstanding common
stock were repurchased for $209.6 million under a five million share
repurchase program announced in August 1993.

The Company is authorized to issue 10 million shares of preferred stock in
series, with terms fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.  One
million shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock have been
reserved for issuance in connection with the Shareholder Rights Plan
(see Note 11).

An additional 1,750,000 shares of Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock
(Series B Stock) have been reserved for issuance in connection with the
Company's ESOP plan.  As of June 30, 1994, 1,282,051 shares of the Series
B Stock had been issued and are each convertible into 1.0788 shares
of the Company's common stock.  The Series B Stock will be issued only
for the ESOP and will not trade on the open market.

The Company is also authorized to issue one million shares of redeemable
preference stock, none of which had been issued as of June 30, 1994.

Note 9
Deferred Compensation

The ESOP was established to issue debt and to use the proceeds of such debt
to acquire shares of the Company's stock for future allocation to ESOP
participants.  The ESOP borrowings are included as long-term debt on the
Company's consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 7 for amounts and terms
of the ESOP notes.

Deferred compensation of $224.3 million as of June 30, 1994 primarily
represents the Company's payment of future compensation expense related to
the ESOP.  As the Company makes annual contributions to the ESOP, these
contributions, along with the dividends accumulated on the common and
preferred stock held by the ESOP, are used to repay the outstanding loans.
As the loans are repaid, common and preferred stock are allocated to ESOP
participants and deferred compensation is reduced by the amount of the
principal payment on the loans.
<TABLE>
The following table presents the ESOP loan repayments:

As of June 30, 1994, 2,135,436 shares of common stock and 400,933 shares of
preferred stock were held in the accounts of ESOP participants.


Note 10
Employee Stock Option and Award Plans

In fiscal 1990, the Company's shareholders approved the adoption of The
Quaker Long Term Incentive Plan of 1990 (the "Plan").  The purpose of the
Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by
providing the officers and other key employees with additional incentive
and the opportunity through stock ownership to increase their proprietary
interest in the Company and their personal interest in its continued success.
The Plan provides for benefits to be awarded in a variety of ways, with stock
options being used most frequently.  Nine million shares of common stock have
been authorized for grant under the Plan.  Previously, stock options were
issued under the 1984 Long Term Incentive Plan, which expired by its terms
on December 31, 1990.

Stock options may be granted for the purchase of common stock at a price
not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  Portions of the
fiscal 1992 and 1993 option awards were granted at exercise prices higher
than the fair market value on the date of grant.  Options are generally
exercisable after one or more years and expire no later than 10 years from
the date of grant.  As of June 30, 1994, 691 persons held such options.
Changes in stock options outstanding were as follows:

</TABLE>

As of June 30, 1994, options for 3,398,920 shares were exercisable and the
average per share option price of unexercised options expiring during the
period January 1995 to September 2003 was $63.95.

In July 1991, the number and exercise price of all options outstanding were
adjusted for the Fisher-Price spin-off.  This adjustment increased the number
of options outstanding by 293,241 and decreased the exercise price of the
options outstanding by approximately 8 percent.

Under the Plan, restricted stock awards grant shares of the Company's common
stock to key officers and employees.  These shares are subject to a
restriction period from the date of grant, during which they may not be sold,
assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered.  The number of shares of the
Company's common stock awarded were 23,200, 70,800 and 24,000 in fiscal
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Restrictions on these awards lapse after
a period of time designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors.

Note 11
Shareholder Rights Plan

The Company's Shareholder Rights Plan, adopted July 9, 1986 and amended
July 12, 1989, is designed to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics and
to prevent a person or group from gaining control of the Company without
offering a fair price to all shareholders.

Under the terms of the Shareholder Rights Plan, all common shareholders
of record on July 30, 1986 received for each share owned one "Right"
entitling them to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $300.

The Rights become exercisable:  (1) 10 days after a public announcement that
a person or group has acquired shares representing 20 percent or more of
the voting power of the Company's capital stock; (2) 10 business days
following commencement of a tender offer for more than 20 percent of such
voting power; or (3) 10 business days after a holder of at least 15 percent
of such voting power is determined to be an adverse person by the Board of
Directors.  The time periods can be extended by the Company.

Unless the Board of Directors has made a determination that any person is an
adverse person, the Company can redeem the Rights for $.05 per Right at
any time prior to their becoming exercisable.  The Rights will expire on
July 30, 1996, unless redeemed earlier by the Company.

If after the Rights become exercisable the Company is involved in a merger
or other business combination at any time when there is a holder of 20
percent or more of the Company's stock, the Rights will then entitle holders,
upon exercise of the Rights, to receive shares of common stock of the
acquiring company with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
each Right.  Alternatively, if a 20 percent holder acquires the Company by
means of a reverse merger in which the Company and its stock survive, or
if any person acquires 20 percent or more of the Company's voting power or
acquires 15 percent of the Company's voting power and is determined by the
Board of Directors to be an adverse person, each Right not owned by such 20
percent shareholder or adverse person would, upon exercise of the Right,
entitle the holder to common stock of the Company (or in certain circumstances
other consideration) having a market value equal to twice the exercise price
of the Right.  The Rights described in this paragraph shall not apply to an
acquisition, merger or consolidation which is determined by a majority of the
Company's independent directors, after consulting one or more investment
banking firms, to be fair and otherwise in the best interest of the Company
and its shareholders.


Note 12
Pension Plans

The Company has various pension plans covering substantially all U.S.
employees and certain foreign employees.  Plan benefits are based on
compensation paid to employees and their years of service.  Company policy is
to make contributions to its U.S. plans within the maximum amount deductible
for Federal income tax purposes.  Plan assets consist primarily of equity
securities and government, corporate and other fixed-income obligations.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions and Other
Postemployment Benefits

The Company has various postretirement health care plans covering
substantially all U.S. employees and certain foreign employees.  The plans
provide for the payment of certain health care and life insurance benefits for
retired employees who meet certain service-related eligibility requirements.
The Company funds only the plans' annual cash requirements.

Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted FASB Statement #106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  This statement
requires that the expected cost of these benefits be charged to expense during
the years that the employees render service.  The statement was adopted
through a cumulative pretax charge of $205.5 million, or $125.4 million after-
tax, which represents the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
years prior to fiscal 1993.  The incremental effect on fiscal 1993 operating
income of adopting FASB Statement #106 was a pretax charge of $14.8
million.  Cash expenditures are not affected by this accounting change.

</TABLE>

If the health care trend rates were increased one percentage point, the
current-year postretirement benefit costs would have been $2.5 million
higher and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
June 30, 1994 would have been $34.2 million higher.

Effective July 1, 1994, the Company adopted FASB Statement #112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  The cumulative effect of adoption
is a $4.1 million after-tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.  The
adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on operating
results or cash flows in future years.

Income Taxes

Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted FASB Statement #109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," which requires an asset and liability approach to
financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.  The cumulative effect
of adopting FASB Statement #109 was to increase fiscal 1993 net income by
$9.9 million.

Provisions for income taxes on income before cumulative effect of accounting
changes were as follows:

As of June 30, 1994, the Company had $63.9 million of operating and capital
loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of certain
international subsidiaries.  These loss carryforwards must be utilized
within the carryforward periods of these international jurisdictions.  The
majority of loss carryforwards have no expiration restrictions.
Those with restrictions expire primarily in five years.  A valuation
allowance has been provided for a portion of the deferred tax assets
related to the loss carryforwards.

Included in the other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were
deferred tax assets of $91.0 million, $52.3 million and $57.3 million as of
June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Income taxes paid in fiscal
1994, 1993 and 1992 were $163.9 million, $213.3 million and $182.1 million,
respectively.


Note 18
Financial Instruments

Financial instruments are primarily used to fund working capital requirements
and to reduce the impact of foreign currency rate and commodity price
fluctuations.  The main financial instruments used are short-term and
long-term debt instruments, foreign exchange forward contracts, purchased
foreign currency options and commodity options and futures contracts.

The foreign currency hedge instruments are used to reduce the risk that
the U.S. dollar value of the net investment and cash flows of foreign
operations will be reduced as exchange rates decline.  Similarly, the
commodity hedge instruments are used to reduce the risk that raw material
purchases will be adversely affected as commodity prices change.  While the
hedge instruments are subject to the risk of loss from exchange rate
movement or changing commodity prices, the losses would generally be
offset by expected gains on translation of the net investments or lower
costs of the purchases being hedged.  The Company does not trade these
instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the exchange
rate or commodity price fluctuations alone, nor does it trade in currencies
or commodities for which there are no underlying exposures.  Management
believes that its use of financial instruments to reduce risk is in the
Company's best interest.

<TABLE>
The Company's significant net investments, net hedges and net exposures in
foreign currencies subject to the hedging program as of June 30, 1994 were
as follows:
<CAPTION>

Italian lira     $56.2         $(47.5)        $8.7

</TABLE>
The Company actively monitors the net exposures and adjusts the hedge
amounts as appropriate.  The net hedges are stated above on an after-tax
basis as the Company manages the exposures on an economic basis.
The net exposures are subject to gain or loss if foreign currency exchange
rates fluctuate.  On a consolidated basis, a gain or loss would be
recognized as an increase or decrease in the cumulative translation
adjustment account on the consolidated balance sheet, but future
reported income would not be effected.  In some countries, mainly in
Latin America, foreign currency hedge instruments are not available or
are cost prohibitive.  The exposures in these countries are addressed
through managing net asset positions and borrowing in local currency
or investing in U.S. dollars.

As of June 30, 1994 and 1993, the Company had net foreign exchange forward
contracts to sell $142.5 million and $225.5 million, respectively, of
European and Canadian currencies to hedge its net investments.  These
contracts generally mature in less than two years, except for contracts to
sell $7.7 million in British pounds in fiscal 1998.  Unrealized (losses)
gains on these foreign exchange forward contracts as of June 30, 1994 and 1993
were $(4.0) million and $10.3 million, respectively.  The carrying value of
these contracts approximates fair value.

In fiscal 1988, the Company swapped $15.0 million of long-term debt for
27.9 million in deutsche mark (DM) denominated long-term debt.  The DM
swap agreement requires the Company to re-exchange 27.9 million DM for
$15.0 million in August 1997 and to make semiannual interest payments
of 0.9 million DM through August 1997.  The DM swap was included in
long-term debt as of June 30, 1994 and 1993 for $17.5 million and
$16.3 million, respectively.  The long-term debt is marked to market as
the U.S. dollar/DM exchange rate changes.  The debt swap has been effective
as a hedge of the net investment in Germany and the resulting increase or
decrease in long-term debt has been charged or credited to the
cumulative translation adjustment account on the consolidated

63


The Quaker Oats Company and Subsidiaries


balance sheet.  The interest payments are subject to exchange rate
fluctuations, but the effect on the Company's consolidated income statement
has not been material.  In late fiscal 1994, the net investment in Germany
was reduced to the point where the DM swap was no longer effective as a net
investment hedge, requiring the mark to market adjustment to
be charged to the consolidated income statement.  To offset this charge,
the Company entered into a foreign exchange forward contract and the net
effect on the consolidated income statement for fiscal 1994 was not material.

The Company uses options to hedge currency fluctuations on certain
anticipated purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
As of June 30, 1994 and 1993, the Company had options to sell Italian
lire and purchase U.S. dollars for $77.0 million and $91.2 million,
respectively.  Deferred unrecognized losses related to these options were
$9.0 million and $6.9 million as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The fair values of outstanding purchased foreign exchange options as of
June 30, 1994 and 1993, based on broker quotes, were $2.7 million and
$3.3 million, respectively.

Included in the consolidated income statements were gains of $1.1 million
and $6.2 million in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively, from foreign
currency hedge instruments.

The Company uses commodity options and futures contracts to reduce
its exposure to commodity price changes.  The Company regularly hedges
purchases of oats, corn, soybeans, wheat, coffee beans and orange juice
concentrate.  Of the $2.93 billion in cost of goods sold, approximately
$200 million to $250 million is in commodities that may be hedged.  The
Company's strategy is to typically hedge most of the production requirements
for the following twelve-month period.  As of June 30, 1994, approximately
two-thirds of fiscal 1995 production requirements were hedged.  Deferred
unrecognized losses related to commodity options and futures contracts as of
June 30, 1994 were $4.4 million.  Deferred unrecognized gains as of
June 30, 1993 were $0.4 million.  Realized losses charged to cost of goods
sold in fiscal 1994 and 1993 were $0.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
The fair values of these commodity instruments as of June 30, 1994 and 1993,
based on quotes from brokers, were net gains of $7.3 million and net losses
of $1.0 million, respectively.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt
approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of the
instruments.  The fair value of long-term debt was $779.7 million and
$730.7 million as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, which was
based on market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current
rates offered to the Company for similar debt of the same maturities.
The carrying value of long-term debt as of June 30, 1994 and 1993 was
$759.5 million and $632.6 million, respectively.

The counterparties to the Company's financial instruments are major
financial institutions.  The Company continually evaluates the
creditworthiness of the counterparties and has never experienced, nor
does it anticipate nonperformance by any of its counterparties.


Note 19
Litigation

On December 18, 1990, Judge Prentice H. Marshall of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued a memorandum
opinion stating that the Court would enter judgment against the Company in
favor of Sands, Taylor & Wood Co.  The Court found that the use of the words
"thirst aid" in advertising Gatorade thirst quencher infringed the
Plaintiff's rights in the trademark THIRST-AID.  On July 9, 1991, Judge
Marshall entered a judgment of $42.6 million, composed of $31.4 million in
principal, plus prejudgment interest of $10.6 million and fees, expenses and
costs of $0.6 million.  The order enjoined use of the phrase "THIRST-AID" in
connection with the advertising or sale of Gatorade thirst quencher in the
United States.  The Company subsequently appealed the judgment.  On
September 2, 1992, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated the
monetary award component of the District Court's judgment.  The appellate
court affirmed the finding of infringement, but found that the monetary award
was an inequitable "windfall" to the Plaintiff.  The case was remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings.  The Company filed a request for
rehearing that was denied.  The Company also filed a Petition for
Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court that was denied.  On June 7, 1993,
Judge Marshall issued a judgment on remand of $26.5 million, composed of
$20.7 million in principal, prejudgment interest of $5.4 million and fees,
expenses and costs of $0.4 million.  The Company has appealed this judgment
to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  Management, with advice
from outside legal counsel, has determined that the unrecognized loss in this
case, if any, will not be material to the consolidated financial statements
of the Company.

The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings or
environmental clean-up actions that it believes will have a material
adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Report of Independent Public Accountants


To the Shareholders of The Quaker Oats Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Quaker
Oats Company (a New Jersey corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994,
1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of The Quaker Oats
Company and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As indicated in Note 13 and Note 17, effective July 1, 1992, the Company
changed their accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions
and income taxes.

Report of Management

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the Company's
financial statements.  The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily
include some amounts that are based on management's estimates and judgment.

To fulfill its responsibility, management maintains a strong system of
internal accounting controls, supported by formal policies and procedures
that are communicated throughout the Company.  Management also maintains
a staff of internal auditors who evaluate the adequacy of and investigate
the adherence to these controls, policies and procedures.

Our independent public accountants, Arthur Andersen & Co., have audited the
financial statements and have rendered an opinion as to the statements'
fairness in all material respects.  During the audit, they obtain an
understanding of the Company's internal control systems and perform tests
and other procedures to the extent required by generally accepted auditing
standards.

The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role with respect to the
Company's financial statements through the Audit Committee, which is
composed solely of non-management directors.  The Committee meets
periodically with the independent public accountants, internal auditors and
management to assure that all are properly discharging their
responsibilities.  The Committee approves the scope of the annual audit and
reviews the recommendations the independent public accountants have for
improving internal accounting controls.  The Board of Directors, on
recommendation of the Audit Committee, engages the independent public
accountants, subject to shareholder approval.

Both Arthur Andersen & Co. and the internal auditors have unrestricted
access to the Audit Committee.

Exhibit 99

Events (Unaudited) Subsequent to the Date of Auditors'
Report

The following events occurred subsequent to the release of the 1994 Annual
Report to Shareholders.

Litigation

The following paragraph should be read in conjunction with Note 19 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 1994,
included in this Form 10-K under Exhibit 13.

On September 13, 1994, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
rendered
an opinion affirming in part and remanding in part the District Court's
judgment on remand of a $26.5 million monetary award.  The Court of Appeals
has affirmed the lower court's award of a reasonable royalty, but has again
remanded the case to allow the District Court to explain the basis for and
calculation of its royalty award.  Management, with advice from outside
legal
counsel, has determined that this opinion appears to indicate a range of
exposure between $16 million and $27 million.  The Company will record an
amount for this litigation in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.  No amount
has
previously been recorded for this matter.  The Company will petition the
Seventh Circuit for a rehearing and will consider its other options.


Two-for-one Stock Split-up

On September 14, 1994, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock
split-up, subject to the adoption by shareholders of a proposed charter
amendment which would increase the authorized shares of common stock from
200 million to 400 million.  If approved, shareholders of record on
November 9,
1994, will receive an additional share of common stock for each share held
and
all per share information would be retroactively restated.  Earnings per
share for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, assuming approval of the authorized
share increase, would have been $1.68, $1.17 and $1.63, respectively.
