                            PART I


Item 1.   BUSINESS

(a)  The Company is a Minnesota corporation, incorporated in  1906.  The
Company provides products and services  to help  people achieve, and to
measure and recognize  their achievements,  throughout  their  lives.
Products   and services  include:  yearbooks,  class  rings,  graduation
products,  student photography packages, technology-based educational
software, customized business performance and service  awards,  sports awards
and  customized  affinity products.

In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  1994,  the  Company recorded  a
restructuring charge of $69.4 million  ($45.3 million  after tax, $1 per
share), including  charges  of $60.9  million for Jostens Learning and $8.5
million  for reduced headcount   in   the  Company's   general   and
administrative   functions.   The  restructuring   charge relating  to
Jostens Learning includes $39.1  million  to focus  its  product development.
This involves abandoning certain  capitalized software and proprietary
management systems.  The remaining restructuring charge relating  to Jostens
Learning  includes $7.3  million  to  exit  both direct and indirect
investments in three ancillary  lines of  business, $4.1 million to exit the
hardware sales and service  business,  and  $10.4  million  for  work  force
reduction.

In the third quarter of fiscal 1994, the U.S. Photography business closed
leased facilities in Clinton, Mississippi and Lake Forest, California and
transferred production to owned   facilities   in  Webster,  New   York;
Jackson, Mississippi and Winnipeg, Manitoba in fiscal 1995.

In  January 1994, Jostens sold its Sportswear business to a  subsidiary of
Fruit of the Loom for $46.7  million  in cash.  Jostens  recognized an  $18.5
million  gain  ($11 million  after  tax) on the sale, primarily  because  the
Sportswear business had been written down by $15  million to  its estimated
net realizable value in the fiscal 1993 restructuring.

In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  1993,  the  Company recorded  a  $50.6
million ($33.6 million after  tax,  74 cents  per  share)  restructuring
charge  for  continuing operations.   The  charge  included  $26.7  million
for restructuring  the  U.S. Photography business,  of  which $7.9 million
related to goodwill write-offs ($5.6 million relating  to the Portrait World
acquisition in  1989  and $2.3 million in various smaller photography
intangibles), $12.8  million related to plant shutdowns and $6  million
related  primarily to write-offs of abandoned receivables from independent
sales representatives and dealers. The remaining $23.9  million of
restructuring charges included $10.2 million primarily for  headcount
reductions and  relocation  expenses;  $5 million for the write-off of
certain software development costs at Jostens Learning; and $8.7 million
primarily for sales  force restructuring and policy changes,  including write-
offs   of  abandoned  receivables  from  terminated independent    sales
representatives.  The accounts receivable  balances,  which would have
ordinarily  been collectible  in the absence of the changes in  the  sales
force,   were  abandoned  as  part  of   the   territory consolidations  and
sales force  terminations  resulting from the sales force restructuring.
Prior to reclassification,  the 1993 restructuring  also  included $15
million  to  write down the carrying  value  of  the Sportswear business to
its net realizable value. The  $15 million  related to the sale of Sportswear
in  1994  was reclassified as part of a discontinued operation.

In August 1992, the Company acquired Wicat Systems, Inc., a  provider of
technology-based learning systems for  the educational and aviation markets.
This business has been combined  with  Jostens Learning Corporation,  a
Jostens subsidiary.
               
In  June  1992,  the  Company closed its  Santa  Barbara, California  class
ring manufacturing  plant  with  those operations  consolidated  at its
facilities  in  Denton, Texas and Attleboro, Massachusetts.  The photo
processing plant  in  Anaheim, California was also closed  in  June, 1992
with that volume, as well as volume from an existing facility in Jackson,
Mississippi, transferred to a larger plant in Clinton, Mississippi.

There have been no material changes during this period in the mode in which
the Company has conducted its business.

(b)   The Company's operations are classified into  three business segments:
school-based recognition products  and services  (School Products),
technology-based educational products  and services (Jostens Learning), and
corporate recognition   and  performance  incentive  products   and services
(Recognition).   Business  segment   financial information  is  in  the
financial  statement   footnote "Business Segment Information"  on pages 39
and 40 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.


(c)   The  Company's three business segments  sell  their products  in
elementary schools, high schools,  colleges and  businesses in the fifty
states of the United  States and  some foreign countries through a sales
force of over 1,200  independent representatives and 100  direct  sales
employees  (Jostens  Learning).   In  fiscal  1994,   the Company had a
discontinued operation (Sportswear),  which manufactured and marketed
decorated sportswear to  retail and military outlets.


SCHOOL PRODUCTS SEGMENT

School   Products  recognizes  individual  and  group  achievement   and
affiliation  in  the  academic market. School  Products  comprises  five
businesses:  Printing & Publishing, Jewelry, Graduation  Products,  U.S.
Photography  and  Jostens Canada, which is the market leader  in  school
photography, yearbooks and class rings for Canadian schools.  The School
Products  segment  sales of $546.2 million in 1994 included  these  five
lines of business and $10.4 million in other sales.

Printing  &  Publishing:  Jostens manufactures and sells student-created
yearbooks  in  high  schools  and colleges.   This  product  contributed
approximately  35% of sales volume to this segment in  fiscal  1994  and 1993
and  34%  in fiscal 1992.  Independent sales representatives  work closely
with each school's yearbook staff (both students and a  faculty advisor),
assisting  with the planning, editing,  layout  and  printing scheduling
until the book is completed.  Jostens' sales representatives work  with  the
faculty advisors to renew yearbook contracts each  year. This  business also
provides commercial printing which includes printing annual reports,
brochures and promotional materials.

Jewelry:  Jostens manufactures and sells rings representing a graduating
class  primarily  to  high school and college students.    This  product
contributed  approximately 27% of the sales volume of  this  segment  in
fiscal  1994, 1993 and 1992.  Most schools permit only one  supplier  to have
access  to  its  students each year.  Rings may  be  sold  through
bookstores, other campus stores, retail jewelry stores as well as within the
school through temporary order-taking booths.  Jostens, through its
independent  sales  representatives,  manages  the  entire  process   of
interaction  with  the student through ring design, promotion,  ordering and
presentation to relieve the school officials of any  administrative burden
connected with students purchasing this symbol of achievement.

Graduation   Products:   Jostens  manufactures  and   sells   graduation
announcements,  diplomas  and  caps  and  gowns  to  both  students  and
administrators  in  high  schools  and  colleges.   This  product  group
contributed approximately 23%, 22% and 20% of sales to this  segment  in
fiscal  years  1994,  1993 and 1992, respectively.  Jostens  independent
sales  representatives make calls on schools and sales are taken through
temporary order-taking booths.

Photography:   Jostens  U.S.  provides  student  pictures   and   senior
portraits to elementary and high school students through its sales force and
dealer  network  who arrange the sittings/shootings  at  individual schools
or   in   their   own  studios.   This  business   contributed approximately
5% of sales to this segment in fiscal 1994 and 1993 and 6% in  fiscal  1992.
Jostens provides processing of  the  photos  at  the Company's plants in the
U.S. and Canada.

Jostens  Canada:  Jostens is the leader in school photography in Canada. It
also  manufactures  yearbook and class rings for  Canadian  schools. This
product group contributed approximately 8% of sales to this segment in fiscal
1994 and 9% in fiscal 1993 and 1992.

Markets:   School  Products serves elementary schools,  middle  schools, high
schools, colleges and alumni associations in the United States  and Canada
through  1,100 independent sales representatives.  Jostens  also maintains
an  international  sales force  in  about  50  countries  for American
schools and military installations.


Products:  School Products include elementary through college yearbooks,
commercial  printing, desktop publishing curriculum kits,  class  rings,
graduation  caps  and gowns, graduation announcements  and  accessories,
diplomas,  trophies,  plaques  and other awards,  individual  and  group
school  pictures,  group photographs for youth camps and  organizations, and
senior graduation portraits.

Sales Force:  The School Products segment markets its products primarily
through  independent sales representatives.  Approximately  400  persons are
dedicated  to selling class rings and graduation products,  350  to yearbooks
and 350 to photography.

Seasonality:   This  product segment experiences  a  strong  seasonality
concurrent with the school year with 40-45% of full-year sales occurring in
the  fourth quarter.  In addition, the business requires  short-term
financing during the course of the fiscal year.

Competition:   The  business of the School Products  segment  is  highly
competitive, primarily in the pricing, product development and marketing
areas.

In  the  Class  Ring  business, the Company  has  two  primary  national
competitors:  Town  &  Country (Balfour)  and  Herff  Jones,  both  with
distribution methods similar to the Company's.  The Class Ring  business is
also served through retail jewelry stores which is dominated by  two
companies: Commitment Jewelry Company with two lines (ArtCarved  and  R.
Johns), and Town & Country with one line (Gold Lance).

In  the  Graduation  Products business, there are several  national  and
numerous  local and regional competitors who offer products  similar  to
those of the Company.

Printing  & Publishing competition is primarily made up of two  national
firms (Herff Jones and Taylor Publishing) and two smaller regional firms
(Walsworth  Publishing and Delmar Corporation).  All compete  on  price,
print  quality, product offerings and service.  Technological  offerings in
the way of computer based curriculums is becoming a more significant market
advantage.

In  the  Photography area, the Company competes with Olan Mills  in  the
U.S.,  and   Lifetouch and a variety of regional and locally  owned  and
operated photographers who process the product in small batches in  both
Canada and the U.S.

The  Company's strategy for competing with these companies is  based  on its
service  and  quality  capabilities.  On  the  basis  of  available
information,  the Company believes that it has the largest  U.S.  market
share  in the following product areas: class rings, yearbooks, diplomas,
graduation  announcements and caps and gowns,  and  the  largest  market
share of photography business in Canada.


JOSTENS LEARNING SEGMENT

Jostens  Learning  (JLC) helps teachers teach and  children  learn  with
educational software for kindergarten through grade 12. As the  nation's
largest  provider  of  curriculum software, Jostens  Learning  currently

focused primarily in the aviation and military industries.

required  and is an additional source of revenue for JLC.  JLC maintains a
force  of  approximately  600  educational  consultants  and  service
technicians which assist JLC customers on an ongoing basis.

Seasonality:   The  business of Jostens Learning Corporation  is  highly
seasonal,  reflecting  the purchasing cycles of school  systems.   As  a
result, a significant portion of this business's revenues are recognized in
the  last  quarter  of the fiscal year.  In addition,  the  business requires
short-term financing during the course of the fiscal year.

Research  and Development:  JLC has approximately 200 employees involved in
the  development  of  new software products and  modifying  existing products
for  new  applications and delivery.  JLC capitalizes  certain software

million and $22.1 million in fiscal years 1994, 1993  and 1992, respectively.

million,  $17.6  million  and $13.2 million  in  1994,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.

Competition:   JLC's  primary competitors in the  education  market  are
Computer  Curriculum Corporation (CCC), and IBM EduQuest.   The  Company
believes that its product offerings are of higher quality than those  of its
competition.

traditional  distribution  channels and  Artex  for  the  mass  discount
market.


JOSTENS, INC. -- INFORMATION REGARDING ALL BUSINESSES

Backorders:  Because of the nature of the Company's business,  generally all
orders  are  filled within a few months of the time  of  placement. However,
the School Products Segment obtains student yearbook contracts in  one
fiscal  year for a significant portion of the yearbooks  to  be delivered  in
the next fiscal year.  Often the prices of the  yearbooks are  not
established at the time of the order because the content of the books   may
not  have  been  finalized.   Subject  to  the foregoing
qualifications,  the Company estimates that as of  June  30,  1994,  the
backlog  of  orders  was approximately $244 million compared  with  $252
million a year earlier.  The Company expects most of the backlog  orders to
be confirmed and filled within the current fiscal year.

Environmental:   The  Company  does not  believe  that  compliance  with
federal,  state,  and local provisions protecting the  environment  will have
a  material  effect  upon its capital expenditures,  earnings,  or
competitive position.

Raw  Materials:   All  of  the raw materials used  by  the  Company  are
available  from several sources.  Gold is an important raw material  and
accounted  for  approximately  7%, 6%,  and  7%,  respectively,  of  the
Company's cost of products sold in the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993
and 1992.

Intellectual Property:  The Company has no patents, licenses, franchises or
concessions which are material to the Company as a whole,  but  does have  a
number of proprietary trade secrets, trademarks and  copyrights which  it
considers important.  In addition, licenses are an  important part  of
certain aspects of the Company's businesses; however, the  loss of  any
license  would  not have a material  affect  on  the  Company's operations.

Significant Customers:  No material part of any business of the  Company is
dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.

Federal  Government  Contracts:  No material portion  of  the  Company's
business  is  subject to renegotiation of profits or the termination  of
contracts  or  subcontracts  at  the  election  of  the  United   States
Government.

Employees:   At  June  30, 1994, the total number of  employees  of  the
Company   was   more   than  8,000  (not  including  independent   sales
representatives).  Because of seasonal fluctuations and  the  nature  of the
business, the number of employees tends to vary.

               (d)   The  Company's foreign sales are derived
               primarily from  operations in Canada and the United
               Kingdom. The accounts   and   operations  of  the
               Company's foreign businesses  are  not  material.
               Local  taxation,  import duties, fluctuation in
               currency  exchange  rates and restrictions on
               exportation of currencies are among risks attendant to
               foreign operations, but these risks are  not considered
               material  with  respect  to  the Company's
               business.   The  profit  margin  on  foreign sales is
               approximately the same as the profit margin  on
               domestic sales.

               EXHIBIT 1--AGREEMENT WITH H. WILLIAM LURTON

November 1, 1993


Mr. H. William Lurton
Jostens, Inc.
5501 Norman Center Drive
Minneapolis, MN  55437

Dear Bill:

This letter will set forth the terms and conditions under which you will
provide services to Jostens, Inc. following your ceasing to be a fulltime
employee of Jostens.  You will continue as an employee and receive your
current salary, benefits and perquisites through December 31, 1993.
Commencing January 1, 1994 you will begin receiving the pension and other
retirement benefits for which you are eligible.  In accordance with the
plans under which they were issued, all outstanding stock options held by
you will continue to vest through January 1, 1997 and remain exercisable
in accordance with their terms.  In addition, all employee benefits and
perquisites which you now receive will continue in accordance with the
respective plans through September 18, 1994.

From January 1, 1994 on a month-to-month basis through September 18, 1994
you will agree to advise and assist Jostens by consulting with the Board
of Directors and senior managers of Jostens as they may reasonably
request.  As compensation for such consulting services, Jostens shall pay
you at the rate of $10,000 per month to be paid on the 1st of each month.
You will receive no additional compensation for the services you perform
for Jostens as a member of the Board of Directors until September 18,
1994.  Jostens will reimburse you for reasonable expenses incurred by you
pursuant to your duties under this agreement.  Jostens will make available
to you reasonable office space and secretarial services at a location
other than at its executive offices through September 18, 1994. If such
office space and secretarial services cannot be provided at a Jostens site
other than Norman Center, then Jostens will reimburse you for such
reasonable expenses actually incurred by you.

As of January 1, 1994 you shall be retained by Jostens as an independent
consultant and shall be responsible for all required contributions and/or
taxes under federal or state laws with respect to the payments made by
Jostens to you under this agreement.  You agree that in consideration for
the payments you will receive under this agreement, you shall not during
its terms or for three years thereafter undertake any work for an entity
which competes directly or indirectly with Jostens in any of the
businesses in which it currently operates or which you are aware that it
might operate during this period.

Please acknowledge your acceptance below.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Jensen

March 31, 1994

BUSINESS RESTRICTED
PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Mr. Fred D. Bjork
5855 Long Brake Trail
Edina, MN  55439

RE:  Separation Agreement

Dear Fred:

This  letter  when  signed  by  you  confirms the  mutual  Separation  Agreement
("Agreement")   we  have  reached  regarding  your  termination  of   employment
with and retirement from Jostens, Inc. ("Jostens").

The terms of the Agreement are as follows:

     1.    You  will resign effective as of April 1, 1994 as the Executive  Vice
     President  of  Jostens.   We understand that you  intend  to  remain  as  a
     member  of  the Board of Directors of Jostens.  Your current  term  expires
     in October, 1994.
     
     2.    From  April  1,  1994 through May 31, 1994, you  will  continue  your
     employment  with  Jostens as a consultant by making yourself  available  on
     an  as-needed  basis  to  the  company as  from  time  to  time  reasonably
     requested  by  me.    This  understanding is  based  upon  your  dedicated,
     loyal  and  enthusiastic  commitment  to  fulfilling  the  responsibilities
     assigned  to  you  which we feel would be appropriate during  this  period.
     During  this  period  you  will  receive  all  of  your  current  benefits,
     perquisites and base salary.
     
     3.    You  will  continue  to  be eligible for your  full  potential  bonus
     under  your  existing Executive Annual Bonus Plan for the full fiscal  year
     1994  (if  any  is earned).  You will not be eligible for any annual  bonus
     plans beyond FY'94.
     
     4.    Commencing  June 1, 1994, you will receive separation payments  based
     on  your  current  base  salary at an annual rate of $297,330  but  payable
     semi-monthly over the next  seven (7) month period.
     
     5.    All  of  your  regular executive perquisites and  employee  benefits,
     except   for  the  short  and  long-term  disability  and  travel  accident
     insurance  coverage  which you are currently receiving,  will  continue  in
     the  same  manner as that of a full-time, active employee through  December
     31,  1994.   This  includes the following employee benefits  and  years  of
     service  credit  as  if  you  were still a  full-time  active  employee  of
     Jostens:    health   and   dental  coverage,  life   insurance,   continued
     eligibility  and  participation  in the Jostens,  Inc.  Pension  Plan  "D",
     Jostens   Supplemental  Pension  Program,  Jostens  Savings/Profit  Sharing
     Retirement  Plan  and  the Executive Supplemental Retirement  Agreement  on
     the  same  terms  and  conditions as apply to other  top  executive  senior
     officers  of  Jostens.   You  and  your dependents  will  be  eligible  for
     retiree  medical  benefits on the same terms and  conditions  as  apply  to
     other top executive senior officers of Jostens.

     6.  At the present time you have in effect two separate Long-Term Perfor-
     mance Award Agreements with Jostens, making you eligible for possible award
     payments relating to FY 1994 and FY 1995, respectively.  You will be
     eligible to receive payment (if any) pursuant to the terms of each of these
     agreements on a pro rata basis, based upon the time you are a fulltime
     employee of Jostens which for this purpose terminates on December 31, 1994.

     7.     Effective  April  1, 1994, you will convert  to  the  Company's
     current  executive  car  allowance  program.   You  will  be  eligible   to
     receive  fourteen  (14) months of this allowance benefit payable over the
     nine month period ending in December, 1994.
     
     8.    For  purposes  of  your Executive Supplemental Retirement  Agreement,
     Jostens'   Pension   Plan  "D",  Jostens'  Supplemental  Pension   Program,
     Jostens   Savings/Profit  Sharing  Retirement  Plan,  and  Jostens-provided
     life,  health  and dental coverages, we will consider your retirement  date
     from  Jostens  to  be  effective as of December  31,  1994.   Any  benefits
     under  this item 8 (or under item 5) which cannot be paid under  the  terms
     of  the  applicable  plan  shall  instead  be  paid  directly  by  Jostens.
     Attached  hereto  as Exhibit A is a schedule setting out  the  agreed  upon
     retirement benefit amount calculated under the plans designated thereon.
     
     9.    To  assist you in obtaining possible alternative employment,  Jostens
     will  pay  you  up  to  Twelve Thousand Dollars  ($12,000)  for  employment
     assistance  services.  This payment will be made directly  to  you  to  pay
     to   organizations   providing   re-employment   assistance,   outplacement
     services,  search  firms,  employment agencies  or  firms  which  might  be
     providing services for you in seeking other employment.
     
     10.   You  will be eligible to continue your financial planning benefit  on
     the  same  basis  as  it  has been provided to  you  in  the  past  through
     December 31, 1994.
     
     11.   Until  April  1,  1994,  you  will  continue  to  be  considered   an
     executive  officer  of  Jostens  for  federal  securities  rules  reporting
     purposes  and,  therefore, you will continue to  be  subject  to  the  same
     reporting requirements as you have been obligated to follow in the past.
     
     12.   For  purposes  of  your vesting and exercise rights  for   the  stock
     option  grants  you  have  been  awarded in  Jostens  stock,  you  will  be
     considered  a  full-time active employee of Jostens  through  December  31,
     1994, which date will be considered your effective retirement date.
     
     13.   In  consideration  for what Jostens has agreed  to  provide  you   as
     identified above, you agree:

     a. That you will not, subsequent to your employment with Jostens,
				 divulge, furnish, or make accessible to anyone any confidential 
					proprietary information of Jostens or any of its subsidiary or affiliated
				 companies.
     
     b. That you will not solicit or entice current Jostens employees or sales
     representatives to accept employment with you or any new employer with whom
     you may become associated.
     
     c.  That, until June 1, 1996, you will not directly or indirectly,
     become employed by, act as an agent for, or establish your own business
     in competition with any products or services of Jostens or any of its 
     subsidiaries.  Should you breach this paragraph, Jostens shall be 
     entitled to terminate any unpaid monies that may be due you under item 4 of
     this Agreement and shall have the right to recover any payments made to you
     under item 4 of this Agreement during
     such breach. The only other competition restrictions that will apply to
     you are the provisions of Section 11 of the Executive Supplemental 
     Retirement Agreement, which shall apply only to payments under that
     agreement.
     
     d. You agree to release and forever discharge Jostens, its officers,
     directors, agents and employees from and to waive all causes of action,
     damages, liability and claims of whatever nature relating to or arising 
     out of your employment with Jostens and the cessation
     of that employment including, but not limited to, claims under federal, 
     state, or local discrimination laws, and the Age Discrimination in 
     Employment Act, provided however, that
     nothing herein shall release or discharge Jostens or you from obligations 
     under this Agreement or which arise after the date you sign this Agreement.
                         
     e.  To return all company property  not  otherwise provided for herein, 
     including keys, credit cards, and cash advances before May 31, 1994.
     
     14.   You  will use your best efforts to defend your interests and Jostens
     in  any  pending litigation, including, but not limited
     to Ross  Larson    v. Jostens,  Inc., et al., and will
     cooperate with Jostens and  its  attorneys to  that
     end.   At Jostens' request, you also will cooperate
     with  Jostens in  any  future  claims  or  lawsuits
     involving  Jostens  where  you  have knowledge  of the
     underlying facts.  Jostens agrees to indemnify  and
     hold you  harmless  from  any  and  all claims or
     actions  brought  against  you based  upon  your
     service as an officer or employee  of  Jostens,  to
     the full  extent  permitted  by and in the manner
     permissible  under  Minnesota law.   Specifically,
     Jostens will continue to defend and indemnify  you in
     the matter of Ross Larson v. Jostens, et al.

     15.   Jostens  will require any successor (whether
     direct or  indirect,     by purchase,  merger,
     consolidation or otherwise)  to  all  or  substantially
     all  of  the  business  and/or assets of Jostens to
     expressly  assume  and agree  to  perform  this
     Agreement in the same  manner  and  to  the  same
     extent  that  Jostens would be required to perform if
     no  such  succession had taken place.
     
     This  Agreement  shall  inure  to the benefit  of  and
     be  enforceable    by your   personal   or  legal
     representatives,  executors,   administrators,
     successors,   heirs,   distributees,  devisees  and
     legatees.   If you should  die  while  any  amounts would still be
     payable  hereunder  as   if you   had   continued   to
     live,  all  such  amounts,   unless otherwise
     provided  herein,  shall  be paid in accordance  with
     the  terms  of  this Agreement   to  your  wife  or,
     if  there  be  no  such  wife, to your estate.

     16.   This  Agreement  contains the entire agreement
     and  understanding      of the  parties  and  no
     representations have been made  or  relied  upon      by
     either  party  other than those that are expressly set forth
     herein.  This Agreement  may not be altered, modified or amended
     unless done  in  writing and signed by you and an officer of Jostens.
     
     You  acknowledge  that  you  have  been given up  to twenty-one  (21)
     days  to consider   this   Agreement and have  been   advised   and
     have had the opportunity to consult  legal  counsel  of  your  own
     choosing concerning this  Agreement  and  that  you
     have entered into  it  of  your    own  free  will and
     without compulsion.

     You  have  the  right  to  rescind  that portion  of
     this  waiver  and  release which   deals  with  charges
     or  claims  brought  pursuant  to  the Minnesota Human
     Rights  Act  or  the  Age  Discrimination  in
     Employment  Act   within fifteen   (15)   days   from
     the  date  you  sign  this    Agreement.  To be
     effective,  this  recision  must be in writing  and
     hand  delivered  or  mailed to  Jostens,  Inc.  to  the
     attention of  Orville E.  Fisher,  Jr.  within  the 15
     day  period.  If  mailed,  the recision must  be  post
     marked  within  the 15  day  period,  and  be  properly
     addressed  to  Jostens,  Inc.,  5501  Norman Center
     Drive,   Minneapolis,   Minnesota   55437, Attention:
     Orville    E. Fisher,  Jr.  and  sent  by  certified
     return receipt  requested.   Recision         of the
     release   will   result  in  cessation  of  all
     payments   and   benefits provided by Jostens pursuant
     hereto.

     If  this  Agreement  and  the  conditions  contained
     herein  are  agreeable to you,   please  sign  and
     return  this  letter  to  me  within  twenty-one  (21)
     days  or  as  soon  as  possible,  thereby noting  your

To Our Investors:

Fiscal 1994 was a year of rapid change and transition for Jostens. Action on
several strategic fronts helped set the foundation for a return to a period of
sustainable, profitable growth. However, the substantial progress we made
preparing for the future was not reflected in the company's fiscal 1994
financial performance. In the year ended June 30, Jostens reported a net loss
of $16.2 million, or 36 cents per share. The loss included several items that
reduced after-tax earnings by $45.2 million, or $1 per share. Among those
items were restructuring charges to address critical issues at Jostens
Learning, our curriculum software subsidiary, and to remove management layers
from our corporate organization.

Despite our 1994 financial performance, we are encouraged by the signifi cant
steps we took throughout the year to identify and resolve the problems that
led to the company's poor results over the last two years. Those steps, which
are discussed in more detail on following pages, enabled us to enter fiscal
1995 with our major issues confined to one business, Jostens Learning. The
rest of the company is performing well, and we believe Jostens is turning the
corner.

Business Review. The company's most significant problem in fiscal 1994 was
Jostens Learning, which continued to underperform expectations in sales and
profitability. However, management has worked aggressively to identify the
issues and determine a solution. In March, we completed an in-depth analysis
of Jostens Learning and the educational technology marketplace. From that
review, management developed a restructuring plan. Implementation of the plan
began as the fiscal year closed. In essence, we will pare the Jostens Learning
organization and refocus it on the kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum
software market with products that meet various customer demands. This
repositioning will be completed over the next few years.

The more traditional businesses of Jostens performed well in fiscal 1994. The
Recognition segment had strong improvements in sales and profitability. The
business landed several new large accounts and increased sales to current
customers. Profitability also improved in the School Products segment. In
Jewelry, we introduced four new ring designs, and Graduation Products moved
forward with steps to improve efficiency through technology. In Printing &
Publishing, cycle-time improvements enabled Jostens to deliver yearbooks on
time, even as severe weather led our competitors to miss delivery deadlines.
We built on that success by winning hundreds of new accounts for 1995. The
U.S. Photography business consolidated its manufacturing facilities and
brought forward a plan for a profitable future. In Canada sales and profits
were stable despite a difficult economy, but declined when translated into
U.S. dollars.

Portfolio Moves. We divested a number of businesses that no longer fit our
core expertise and strategic focus on school and corporate markets. The
largest transaction was the January sale of our Sportswear business to Fruit
of the Loom for $46.7 million. In early fiscal 1995 we completed the sale of
two business interests that no longer fit Jostens Learning's strategy. Our
portfolio will include only businesses that fall within our core expertise and
that can provide both growth and superior returns. We will manage our
portfolio to those measurements.

Cultural Change. Fiscal 1994 marked the beginning of major cultural changes at
Jostens, changes that reflect the fierce competitiveness required to succeed
in business today. As an organization, we're working to become more agile and
dynamic, to make decisions based on hard research, to better understand the
needs and tastes of our consumers, and to seize opportunities to improve and
expand.

We are also reengineering our business processes by streamlining the
organization, eliminating tasks that don't add value and utilizing technology
to help make us more efficient and effective. Leading all of these changes is
a new management team built in the last two years. In fiscal 1994, Robert P.
Jensen was elected to succeed H. William Lurton as chairman of Jostens.
Following a national candidate search, the board in March promoted Robert C.
Buhrmaster to president and CEO. We have added senior executives in areas
critical to fueling growth and shareholder value - such as information
systems, marketing and quality and we installed new leadership in several
business units. Although the team has been together a relatively short time,
it is driving the improvements needed to position Jostens for the future.
Responding to new leadership, the people of Jostens embraced change and
performed admirably in 1994, and we thank them.
In early fiscal 1995 we welcomed a new member to the Board of Directors.
Mannie L. Jackson is senior vice president-corporate marketing and
administration for Honeywell Inc. and chairman and CEO of Harlem Globetrotters
International.

The Future. Jostens will continue changing in 1995, as initiatives begun in
1994 take hold. The Jostens Learning repositioning will move forward. We will
carry reengineering through our work processes in corporate functions and
businesses. And, as we complete the repair of our foundation, we will devote
more attention and resources to developing new products that appeal to our
customers' changing tastes.

Jostens enters fiscal 1995 in much better shape than a year ago. Our
businesses are leaders in their markets.The traditional businesses are
functioning well, and we are implementing a plan to return Jostens Learning to
profitability. In 1994, our company stepped up to tough but necessary
decisions to prepare Jostens for the future. We believe shareholders will see
some tangible results of those efforts in fiscal 1995.

FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH

Fiscal 1994 was a rebuilding year for Jostens. The company undertook a series
of actions to repair its foundation in order to support renewed sales and
earnings growth in the future. Management's approach is to: (1) fix problem
areas, (2) restructure businesses to capture efficiencies and create
competitiveness and (3) rejuvenate each area through new products and new
market or business opportunities. The fix phase is nearing completion and many
areas are well along with the restructuring phase, while the rejuvenation
challenge is primarily ahead. Fiscal 1994 financial results reflect the cost
of implementing seven major initiatives to restore the company's foundation.
While many were painful in the short term, each initiative represents a key
building block needed to support sustainable, profitable growth in the future.

Jostens Learning Repositioning. The company's most pressing issue in 1994 was
Jostens Learning, which provides curriculum software to schools. Declines at
Jostens Learning have been primarily responsible for the overall profitability
declines at Jostens in the last two years. Following a comprehensive review of
Jostens Learning and the education marketplace, management created a
repositioning plan for the business. With this plan, detailed later in this
report, the company anticipates Jostens Learning will return to profitability
in fiscal 1996.

Sportswear Sale. In January, Jostens completed the sale of its Sportswear
business to Fruit of the Loom. Sportswear products, once sold through college
bookstores, were increasingly moving to market through retail outlets. The
move off campus meant Sportswear no longer fit the company's strategic focus
on schools and corporations.

U.S. Photography Restructuring. Jostens implemented a plan to restructure the
U.S. Photography business, reduce costs and provide sound footing for a
profitable future. In March, photo processing facilities were consolidated to
improve efficiency. The business plans to improve market position and
competitiveness by developing new products and employing digital imaging
technology, some of which was tested with customers in fiscal 1994. As a
result of the restructuring, U.S. Photography improved its performance
dramatically in 1994 and is well positioned for a return to profitability in
1995.

Process Reengineering. The company began reengineering its business pro cesses
in fiscal 1994. The objectives are to improve service, increase efficiency,
improve quality, shorten cycle times and reduce costs. Initial reengineering
efforts identified savings opportunities of between $8 million and $10 million
in overhead functions alone - nearly halfway toward the company's target of
cutting overhead expenses by $20 million to $25 million in the next three
years. Reengineering is also under way in manufacturing areas.

Organization Streamlining. The School Products Group (SPG) structure was
eliminated and former SPG overhead functions - such as finance, human
resources and information systems - were combined with corporate functions.
The integration, completed in July 1994, cut three layers from the
organization and increased by 50 percent the average number of people
reporting to each manager. It also eliminated about 150 positions.

Accounting Revisions. The company thoroughly reviewed its accounting policies
and practices in 1994 and made revisions in a number of areas to ensure a
realistic but conservative approach, based on changing business conditions, to
accounting policies and practices across all units of the organization. 

New Management Team. In fiscal 1994, the Board of Directors elected Robert P.
Jensen, an outside director, to chairman and elected Robert C. Buhrmaster
president and chief executive officer. Buhrmaster, who joined Jostens in late
1992 as chief staff officer and was promoted to president and chief operating
officer in June 1993, has led the creation of a new leadership team. The new
team is a blend of executives new to Jostens and those with years of
experience with the company.

New appointments during the year were: Charles W. Schmid, senior vice
president and chief marketing officer; G. Nichols Simonds, vice president and
chief information officer; Greg S. Lea, vice president-total quality
management; R. Rick Prather, president of the Recognition segment; Trudy A.
Rautio, vice president and controller; and Stanley E. Sanderson Jr., president
and chief executive officer of the Jostens Learning segment. The new team is
making the structural, process and cultural changes required to generate and
support renewed growth.

The Future. The future will bring additional management focus on growth
opportunities in areas of Jostens' core expertise - helping people achieve,
and recognizing and rewarding their achievements in schools and businesses.
Management believes the company's businesses have significant top- and bottom
line growth potential that can be realized through a combination of factors:
utilizing technology to be more competitive; relying on fact-based market
research; gaining a better understanding of customer tastes, wants and
requirements; and generating new products that excite the marketplace.

Fundamental Strengths. Underlying management's actions are the company's
fundamental strengths, which provide a solid base for the future.

Financial: Jostens remains financially strong. Debt-to-total capitalization
at year end was a healthy 18 percent - virtually unchanged over the last
several years. In 1994, two major credit rating agencies,
Moody's and Standard & Poor's, reaffirmed their A2 and A+ ratings of Jostens'
long-term debt. In addition, Jostens generated strong cash flow and
significantly improved working capital management last year.

Market leadership: Jostens is first or second in market share in virtually all
its businesses - and in several cases has a 40 percent or greater share of the
market. Management sees opportunities to further strengthen share and to use
that market strength to introduce new products and pursue new markets.

Jostens name: The Jostens name is widely recognized in schools and
corporations throughout the United States and Canada as a symbol of quality,
service and value.

Sales force: A network of about 1,300 sales representatives enables Jostens to
become a partner with customers and decision makers - whether they are
business executives, students, parents or school administrators. These
relationships provide opportunities for Jostens to understand specific
customer needs and create customized, value-added solutions, products and
services.

Custom manufacturing: The company specializes in crafting programs, prod ucts
and services to meet the needs of each customer, adding value above and beyond
the product alone.

Commitment to education: In addition to
education-oriented products, the company offers the Jostens Renaissance
program to engage administrators, teachers, students and the business
community in a process of promoting and recognizing academic achievement. More
than 4,500 schools in the United States use Jostens Renaissance methods, which
have resulted in better test scores, higher attendance and fewer disciplinary
problems. The company also provides grants and other programs to support
education.

The transition of Jostens will continue in 1995. As the company's businesses
move from the fix and restructure phases to rejuvenation, specific growth
strategies are being developed. All areas of the company will benefit from
actions taken in fiscal 1994 and will be supported by a restored foundation
based on fundamental strengths.


School Products

Jostens' School Products businesses - Printing & Publishing, U.S. Photography,
Jostens Canada, Jewelry and Graduation Products - are leaders in providing
products and services to schools throughout the United States and Canada. The
1994 performance of School Products, which represents 66 percent of the
corporation's sales, reflects its strength; Jostens is the marketshare leader
in virtually all School Products businesses. School Products segment sales of
$546.2 million in 1994 included the five lines of business and $10.4 million
in other sales.

Future top- and bottom-line growth in School Products is tied to a combination
of improved efficiency and new product and market opportunities. In the
efficiency area, the company is investing in technology and remaking business
processes. For example, in fiscal 1995, bar-code scanning technology will be
used to process product orders for graduation caps, gowns and announcements.
Later in the year, class ring order scanning will begin. The new system will
help improve customer service by cutting processing time and improving order
accuracy. In the product development area, 1995 will be a year of identifying
opportunities for new products and markets that appeal to the tastes of
today's young adults and that fit Jostens' expertise in manufacturing
and craftsmanship. The company anticipates that opportunities identified in
1995 will result in products for sale in 1996 and beyond.

Printing & Publishing. Printing & Publishing, which produces high school and
college yearbooks and provides commercial printing services, improved its
manufacturing efficiency and utilization in 1994 by focusing particular types
of printing jobs in specific plants, a realignment that contributed to
profitability improvement. Improvements in cycle times enabled the business to
deliver spring yearbooks on time, despite inclement weather that caused
problems for competitors. Then, based on market research and a targeted
program with the sales force, Printing & Publishing won from competitors the
accounts of more than 500 schools for fiscal 1995.
Fiscal 1994 sales were $191.7 million, up 1 percent from 1993. Printing &
Publishing is pursuing growth opportunities in high schools, middle schools
and elementary schools with products and services that meet the particular
needs of each group. In 1994, the new Memory ExpressTM yearbook was
successfully test-marketed in elementary schools and will be expanded in 1995.
A new product is scheduled for introduction to the middle school market late
in fiscal 1995, and growth in the high school market will be based on market
research to better identify changing customer needs. Printing & Publishing is
also approaching publishers to establish a presence in book printing, a market
segment that will further utilize printing capacity.

U.S. Photography. A repositioning program implemented in 1994 substantially
improved operational capabilities and profitability in the U.S. Photography
business. Developed under the leadership of the Jostens Canada team, the
repositioning included a consolidation of photo processing facilities to
improve plant utilization and better serve the North America photo processing
market. It also included a planned reduction in sales through realignment of
the dealer base. The consolidation will result in improvements in customer
response, quality and cycle times, as well as substantial cost improvements.
Fiscal 1994 sales of $27.7 million were 9 percent less than 1993, reflecting a
planned sales decline related to the repositioning program. U.S. Photography's
focus in 1995 is to continue the improvements begun in 1994, test new digital
imaging products and return the business to profitability.

Jostens Canada. Jostens Canada - the undisputed leader in school photography,
yearbooks and class rings - successfully tested new products, including some
based on digital-imaging technology, in a limited number of schools in 1994.
In addition to the traditional film method, all Jostens photo plants now have
the capability to capture, store and manipulate images in electronic form.
This capability enables processing plants to improve cycle times and develop
such products as an electronic student identification system that allows
schools to electronically record student photos and records.

A new line of class rings introduced in Canada in 1994 took advantage of a
new, exclusive computerized engraving system that enables new design styles.
The Expressions line, which was tested in Canada's Atlantic region, outsold
other more traditional styles by 10 percent. In addition, a new sports ring
program, also utilizing computerized engraving technology, is generating
volume growth. Successes included the selection of Jostens Canada to provide
rings for the Canadian Football League champion Edmonton Eskimos. Jostens
Canada is using other technology-based offerings, such as the YeartechTM
desktop publishing program, to attract new accounts and renew higher
percentages of existing accounts. Fiscal 1994 sales declined 10 percent to
$42.3 million. Canada performed solidly in 1994 in Canadian dollars, but a
weak exchange rate translated into a decrease in U.S. dollars.

Jewelry. In the Jewelry business, which provides rings and accessories for
high schools and colleges, sales were $149.1 million in 1994, up 4
percent from 1993. The number of ring designs was pared to 80 from 200 last
year, simplifying customer decisions, and the business introduced four new
ring designs - which accounted for nearly 10 percent of ring sales. In
operations, Jewelry established a team-based environment to improve
productivity and flatten its manufacturing organization.

In fiscal 1995, Jewelry expects to test with consumer panels several ideas
for new products and product extensions. The business will also continue
building a database of market research to provide the basis for new product
development. Jewelry will carry forward efforts to improve service and reduce
costs by centralizing customer service and introducing an automated system
enabling customers and sales representatives to determine the status of their
orders and accounts instantly.

Graduation Products. Graduation Products - which provides caps, gowns,
announcements and diplomas for high school and college students - had sales of
$125 million in 1994, up 7 percent from 1993. The business benefited from a
number of new programs, including the introduction of family nights to display
products for students and parents, combining various products and quantities
into package offerings, and introducing a rush-order program that allows
students to purchase graduation necessities at the last minute. Also
introduced in 1994 was Senior SalutesTM, weeklong events to provide college
students with one-stop information on caps and gowns, graduation
announcements, class rings, diploma plaques, alumni association membership,
career counseling, hotel information for families and the graduation ceremony
itself. Senior Salutes will be expanded to more schools in 1995. In 1995,
Graduation Products will automate its order-entry process, which will improve
accuracy and reduce processing time.
Recognition

The Recognition segment in 1994 took advantage of the growing need for
companies to recognize employee and business achievements amid turbulent times
for North American businesses. As a result, sales and profits in creased at
double-digit rates for Recognition, which provides service and performance
awards to companies and specialized products to professional and amateur
sports teams.During the year, Recognition began providing service under a
multi-year contract with AT&T. The business also signed
several new accounts, including PaineWebber, Avon, Miles and PPG. Sales to
current customers increased as well in 1994.Improved results reflect success
at improving operating efficiencies. Over the last three years, Recognition
operations have reduced standard manufacturing schedules by more than 50
percent. The business also cut the number of organizational levels to five
from nine and significantly increased the number of people reporting to each
supervisor.

The business is also employing technology to improve customer service. In
fiscal 1994, Jostens became the first service awards company to use
interactive voice response (IVR) systems to handle the employee service award
selection process. IVR enables a person scheduled to receive a service award
to obtain information and select the appropriate gift through a toll-free
phone call. The IVR system automatically instructs the caller how to select a
gift, then follows up with a fax message to the recipient confirming the
selection and delivery date. To ensure the event is formally recognized when
the award is delivered, the employee's supervisor is also notified at the time
of ordering. The use of IVR is being expanded in 1995, providing Jostens a
competitive advantage.

To capitalize on the growing need of companies to emphasize - and meaningfully
reward - measurable  performance improvement, the Recognition segment is
broadening its market of opportunity. Through customized programs, Jostens
helps organizations use the concept of recognition as a management tool to
drive change, motivate people, and measure and reward accomplishments.


Jostens Learning

At Jostens Learning, the company's wholly owned educational software
subsidiary, management took steps in 1994 to identify and begin resolving the
issues leading to Jostens Learning's recent performance. A comprehensive study
of Jostens Learning and the entire educational technology marketplace
concluded that Jostens Learning should focus on its strength _ providing
educational software for children in kindergarten through grade 12. From that
review, management developed and began implementing a plan to reposition the
business. Under the plan, Jostens Learning will offer a complete line of
products to meet the various needs of different customers and refocus on
providing K-12 educational software that runs on industry-standard hardware.
Jostens Learning, which currently offers more than 7,000 hours of curriculum
instruction in language arts and mathematics, is implementing a product-line
approach to pursue opportunities in five market areas:

Integrated Learning Systems. Fully integrated learning systems (ILS)
essentially provide computerized learning stations either throughout a school
or in a learning lab classroom. Individual learning stations are linked over a
network to a management system that extends the ability of teachers to
instruct each student and accurately monitor and assess student progress.
Jostens Learning remains a leader in the ILS market segment, with a market
share of about 50 percent.

In 1995, Jostens Learning plans to introduce Learning FirstTM-New Edition, a
revitalized release of its major ILS product, Learning First. Learning First
New Edition will include curriculum updates, as well as major enhancements in
graphics, sound, color and animation. The business is also developing a new
monitoring and assessment system for teachers. Sales of Learning First-New
Edition began in early fiscal 1995, with initial product deliveries scheduled
for late in the year.

Modular Products. This market segment, also referred to as mini-ILS prod ucts,
comprises schools and districts that require more focused solutions or that
can't afford the up-front investment in a full ILS. Modular products range
from free-standing products to smaller networks of learning stations. The
modular products market, although smaller than the ILS market in terms of
dollars of sales, is the fastest growing segment of the educational software
marketplace. Many school districts are moving to site-based funding, which
means schools must carefully manage their share of the district's investment
dollars. By investing in Jostens Learning's modular products, schools can over
time build fully integrated learning systems. In 1994, Jostens Learning
expanded its modular offerings with Action MathTM, a multi-media offering used
in teacher-led classroom discussions of math concepts. Jostens Learning also
offers TeachNetTM, a triad of language learning products.

Stand-Alone Products. Jostens Learning will target opportunities to build a
bridge from school to home with home-use products that complement classroom
curriculum. In fiscal 1995, Jostens Learning will test some concepts and
develop plans to profitably participate in this growing market.

Teacher Training. A new teacher training program, Training PLUS, is being
introduced to help teachers help students get the maximum benefit of Jostens
Learning curriculum. Training PLUS, which offers a core program package as
well as additional training and in-service options, is designed as a cost
effective and time-efficient approach to staff development.

Enhancements & Renewals. This market area is concerned with keeping the
installed base of Jostens Learning customers current by updating and expanding
products and by providing continuing training and support. Currently, more
than 4 million students use Jostens Learning products in 10,000 schools across
the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Introduction

This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consoli dated
operating results, financial condition and liquidity/cash flow of Jostens Inc.
during the three years ended June 30, 1994.


A number of items had an impact on the company's earnings, including: (1)
restructurings recorded in the fourth quarters of fiscal 1993 and 1994; (2)
discontinued operations; (3) changes in certain accounting estimates in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 and the third quarter of fiscal 1994; and (4)
restatement of past financial statements. Each is detailed below, following
discussion of Results of Operations, Financial Position, Capital Expenditures
and Product Development, and Dividends.


Results of Operations


Overall. For fiscal 1994, net sales from continuing operations decreased 1
percent to $827.3 million, compared with $836.4 million in fiscal 1993. Sales
in 1993 declined 3 percent from 1992 sales of $858.5 million. The company's
lower sales and earnings in fiscal 1994 resulted from a substantial shortfall
in Jostens Learning revenue. Sales price increases averaged approximately 3
percent in 1994, 2 percent in 1993 and 3 percent in 1992. Gross margins for
the company in fiscal 1994 were 48.5 percent, down from 49.2 percent in 1993
and 50.2 percent in fiscal 1992. This reflects lower margins reported in 1994
by Jostens Learning. The traditional business segments, School Products and
Recognition, improved margins through strong cost management. Lower margins
also reflect the impact of an inventory change in estimate of $3.2 million in
fiscal 1994 (see Changes in Estimates).


Selling and administrative expenses were $360.3 million in 1994, $351.6
million in 1993 and $323.6 million in 1992. These expenses, as a percentage of
sales, were 43.5 percent, 42 percent and 37.7 percent, respectively. The 1994
increase is primarily due to changes in accounting estimates of $7.7 million
for receivables and $6 million for overdrafts (see Changes in Estimates), and
a shortfall in sales at Jostens Learning. The benefits of the restructuring at
Jostens Learning and at corporate are expected to occur in fiscal 1995.

During fiscal 1994, the company sold several small parcels of land for a $1.1
million gain, and approximately broke even on disposal of its plaque facility.

Interest expense and income in fiscal 1994 compared with fiscal 1993 reflects
lower average debt levels due to the proceeds from the sale of Sportswear and
improved cash flow from operations. Interest expense and income in 1993 were
favorably affected by a reduction in outstanding debt, cash received from the
Wicat acquisition and lower short-term borrowing rates, compared with the
previous year.

Net loss for fiscal 1994 was $16.2 million, compared with a loss of $12.7
million in 1993 and net income of $59.2 million in 1992. Included in the 1994
and 1993 net losses are after-tax restructuring charges of $45.3 million and
$33.6 million, respectively; a fiscal 1993 after-tax charge of $4.2 million
associated with the early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106 for postretirement benefits; a net after-tax gain of
$10.2 million from discontinued operations in 1994; and losses of $8 million
and $1.2 million from discontinued operations in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The 1994 loss per share was 36 cents, compared with a loss per share of 28
cents in 1993 and earnings per share of $1.32 in 1992. Earnings per share from
continuing operations prior to the change in accounting principle,
discontinued operations and restructuring charges were 42 cents in fiscal
1994, compared with 73 cents in 1993 and $1.34 in 1992.

School Products Segment. Overall School Products sales increased 1 percent to
$546.2 million from $540.7 in fiscal 1993. Fiscal 1993 sales declined 1
percent from fiscal 1992. The Printing & Publishing, Jewelry and Graduation
Products businesses within this segment all posted sales gains in fiscal 1994.
Dollar sales of high school class rings increased, although the number of
units sold was essentially stable compared with fiscal 1993. College class
ring units sold declined from fiscal 1993. The Graduation Products sales
increase stemmed from increases in the buy rates among students as well as an
increase in the average amount purchased by each student. Both the Jostens
Canada and U.S. Photography businesses within this segment reported sales
declines. In Jostens Canada the unit volume was essentially flat, while
currency exchange rate fluctuations accounted for most of the decline. The
decline in U.S. Photography sales reflected a planned realignment of the
dealer base to focus on more profitable business and more closely match the
manufacturing capabilities of this business.

School Products showed operating profit improvements in fiscal 1994 due to a
combination of cost improvements and modest price increases. Overall School
Products operating profit was $73.5 million in fiscal 1994, up 83.8 percent
from $40 million in fiscal 1993, which included restructuring costs of $36.5
million. Fiscal 1993 operating profit decreased 52.9 percent from 1992.
Printing & Publishing reduced costs by improving its manufacturing efficiency
through realigning particular printing jobs in specific plants. Jewelry
improved materials and inventory management, as well as reduced the number of
ring designs. This business also changed its manufacturing organization to a
team-based environment, flattening the organization and improving
productivity. U.S. Photography took major steps to maximize plant capacity
utilization and effectiveness by closing leased facilities in Clinton, Miss.,
and Lake Forest, Calif., and transferring production to owned facilities in
Webster, N.Y., Jackson, Miss., and Winnipeg, Manitoba, effective in fiscal
1995.

The School Products segment incurred $36.5 million of restructuring charges in
fiscal 1993 (see Restructurings, Fiscal 1993). The School Products segment
also increased its reserves in inventory, accounts
receivable and overdrafts by $16.4 million in fiscal 1994 and $7.5 million in
fiscal 1993 (see Changes in Estimates).

Jostens Learning Segment. For the year, Jostens Learning sales were $177.5
million, a decrease of 12 percent from the fiscal 1993 level of $201.6
million. Fiscal 1993 sales declined 8 percent from 1992. The decline in sales
of software, hardware and service in fiscal 1994 stemmed from increased
competition for school technology funds.

Jostens Learning posted an operating loss of $84.2 million in fiscal 1994,
compared with an operating loss of $15.3 million in 1993 and operating profit
of $23.4 million in 1992. The 1994 results stemmed from the $60.9 million
restructuring charge as well as sales declines in software and service areas,
and a shift in product sales from software to hardware, which has lower
margins than software. As part of this restructuring, it is estimated the
discontinuation of product lines will decrease future annual revenues by $55
million to $70 million. Revenue from the discontinued product lines was $68
million in 1994 and $76 million in 1993. Jostens Learning also incurred $10.4
million in restructuring charges in fiscal 1993 (see Restructurings, Fiscal
1994 and Fiscal 1993).

Recognition Segment. Recognition sales were up 10 percent from fiscal 1993 to
$103.7 million. Fiscal 1993 sales declined 1 percent from 1992. Several new
accounts were added in fiscal 1994, including AT&T, and sales to current
customers also increased.


Recognition operating profit increased 10.5 percent to $9.5 million in fiscal
1994. Fiscal 1993 operating profit of $8.6 million was a 13.3 percent increase
from fiscal 1992. Improvements in fiscal 1994 came from reducing costs as well
as improving efficiency. The segment also realigned its sales force and
reduced the number of organizational levels from nine to five.


FINANCIAL POSITION

Net working capital was $172.7 million at June 30, 1994, reflecting a current
ratio of 1.8 to 1. Cash and short-term investments were
$107.8 million, up from $13.6 million the previous year, due to the sale of
the Sportswear business and improved cash flow from operations.

Accounts receivable decreased to $149.2 million from $201.2 million in 1993,
due to the sale of the Sportswear business, lower sales at Jostens Learning,
improved collections and change in estimate charges of $7.7 million (see
Changes in Estimates).

Inventories decreased to $82.6 million in 1994 from $131.2 million in 1993,
due to the sale of the Sportswear business, restructuring write-offs at
Jostens Learning, reduced computer hardware inventory levels at Jostens
Learning and change in estimate charges of $3.2 million (see Changes in
Estimates).

Prepaid expenses decreased to $6.1 million in 1994 from $10.7 million in 1993,
due to reduced royalties and commissions at Jostens Learning.

Other receivables decreased to $10.3 million in 1994 from $21.5 million in
1993 as a result of a reduction in the number of sales representatives under
contract, change in estimate charges of $6 million taken in the third quarter
of fiscal 1994 (see Changes in Estimates), and restructuring write-offs. The
reduction is also due to a tax receivable of $3.7 million included in the
fiscal 1993 balance. Fiscal 1994 current taxes are in a liability position.

Intangibles increased to $47.7 million in 1994 from $47 million in 1993. The
increase was primarily due to the establishment of intangible assets
related to additional minimum pension liability requirements of $5.5 million,
offset by amortization of $2.3 million and write-offs of $3.2 million.

Net software development costs decreased to $29.4 million in 1994 from $52.7
million in 1993. The decrease was due to amortization of $15.5 million, write
offs of $1.9 million due to the company's
application of a net realizable value analysis and $25.3 million in writeoffs
due to the restructuring, offset in part by the addition of $19.4 million of
continuing software development costs.

Net property and equipment decreased to $75.8 million in 1994 from $88.9
million in 1993, primarily due to the sales of the Sportswear busi ness, the
plaque facility and several parcels of land.

Accounts payable decreased to $33.2 million in 1994 from $54.2 million in 1993,
due to reduced hardware purchases at Jostens Learning and the sale of the
Sportswear business.

Salaries, wages and commissions increased to $68.4 million in 1994 from $62.6
million in fiscal 1993, primarily due to fiscal 1994 restructuring reserves in
excess of fiscal 1993 restructuring reserves.

Accrued pension costs increased to $19.3 million in 1994 from $8.9 million in
1993, due to a lower than expected return on pension plan assets and a
reduction in the discount rate to reflect current prevailing interest rates.

Generally, the company's cash requirements have been met with internally
generated funds and through short-term borrowings. The seasonality of the
businesses requires the interim financing of inventories and receivables.
These short-term borrowings averaged $28.6 million in fiscal 1994 and reached
a high of $87 million during the year. This compares with average short-term
borrowings of $42.6 million and $38 million in fiscal 1993 and 1992,
respectively, with highs of $83.3 million for fiscal 1993 and $93.9 million
for fiscal 1992. The average interest rate paid on these borrowings was
approximately 3.25 percent for fiscal 1994, compared with 4 percent for fiscal
1993 and 5.6 percent for fiscal 1992. Seasonal financing needs for 1995 will
be covered under comparable credit arrangements.

Shareholders' investment declined 19 percent to $256.6 million, down from
$315.7 million in 1993. This reduction is primarily attributable to dividends
and the fiscal 1994 restructuring charges. Book value at June 30, 1994, was
$5.64 per share versus $6.95 for the prior year.

Long-term debt, as a percentage of total capitalization, was 18 percent on
June 30, 1994.


CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in fiscal 1994, compared with $20.9
million in 1993. The School Products segment accounted for $6.2 million,
including computer system upgrades of $2.8 million and various other capital
improvement projects. Jostens Learning, Recognition and corporate expended $4
million, $1.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively. About $21 million in
capital additions are planned for fiscal 1995, including business systems
upgrades involving new hardware and software platforms for the School Products
segment.

Fiscal 1994 gross product development costs were approximately $32.3 million,
compared with $46.9 million in the prior year. Fiscal 1995 product development
costs are expected to be approximately $18 million. The decrease is due to the
refocusing of Jostens Learning products on
the K-12 marketplace and the conversion to one management system strategy. All
development costs will be internally funded.

DIVIDENDS

Cash dividends paid to shareholders in 1994 totaled $40 million.The annual
dividend was 88 cents per share in fiscal 1994 and 1993, up 5    percent from
the 84cents paid in fiscal 1992.

RESTRUCTURINGS

Fiscal 1994

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, Jostens recorded a total restructuring
charge of $69.4 million ($45.3 million after tax, $1 per share), consisting of
two components: Jostens Learning for $60.9 million and corporate for $8.5
million.

Jostens Learning: A change in management at Jostens Learning occurred in
September 1993, when John Kernan, its chairman and chief executive officer,
left the company.

In October 1993, Jostens engaged the management consulting firm of Bain &
Company, Inc. (Bain) to thoroughly analyze the markets in which
Jostens Learning competes, as well as Jostens Learning's position within those
markets. Bain periodically discussed its progress with management and the
Board of Directors, and presented the final results of its study to Jostens
management in March 1994. The Bain study recommended a substantial
restructuring of Jostens Learning to accomplish the objectives defined during
the evaluation process.
In March 1994, Jostens Learning hired Stanley Sanderson as its new chief
executive officer. Sanderson worked with Bain in developing a restructuring
plan intended to address the issues raised in the Bain study. Sanderson has
set a new direction for Jostens Learning that is consistent with the Bain
study, and he reviewed this direction with the company's Board of Directors in
April 1994. Management proposed and the board approved a restructuring plan
for Jostens Learning, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994.
Under the plan, Jostens Learning will focus on the K-12 market and offer
complete integrated learning systems as well as modular and stand-alone
products. Specifically, Jostens Learning will: (1) develop educational
software that runs on industry-standard systems and discontinue investments
and development in proprietary systems; (2) sell its minority investments in
education and technology companies; (3) exit the hardware business and rely on
third-party vendors to provide hardware and services; and (4) establish a new
model for providing customer training and service.
Jostens recognized a total restructuring charge related to Jostens Learning of
$60.9 million. This charge was in the following areas: product development,
$39.1 million; exit ancillary businesses, $7.3 mil lion; exit hardware sales
and services, $4.1 million; and work-
force reduction, $10.4 million.

1. Product Development: In recent years, Jostens Learning has invested heavily
  in new technologies. Jostens Learning's new strategy will return it to its
  successful core: developing software curriculum with a dedication to
  improving the delivery of instruction to children (K-12) through the
  teacher. Future products will focus on a narrower range of product offerings
  and operate from a single uniform management system, aiding the development
  process and streamlining the support and service required after the sale.
  This will result in the abandonment of certain capitalized software and a
  proprietary management system.
  
2. Exit Ancillary Businesses: Jostens Learning will exit ancillary lines of
  business in order to focus on its core business - the K-12 delivery of
  instruction. This involves selling both passive investments in other
  companies as well as operations that do not support this business strategy.
  
3. Exit Hardware Sales and Services: Jostens Learning has been in the hardware
  sales and servicing business to provide customers with "one-stop shopping."
  In order to focus its strengths on curriculum development, Jostens Learning
  has decided to stop providing hardware and maintenance and to select vendors
  to provide this for Jostens Learning. Jostens Learning does not expect to be
  able to fully recover the costs of its hardware inventory, and a reserve has
  been established for the estimated nonrecoverable amounts.
  
4. Work-Force Reduction: Jostens Learning is reducing complexity, as described
  above, by eliminating diverse businesses, adopting a single management
  system and supporting a simplified product offering. In addition, it is
  redesigning the in-field service provided to customers, and reducing the
  amount of product being developed, therefore, requiring less personnel. This
  will result in severance and relocation costs.
  
The formal plan covering all areas of restructuring will result in termination
of approximately 500 employees, identified by job classification and location.
Affected employees were notified of the general terms of the plan in early
July 1994. Approximately one-half of the individuals affected were notified
and terminated immediately, and all affected employees are expected to be
terminated by the end of April 1995.

The company is currently implementing the Jostens Learning restructuring plan.
With respect to product development, Jostens Learning has ceased all
development work on its proprietary InterActive Media system. In addition, it
has adopted a single management system strategy and has begun converting
customers to a single system.

Shortly after the end of fiscal 1994, Jostens Learning sold its adult division
to Centec Corp. and sold its minority investment in Optical Data Corp. to Cox
Communications. Jostens Learning's efforts to exit the hardware sales and
service business and reduce the work force are progressing.

Approximately $16.5 million ($9.9 million net of tax) of the charge to
earnings related to the Jostens Learning restructuring plan reflects cash to
be expended; the remainder represents asset write-offs and accruals for
business dispositions. Of the cash expenses, net of tax, the
company expects approximately $8.7 million to occur in fiscal 1995 and $1.2
million in fiscal 1996, all of which will be internally funded. The Jostens
Learning restructuring is expected to reduce annual revenues and operating
costs, with a net benefit of between $10 million and $15 million pre-tax after
full implementation, primarily from reductions in amortization and headcount.
The company expects Jostens Learning to improve from last year, but still
operate at a loss in fiscal 1995 and return to profitability in fiscal 1996.

The company has lease commitments on facilities that will be abandoned in 1995
due to the headcount reductions at Jostens Learning.
The company estimates that the net cost of the commitment for these leases is
between $4 million and $6 million after subletting, and will be accrued for
when the facilities are vacated. The leases have lives varying from over one
year to seven years. (See note on Commitments and Contingencies.)

Corporate: In fiscal 1994, Jostens hired Deloitte & Touche to conduct a study
of the company's corporate overhead costs. Deloitte & Touche was requested to
recommend how to reengineer the corporate staff functions to improve
efficiency and effectiveness. The study, completed in the third quarter of
fiscal 1994, recommended changing the management organization. To achieve the
goals identified in the study, the company determined that approximately 150
positions needed to be eliminated. A formal plan identifying the number of
people, functions and locations was developed and approved by the Board of
Directors in the fourth quarter of 1994. Jostens initiated a work-force
reduction effort consisting of a voluntary program followed by an involuntary
reduction in force. The voluntary program concluded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1994, with most of the terminations taking place by June 30, 1994. The
success of the voluntary program resulted in a majority of the targeted
reductions occurring in fiscal 1994 and some involuntary terminations in the
first quarter of fiscal 1995.

Jostens recognized a restructuring charge of $8.5 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1994 to account for this event. Most of the $5.1 million
(net of tax) cash outlay for this restructuring will occur in fiscal 1995 and
will be funded internally. This restructuring is expected to reduce annual
operating costs by $4 million to $6 million.

Fiscal 1993

The restructuring charge taken in 1993 for continuing operations totaled $50.6
million ($33.6 million after tax, 74 cents per share). It included $26.7
million for restructuring the U.S. Photography business, of which $7.9 million
relates to goodwill write-offs ($5.6 million relating to the Portrait World
acquisition in 1989 and $2.3 million relating to various smaller photography
intangibles), $12.8 million relates to plant shutdowns, and $6 million relates
primarily to write-offs of abandoned receivables from independent sales
representatives and dealers. The remaining $23.9 million of restructuring
charges includes $10.2 million primarily for headcount reductions and
relocation expenses; $5 million to write off certain software development
costs at Jostens Learning; and $8.7 million primarily for sales force
restructuring and policy changes, including write-offs of abandoned
receivables from terminated independent sales representatives. The accounts
receivable balances, which would have ordinarily been collectible in the
absence of the changes in the sales force, were abandoned as part of the
territory consolidations and sales force terminations included in the sales
force restructuring.

The restructuring accrual for fiscal 1993 decreased by $26.5 million from June
30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, due to the third-quarter disposition of the
Sportswear business (see Discontinued Operations) and to payments totaling
$11.5 million made in fiscal 1994. Two photography plants that were part of
the 1993 restructuring were closed in April and June of 1994. The remaining
restructuring accrual at June 30, 1994, is $11.6 million. The net-of-tax
outlay is estimated to be paid for with internally generated funds in
subsequent periods as follows: fiscal 1995, $4.8 million; fiscal 1996, $1.7
million; fiscal 1997 and beyond, $500,000.
It is estimated that the 1993 restructuring reduced annual operating costs by
$3 million to $6 million.


DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In January 1994, Jostens sold its Sportswear business to a subsidiary of Fruit
of the Loom for $46.7 million in cash. Jostens recognized an $18.5 million
gain ($11 million after tax) on the sale, primarily because the Sportswear
business had been written down by $15 million to its estimated net realizable
value in the fiscal 1993 restructuring. The
sale's future impact on continuing operations and cash flow is expected to be
immaterial.

CHANGES IN ESTIMATES

In fiscal 1993, Jostens undertook a major restructuring primarily directed at
its School Products businesses. For the first time, a significant reduction
(20 percent) of its independent sales force in the Jewelry and Graduation
Products businesses, along with a major realignment of the sales territories,
occurred. This restructuring marked a substantial change in business
conditions. It was no longer possible to grow by adding more sales
representatives without also redefining and realigning territories. Increasing
school consolidations caused overlaps between sales representatives, thus
increasing the costs of managing territories, and more time was required in
the sales process for each school by the sales representatives. As a result of
these changes in its business conditions, the company recorded additional
provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 for obsolete inventory,
accounts receivable and independent sales force overdrafts of $1 million, $1
million and $5.5 million, respectively. The revised estimates reduced pre-tax
income for fiscal 1993 by $7.5 million (4.6 million after tax,10 cents per
share).

In light of the ongoing ramifications of the fiscal 1993 restructuring, the
separate fiscal 1994 review of Jostens Learning and changes in management and
business practices, the company conducted an intensive review of its accounts
and accounting practices. As a result of the review, which concluded at the
end of the third quarter of fiscal 1994, Jostens increased reserves for
inventories by $3.2 million, receivables by $7.7 million and overdrafts by $6
million to reflect amounts estimated not to be recoverable, based upon current
facts and circumstances. The revised estimates reduced pre-tax income for
fiscal 1994 by $16.9 million ($10.1 million after tax, 22 cents per share).

The changes in estimates are described more fully below:

  Inventory: The company has historically monitored inventory and written off
  obsolete inventory as identified, at least annually. Business volume growth
  remained below original plan in fiscal 1994, causing a build-up of dated
  and/or excessive inventories. Accordingly, the company conducted a business-by
  -business and individual product line review of its inventory. The company re-
  evaluated the adequacy of its reserves for obsolete inventories and, employing
  a more systematic methodology based on recent experience, determined that an
  additional charge for specifically identified obsolete
  inventory should be recorded, and a reserve should be established to reflect
  current business conditions. The charge to earnings in the third quarter for
  this was $3.2 million.
  
  Accounts Receivable: Similar to inventory, management has revised its
  estimates for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon its intensive
  review. In particular, one account for which reserves had been increased
  substantially in 1993 continued to deteriorate and resulted in a contract
  termination and a new contract in late 1994 to facilitate cash collections
  on accounts receivable. Specific reserves for the estimated uncollectability
  of this account receivable were increased $3.3 million. The company also
  increased specific reserves for other accounts deemed to be not fully
  recoverable. As a result of the review, an additional charge of $4.4 million
  was recorded.
  
  Overdrafts: The company provides its independent sales representatives with
  cash draws throughout the year which are netted against their annual earned
  commissions. It is not unusual for new sales representa tives or those in
  new territories to earn less commissions than the established draws for a
  period of several years, creating an "overdraft" situation. Such overdrafts
  are then reduced in subsequent years through earned commissions.
  
  At the end of fiscal 1993, a restructuring of the sales force occurred which
  realigned territories and eliminated about 20 percent of the sales force.
  Overdrafts of $3.2 million applicable to this group thus became
  uncollectible and were accordingly classified with the fourth-quarter 1993
  restructuring. Also, at the end of fiscal 1993, all cash advances to
  continuing sales representatives were examined for collectability, taking
  into consideration the newly realigned territories and the sales costs
  experienced by sales representatives. The company recorded in the fourth
  quarter of 1993 an additional charge of $5.5 million.
  
  In the third quarter of fiscal 1994, based upon the continuing assessment
  of the results of the restructuring in light of the new business
  environment, the company determined that a change in estimate was
  appropriate to reflect both specifically identified additional over drafts
  that are estimated to be unrecoverable as well as the establish ment of
  general reserves to reflect recent experience. An additional charge of $6
  million was recorded.
  
  
RESTATEMENT

After its fiscal 1993 restructuring, Jostens began centralizing and stan
dardizing business practices, and management reviewed the company's ac
counting policies and procedures to (1) ensure that they appropriately
reflected the way the company was conducting its business in the wake of the
fiscal 1993 restructuring, and (2) to determine whether previously identified
audit differences, which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate in
prior periods, cumulatively had become more significant given the changes in
shareholders' investment.

During the first three quarters of fiscal 1994, Jostens conducted this review
and consulted with Ernst & Young, its independent auditors. The company
determined that the impact on shareholders' investment of the 1993 and 1994
restructurings, as well as the changes in business practices (combined with
the company's desire to conform its basic policies to generally accepted
accounting principles regardless of the immateriality of these previously
identified differences), necessitated the restatement. (See note on
Restatement.)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Stockholders of Jostens Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jostens Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' investment and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Jostens Inc. and
subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of their

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Jostens Inc. and Subsidiaries




SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows. For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and
short-term investments include cash on hand, time deposits and commercial
paper.  Short-term investments have an original maturity of three months or 
less. Total cash payments for income taxes and interest were $8.9 million, 
$24.2 million, and $33.4 million, and $5.9 million, $7.5 million, and $8.5 
million respectively, for 1994, 1993 and 1992.

SFAS No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, must be adopted no later than fiscal 1995. The implementation of
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the results of
operations. Marketable securities, which consist of commercial paper, are
recorded at cost that approximates market.

Inventories. Gold and certain other inventories aggregating $4.1 million at
June 30, 1994, and $2.2 million at June 30, 1993, are stated at the lower of
last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market, and are $13.8 million and $13.1
million lower in the respective years than such inventories deter mined under
the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. All other inventories
are stated at the lower of FIFO cost or market.

Inventory Obsolescence. The company's policy is to employ a systematic
methodology that includes quarterly evaluations of inventory, based upon
business trends, to specifically identify obsolete, slow-moving and
nonsalable inventory. Inventory reserves are evaluated quarterly to ensure
they continually reflect current business environment and trends.

Intangibles. Intangibles primarily represent the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the net tangible assets of acquired businesses.
Intangibles are being amortized over various periods of up to 40 years. The
company recognized an intangible asset relating to additional minimum pension
liability of $5.5 million in 1994. Accumulated amortization at June 30, 1994
and 1993, was $23.2 million and $21.7 million, respectively. The carrying
value of intangible assets is assessed annually and/or when factors
indicating an impairment are present. The company employs an undiscounted
cash flow method of assessment for these assets.

Software Development Costs. Jostens Learning capitalizes software development
costs when the project reaches technological feasibility and ceases
capitalization when the product is ready for release. Research and
development costs related to software
development that has not reached technological feasibility are expensed as
incurred. Software development costs are amortized on the straight-line
method over a maximum of five years or the expected life of the product,
whichever is less. Amortization of capitalized software costs for June 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992, was $15.5 million, $10.9 million and $6 million,
respectively. Accumulated amortization at June 30, 1994 and 1993, was $35
million and $30.9 million, respectively. Research and development expense
charged to operations was $12.9 million, $17.6 million and $13.2 million in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The company performs a net realizability
evaluation of its software products. The company recognized a $1.9 million
write-off of software in 1994 as a result of the evaluation, in addition to
$25.3 million and $5 million written off in the restructurings of fiscal 1994
and 1993, respectively. No write-offs were recognized in 1993 or 1992 due to
impairment of net realizable value.

Depreciation. Depreciation on buildings, machinery and
equipment is provided principally on the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes over their estimated useful lives: buildings, 15 to 40
years; machinery and equipment, three to 10 years. Depreciation expense
charged to operations was $19.2 million, $20.4 million and $20.2 million in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Income Taxes. Effective in fiscal 1993, the company adopted SFAS No.109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, by restating prior years. This statement
requires a change from the deferred method of accounting for income taxes to
the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
approach, deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately
payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates
are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.

Revenue Recognition. Jostens Learning recognizes revenue for hardware and
software upon shipment of the product, provided that no significant vendor or
post-contractor obligations remain outstanding and collection of the
resulting receivable is deemed probable. Revenue generated from service
contracts and post-contract customer support on software is recognized
ratably over the period of the contract. The revenue recognition for
instruction and user training is part of the service contract recognized
ratably over the life of the contract. For insignificant vendor and post
contract obligations remaining at the time of shipment, the company's policy
is to accrue all such obligations. Deferred revenue comprises payments
received in advance of revenue recognized on contracts. For all other Jostens
businesses, revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product.

Sales Returns and Warranty Costs. Provisions for sales returns and warranty
costs are recorded at the time of sale based on historical information
adjusted for current trends.

Translation of Foreign Currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated at
the current exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. Translation
adjustments are recorded as a separate component of equity.

Earnings Per Common Share. Earnings per share have been computed by dividing
net income by the average number of common shares outstanding. The impact of
any additional shares issuable upon the exercise of dilutive stock options is
not material.

Postemployment Benefits. SFAS No.112, Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits, must be adopted no later than fiscal 1995. Adopting
this statement is expected to result in a $1.1 million charge to operations
in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.

Reclassification. Certain 1993 and 1992 balances have been reclassified to
conform to the 1994 presentation.


RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Fiscal 1994

The company recorded a restructuring charge of $69.4 million ($45.3 million
after tax, $1 per share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, including
charges of $60.9 million for Jostens Learning and $8.5 million for reduced 
headcount in the company's general and administrative functions.

The restructuring charge relating to Jostens Learning includes $39.1 million
to focus its product development. This involves abandoning certain
capitalized software and proprietary management systems. The remaining
restructuring charge relating to Jostens Learning includes $7.3 million to
exit both direct and indirect investments in three ancillary lines of
business, $4.1 million to exit the hardware sales and
service business, and $10.4 million for work force reduction.

Total fiscal 1994 restructuring charges included $40.7 million of asset write-
offs and $28.7 million of accruals, of which $28.2 million remain at June 30,
1994. The accruals are classified as follows: $13.7 million classified in
other liabilities, including $3.7 million relating to
business dispositions, $200,000 in accounts payable and $14.3 million in
salaries, wages and commissions.

Fiscal 1993

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the company recorded a $50.6 million
($33.6 million after tax, 74 cents per share) restructuring charge for
continuing operations. The charge included $26.7 million for restructuring
the U.S. Photography business, of which $7.9 million related to goodwill
write-offs ($5.6 million relating to the Portrait World acquisition in 1989
and $2.3 million in various smaller photography intangibles), $12.8 million
related to plant shutdowns and $6 million related primarily to write-offs of
abandoned receivables from independent sales representatives and dealers. The
remaining $23.9 million of restructuring charges included $10.2 million
primarily for headcount reductions and relocation expenses; $5 million for
the write-off of certain software development costs at Jostens Learning; and
$8.7 million primarily for sales force restructuring and policy changes,
including write-offs of abandoned receivables from terminated independent
sales representatives. The accounts receivable balances, which would have
ordinarily been collectible in the absence of the changes in the sales force,
were abandoned as part of the territory consolidations and sales force
terminations resulting from the sales force restructuring.

Prior to reclassification, the 1993 restructuring also included $15 million
to write down the carrying value of the Sportswear business to its net
realizable value. The $15 million related to the sale of Sportswear in 1994
was reclassified as part of a discontinued operation. (See note on
Discontinued Operations.)

The restructuring charges taken in fiscal 1993 have a remaining accrual of
$11.6 million as of June 30, 1994, relating to plant shutdown costs and long-
term leases. Cash payments made on the accruals in fiscal 1994 were
approximately $11.5 million.


DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In January 1994, Jostens sold its Sportswear business to a subsidiary of
Fruit of the Loom for $46.7 million in cash. Jostens recognized an $18.5
million gain ($11 million after
tax) on the sale, primarily because the Sportswear business had been written
down by $15 million to its estimated net realizable value in the fiscal 1993
restructuring. Revenues and income tax benefits related to the Sportswear
business were $52.1 million, $82.8 million and $68.5 million, and $500,000,
$4.9 million and $800,000, respectively, for 1994, 1993 and 1992. Prior-year
amounts have been reclassified to present Sportswear as a discontinued
operation.


CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

As a result of a review that concluded at the end of the third quarter of
fiscal 1994, the company increased reserves for inventories, receivables and
overdrafts from independent sales representatives to reflect amounts
estimated not to be recoverable, based upon current facts and circumstances.
The revised estimates reduced pre-tax income for fiscal 1994 by $16.9 million
($10.1 million after tax, 22 cents per share).


RESTATEMENT

The financial statements for the last five fiscal years have been restated
because the company has revised the accounting treatment of several items to
more fully conform its accounting policies and practices to generally
accepted accounting principles. The restatement increased shareholders'
investment at June 30, 1993, by $2.4 million. Income from continuing
operations after income taxes and net income were reduced by $600,000 (1 cent
per share) and $2.8 million (6 cents per share) for the years ended June 30,
1993 and 1992, respectively. Amounts reflected in the restated June 30, 1993,
balance sheet include: (1) establishing reserves for vacation pay, sales
returns and allowances, and a supplemental executive retirement plan
aggregating $20.7 million; (2) reducing the fiscal 1993 restructuring charge
by $5 million to reinstate goodwill that was incorrectly deemed to be
impaired; (3) increasing capital surplus by $2.4 million for stock
appreciation rights canceled in prior years, previously classified as a
liability; (4) increasing capital surplus by $10.7 million for tax benefits
from prior years' disqualifying disposition of stock options, previously
recorded as a tax liability (including $7.5 million that had been
reclassified in fiscal 1993 from tax liability to reserves for overdrafts,
receivables and inventories); and (5) recording $2.7 million in additional
tax benefits from operating loss carryforwards. The company had not
previously made these accounting adjustments because they were immaterial
individually and in the aggregate to its financial position and results of
operations in the previous years to which they relate.

ACQUISITIONS

In August 1992, Jostens acquired Wicat Systems Inc., a provider of technology-
based learning systems for the education and aviation markets. The
transaction was effected through the exchange of approximately 4.1 million
common shares of the company for all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Wicat. The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests;
accordingly, all financial data for periods prior to the merger have been
restated to include the results of Wicat.

   Net sales, net income and earnings per share for the 1992
   fiscal year preceding the merger were as follows:

Annual maturities on long-term debt are $400,000 in 1996,
$50 million in 1997, zero in 1998, zero in 1999 and $3.9
million thereafter.

During fiscal 1994, Jostens had unsecured lines of credit with four banks
totaling $110 million, under which the company could either borrow on a
short-term basis or use the bank's credit to support the issuance of short-term
commercial paper. In addition, the company had unsecured demand facilities with
two banks totalling $55 million. Such credit arrangements are renegotiated
periodically based on the anticipated seasonal needs for short-term financing.
In compensation for its credit arrangements, the company incurred certain 
commitment fees, which were not significant.


INCOME TAXES

Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes, discontinued operations
and change in accounting principle was as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant
components of the deferred income tax liabilities and assets as of June 30,
1994 and 1993, were as follows:

At June 30, 1994, the company has net operating loss carryforwards from
business acquisitions of $25.2 million for federal income tax purposes that
expire in the years 1998 through 2004. The company also has investment tax
credit and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of $1.5
million that expire in the years 1998 through 2004.

BENEFIT PLANS

The company's noncontributory pension plans cover substantially all
employees. The defined benefits provided under the plans are based on years
of service and/or compensation levels. Annually, the company funds the
actuarially determined costs of these plans, including the amortization of
prior service costs over 30 years.

Service cost represents the present value of the increase in future benefits
resulting from the current year's service. The projected benefit obligation
is the present value of benefits, assuming future compensation levels, for
services rendered to date.

During 1994, the company recorded an adjustment of $8.8 million to recognize
the minimum pension liability required by the SFAS No.87, Employers'
Accounting for Pensions. The adjustment, which had no effect on 1994 income,
was offset by recording an intangible asset in the amount of $5.5 million and
a reduction in shareholders' investment of $2 million after tax, as required
by SFAS No.87.

In 1986, the company established a supplemental executive retirement plan
funded by life insurance on the plan participants. While the plan is designed
to be self-funding, based upon the life insurance proceeds purchased on
behalf of the plan participants, this plan meets the guidelines of SFAS
No.87, resulting in a liability of $8.4 million and $8 million as of June 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively.
The components of pension cost and the funded status were as follows:

In conjunction with the divestiture of Sportswear, accrued  benefits under
the applicable defined-benefit pension plans were frozen and active
participants became fully vested. The plans' trustee will continue to
maintain and invest plan assets and will administer benefit payments. In
accordance with SFAS No.88, Employers' Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans, a loss of $700,000 was
included in the gain on disposal of Sportswear.

The company's retirement savings plan, which covers substantially all
nonunion employees, provides for a matching contribution by the company on
amounts, limited to 6 percent of compensation, contributed by employees. The
company's contribution for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, was
$2.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, representing 50
percent of eligible employee contributions in 1994, 33.3 percent in 1993 and
25 percent in 1992.


POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

Jostens provides medical insurance benefits for substantially all retirees.
Employees who retired prior to June 30, 1992, pay medical contributions at an
amount either frozen at retirement or at a fixed percentage of the plan costs
prior to age 65. Employees retiring after that date receive only a fixed
dollar contribution toward coverage prior to age 65. The fixed dollar
contribution is based on vested service at retirement and is not projected to
increase in the future.

In fiscal 1993, Jostens adopted SFAS No.106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. This statement requires the
accrual of postretirement benefit costs during the years an employee provides
services. The unfunded obligation of $6.7 million ($4.2 million after tax)
was charged against earnings, effective as of the beginning of the year. The
cost of these benefits in fiscal 1992 was $600,000, which was recognized as a
charge to income in the year the benefits were paid. The costs of these
benefits under SFAS No.106 were as follows:

The actuarial present value of postretirement benefit
obligations and the amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets as of
June 30, 1994 and 1993, were as follows:

The assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation
in fiscal 1994 included a medical plan cost trend rate of 14.5 percent,
declining to 7.9 percent in the year 2000, and a weighted average discount
rate of 7.5 percent. Fiscal 1993 assumptions included a medical plan cost trend
rate of 15 percent, declining to 6 percent in the year 2002, and a weighted 
average discount rate of 8 percent. A one-percentage-point increase in the
assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year increases the 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for health care benefits by 
approximately $500,000 with minimal impact on interest cost and no impact on
service cost, since benefits for future retirees are defined dollar benefits
unrelated to health care benefits.


COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The company's noncancelable minimum rental commitments for facilities and
equipment are $9.6 million in fiscal 1995, $7.1 million in 1996, $ 6.1 million
in 1997, $3.1 million in 1998, $2.4 million in 1999 and $6.6 million thereafter.
Operating lease rental expenses were $11.7 million in 1994, $10.7 million in
1993 and $10 million in 1992.

Jostens has forward contracts of $25.7 million for commitments to purchase
65,000 ounces of gold that mature at various times in fiscal 1995 with prices
ranging from $368 to $402 per ounce.

Jostens is a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business.
Management regularly analyzes current information and, as necessary, provides
accruals for probable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters.
Management believes that the effect on the company's results of operations and
financial position, if any, for the disposition of these matters will not be
material.


STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

Under stock option plans, Jostens has granted options to key employees to
purchase common shares of the company at 100 percent of the market price on the
dates the options are granted. The following summarizes the changes in stock
options outstanding:
                                       Options Outstanding

End of Year                          2,400   2,446    2,181

At June 30, 1994, the exercise price on outstanding options ranged from $1.21 to
$34.19 per share, and approximately 1.1 million common shares were reserved for
future grants under the stock option plans. As of June 30, 1994, 1.4 million
options were exercisable under stock option plans.

Jostens Learning, under its stock option plan, may grant options to key
employees to purchase common shares of Jostens Learning at the fair market value
on the date the options are granted. Options to purchase up to 21.2 million
shares, or approximately 15 percent of the total outstanding shares, may be
granted under the plan. Options vest at 20 percent per year commencing one year
from the date of grant. The shares acquired upon exercise of the options may be
put to or called by Jostens Learning at the then-current fair market value,
after a specified holding period. Option shares may first be put or called in
1995. The company may elect to purchase the Jostens Learning shares for cash or
Jostens common shares. As of June 30, 1994, options for 9.7 million shares were
outstanding at exercise prices ranging from $1.15 to $3.21 per share, of which
3.2 million shares were exercisable. The fair value of the stock at June 30,
1994, was below the lowest exercise price.

Jostens maintains a stock incentive plan, which includes the grant of
restricted stock awards. The plan was approved by shareholders Oct. 22, 1992.
Shares of restricted stock issued under the plan are subject to transfer
restrictions based on the continuous employment of the employee, other than
retirement, and/or performance criteria. Participants have voting, liquidation
and other rights with respect to shares of common stock issued to the
participant as a restricted stock award. Restricted stock awards based solely on
continuous employment of the employee granted and outstanding as of June 30,
1994, totaled 4,500 shares. Holders of these restricted stock awards receive
dividends paid on the common stock. Restricted stock awards based on the
achievement of established goals granted and outstanding as of June 30, 1994,
totaled 30,000 shares. Holders of these restricted stock awards do not receive
dividends paid on the common stock.


SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

In August 1988, the Board of Directors declared a distribution to shareholders
of one common share purchase right for each outstanding common share. Each right
entitles the holder to purchase one common share at an exercise price of $60.
The rights become exercisable if a person acquires 20 percent or more, or
announces a tender offer for 25 percent or more, of the company's common shares.
If a person acquires at least 25 percent of the company's outstanding shares,
each right will entitle the holder to purchase the company's common shares
having a market value of twice the exercise price of the right. If the company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination, each right will entitle
the holder to purchase common stock of the acquiring company at a similar 50
percent discount. The rights, which expire in August 1998, may be redeemed by
the company at a price of 1 cent per right at any time prior to the 30th day
after a person has acquired at least 20 percent of the company's outstanding
shares.
