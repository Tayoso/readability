Item 1.   Business

GENERAL

      Western Waste Industries (the Company) is the successor to a
sole proprietorship that commenced the business of waste collection
and disposal in 1955.   The Company was incorporated in California
in January 1964 as Western Refuse Hauling, Inc.  The name later
became WRH Industries and then Western Waste Industries. 
     
      Western Waste Industries is a provider of integrated waste
services to commercial, industrial and residential customers. 
These services consist of the collection, transfer and disposal of
solid waste in certain areas of California, Texas, Louisiana,
Florida, Colorado and Arkansas.  The Company has approximately 90
franchise agreements, 82 of which designate the Company as the
exclusive provider of certain waste services within a particular
municipality or county.  As part of its business, the Company
operates six landfills, three transfer stations and four recycling
facilities.  The Company does not operate hazardous waste landfills
and limits its hazardous waste activities to the transportation of
such materials for others which accounted for approximately 1% of
the Company's revenue during fiscal 1994.

     The Company has a diversified customer base with no single
customer accounting for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in
any one of its last three fiscal years.  During fiscal 1992, 1993
and 1994, operations in California accounted for approximately 65%,
64% and 68%, respectively, of revenue.  


                                                   Contribution to Revenue 
                                                      Year Ended June 30,

COLLECTION SERVICES
     
     Contracts.  Substantially all of the Company's residential,
and a certain portion of its commercial and industrial collection
services are performed under approximately 90 municipal and
<PAGE>
regional authority contracts.  These contracts presently represent
approximately 46% of the Company's revenue.  A contract is an
agreement awarded by a municipality or regional authority to
provide collection and/or recycling services to commercial and
industrial or residential customers in the jurisdiction.  

     These contracts are normally awarded following competitive
bidding, usually have terms of five or more years, and contain
renewal options.  Payment for residential services is generally
received directly from the municipality or authority.  Such
contracts provide for rate adjustments including, but not limited
to, increases in the consumer price index and disposal cost
increases.
     
     Most of the remaining collection revenues are provided under
one to three year service agreements. 

     The Company anticipates that more municipalities, in an effort
to reduce costs and capital expenditures related to waste services
and to deal with their budgetary fiscal constraints, will contract
for such services with private sector companies.  Such action by
municipalities will continue to provide an incremental source of
revenue for the Company.  

     Commercial and Industrial.   The Company provides collection
services to more than 63,000 commercial and industrial customer
locations, which accounted for approximately 57% of total fiscal
1994 revenue.  Commercial and industrial collection services are
generally performed under agreements, and fees are determined by
such factors as collection frequency, type of equipment and
containers furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste
collected and the distance to the disposal site.  A portion of
commercial and industrial services are performed under municipal
and regional authority contracts.

     The Company's commercial and industrial customers utilize
containers that range from one to 45 cubic yards in size.  The use
of containers enables the Company to service most of its commercial
and industrial customers with collection vehicles operated by a
single employee.  Stationary compactors, which reduce the volume of
the stored waste prior to collection, are frequently installed by
the Company on the premises of large volume customers.  

     The Company has interstate industrial transportation
operations servicing primarily customers for the Company's Texas
and Arkansas industrial non-hazardous disposal sites.  The Company
currently holds authority to transport waste in 21 states, mostly
in the southern portion of the United States.  The Company believes
that further development of its industrial transportation
capabilities in close coordination with its disposal sites will
strengthen its ability to provide fully integrated industrial waste
handling services.
<PAGE>
     Residential.  During fiscal 1994, approximately 28% of total
revenue was derived from the curbside collection and transportation
of residential refuse to a landfill or transfer station.  The
Company serviced approximately 677,000 homes and other residential
dwelling units.  Substantially all of the services for homes and
other residential units are performed under exclusive franchise
agreements granted by municipalities or regional authorities.  Fees
are based primarily on market factors, frequency and type of
service, distance to processing or disposal facilities and cost of
processing or disposal.  Residential collection fees are normally
paid by the municipalities out of tax revenues or service charges
or, in a limited amount of cases, are paid directly by the
residents receiving the service.    

     Hazardous Waste.  Hazardous waste hauling activities, included
in commercial and industrial services, accounted for approximately
1% of total revenue during fiscal 1994.  The Company does not
operate any hazardous waste landfills.  Its hazardous waste
activities are limited to the transportation of non-liquid
materials in drums and other containers provided and packaged by
its customers.  The materials are hauled to licensed hazardous
waste landfills owned and operated by others.  The transporting of
hazardous waste requires state and, for certain hauling, federal
licenses.  Management believes that the Company has all necessary
licenses to carry on its current hazardous waste activities and is
in material compliance with applicable regulations.  The Company
carries separate insurance to cover such activities.


LANDFILLS

     Landfill disposal continues to be a primary depository for
solid waste in North America.  With the enactment of the Resource
Recovery and Conservation Act Subtitle D regulations, the impact on
landfill design, permitting and construction has increased capital
resources required to develop additional disposal capacity.  At the
same time, the Company believes that replacement of existing
disposal capacity with more costly, environmentally secure capacity
will result generally in an increase in the price of waste
disposal.

      The Company operates disposal sites in California, Texas,
Louisiana and Florida.  Six facilities are currently operating. 
Certain of these sites have expansion plans and additional sites
are under development or in construction.   Of the six operating
landfills, four are owned by the Company.  None of the landfills
are permitted to accept hazardous waste, and the Company's policies
and controls are structured to minimize acceptance of such waste. 
Disposal fees received from third parties generated approximately
7% of fiscal 1994 revenue. 

     In Southern California, the Company owns and operates the El
<PAGE>
Sobrante landfill which began receiving waste in July 1986.  Solid
Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds were issued to finance its
development.  The El Sobrante landfill operates under a joint
development agreement with the County of Riverside for an initial
term of 15 years with two successive five year renewal options.  At
the present waste disposal rate, the site has an estimated
remaining life of approximately ten years.  Commencing in September
1992, the Company was allowed to import, on a limited basis, solid
waste collected outside of Riverside County to the El Sobrante
Landfill site.  The amount of out-of-county waste cannot exceed 1.8
million tons.  In March 1994, the Company received a permit to
increase the daily tonnage from 2,000 to 4,000 tons per day.  

     The Company acquired 1,140 acres contiguous to the existing El
Sobrante operating site with the intent of expanding landfill
operations.  The Company has begun the permitting process for this
acreage which, if successful, would add 100 million tons of
disposal capacity to this site.  In April 1991, the Company signed
a preliminary memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the County of
Riverside regarding this acreage.   This MOU included a provision
for up to a 10,000 tons per day operation, and increased the amount
of out-of-county waste which the site may accept.  There is no
assurance that the expansion project will be permitted.

     In Texas, the Company leases and operates a 64-acre disposal
site in Conroe for the City of Conroe.  The lease term is for the
life of the site.  

     Adjacent to the Conroe, Texas leased site, the Company
operates a special waste (non-hazardous industrial) landfill on a
100-acre tract owned by the Company and repermitted by the Texas
Water Commission in April 1992.  The Company began receiving waste
under this permit in August 1992.  Current estimates of the
operating life of the facility is in excess of 25 years.  The
Company acquired an additional 78-acre tract in May 1989 with the
intention of utilizing it for future development.

     In 1990, the Company acquired a 90-acre landfill from the City
of New Boston, Texas, located 25 miles west of Texarkana.  The
permit has been upgraded and the site is currently operating.  The
life of this facility is estimated to exceed four years.  The
Company is in the process of developing and submitting a permit
modification that will double the existing capacity of the
landfill. 

     In Florida, the Company operates a 65-acre site under contract
with the County of Nassau.  The contract had an initial term of two
years through September 1989, and the Company subsequently received
a three year extension of the contract.  In 1991, the Company
negotiated a $14 million contract with the County of Nassau, to
construct and operate an additional 140-acre landfill for an
initial term of five years with a five year extension option. 
<PAGE>
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will close the
existing 65-acre tract and construct a new disposal site.  In 1992,
the Company negotiated a modification to the construction contract
to provide for an expansion of the site airspace capacity.  The
construction project is scheduled for completion in fiscal 1995.

     In Arkansas, the Company owns a 160-acre landfill in
Texarkana.  The site, which stopped receiving waste in May 1993, is
filled to permit capacity and is being closed.  The application for
a permit covering the 40 acre final phase of this site has been
denied and is the subject of an administrative appeal by the
Company. 

     In September 1991, the Company contracted to operate, under a
closure plan approved by the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality, a 320-acre landfill located in Jefferson Parish (near New
Orleans), Louisiana.  The landfill commenced operations in February
1992.  Due to changes in law and other unforeseeable circumstances,
the Company discontinued its operation of the site October 8, 1993.

     In September 1990, the Company acquired a 240-acre waste
disposal facility in Livonia, Louisiana, approximately 22 miles
west of Baton Rouge.  This facility, which is permitted to receive
municipal solid waste and special waste, is currently under
construction with operations expected to commence in fiscal 1995. 
Included in the facility is a waste disposal facility which can
dispose of non-hazardous oilfield waste.

     The Company has the right to acquire a 648-acre site for the
development of a municipal solid waste and special waste landfill
approximately five miles east of Lake Charles, Louisiana.  The
permit application was denied by the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality and is currently the subject of appeal
through a state administrative proceeding.

        The Company has entered into a joint development
arrangement with Gold Fields Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Hanson PLC,  and SP Environmental, a sister subsidiary of the
Southern Pacific Railroad for the purpose of developing a waste-by-
rail project called California InteRail.  The parties are in the
process of permitting a landfill in Imperial County, California,
which has an approximate capacity of 600 million tons.   As part of
this project, existing facilities owned by the Company, SP
Environmental, and others could be utilized and new facilities will
be developed on an as needed basis.  Based upon the current
schedule, the landfill could be in operation as early as 1996.    

     In accordance with the Company's overall plan of corporate
development, other landfill sites are currently being evaluated
both in the Company's existing markets and new markets for joint
collection and disposal investment.  Sites for certain projects
have been selected and preliminary engineering analyses are
<PAGE>
currently underway.  Normally, the permitting process for landfill
sites takes three to five years. 



TRANSFER STATIONS

      The Company owns or operates three transfer stations.  A
transfer station is a facility where solid waste is received from
collection vehicles and then transferred to and compacted in large,
specially constructed trailers for transportation to disposal
facilities.  This procedure reduces costs by improving utilization
of collection personnel and equipment.  The services of these
facilities are provided to municipalities or counties and in most
cases are also used by the Company and other collection companies. 
Fees are generally based upon such considerations as market
factors, the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred,
the extent of recycling, the transport distance involved and the
cost of disposal.

     The Company has a transfer station in Carson, California which
currently processes approximately 2,300 tons per day. 
Approximately 86% of the tonnage delivered to this transfer station
is provided by the Company's collection operations with the
remainder received from municipalities which collect their own
residential refuse and from other refuse haulers.  The Company has
applied for approval to increase the volume of waste processed at
the transfer station to 5,000 tons of solid waste per day.  This
application is pending.  

     In March 1993, the Company was awarded a contract to operate
the Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer Station (SMART).  The
service area for the station is the cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain
View, and Palo Alto, California.  The initial term of the contract
is for seven years with an option to extend by the City for up to
an additional seven years.  The operation began on October 1, 1993. 

     The Company operates a transfer station adjacent to the
Company's Fresno operations.  The transfer station, which includes
a commercial materials recycling building, is designed to receive
up to 2,500 tons per day of solid waste.  The solid waste permit
currently allows up to 1,000 tons per day with a green waste
storage area.  


RECYCLING/WASTE DIVERSION

     The Company operates four recycling facilities in California,
one each in Redondo Beach, Chino, Carson, and San Jose.  Recycling
involves the removal of reusable materials from the waste stream
for processing and sale for use in various applications.  The
Company is assisting certain communities, with which it has
<PAGE>
municipal contracts, in implementing recycling programs, and has
entered into long-term recycling agreements with several
communities in the Company's markets.  The Company is also involved
in receiving, processing, composting and end-market distribution of
green and wood waste material in California and Texas. 

OTHER ACTIVITIES

     Western Waste is involved in certain other business
activities, relating to waste services, including construction
support, earth-moving, excavation contracting, and engineering and
consulting services.  In addition, in fiscal 1992, 1993 and 1994,
the Company was involved in the construction of a new landfill for
Nassau County, Florida.  


REGULATION

     The Company is currently subject to extensive and evolving
federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws and
regulations.  These regulations are administered by the
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and various other federal,
state and local agencies.

      Collection Services: In the solid waste collection phase,
regulation takes such forms as licensing of collection vehicles,
vehicle safety requirements, vehicle weight limitation and, in
certain localities, limitations on rates, area, time, frequency of
collection and transportation of waste to disposal sites.  Zoning
and land use restrictions are encountered in the solid waste
transfer, resource recovery and disposal phases of the Company's
business.  Air quality and noise pollution regulations may also
affect the Company's operations.  Governmental authorities have the
power to enforce compliance, and violators are subject to
injunctions or fines, or both.  Private individuals may also have
the right to sue to enforce compliance.  Safety standards under the
Occupational Safety and Health Act are also applicable.

     Landfills:  In 1980 the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund" or "CERCLA") was
issued.  CERCLA addresses problems created by the release of
hazardous substances into the environment.  CERCLA imposes strict,
joint and several liability on the present or former operators of
facilities which release hazardous substances into the environment. 
Waste generators and transporters are also strictly liable.  It is
possible that the EPA or others could contend that at least some
amounts of hazardous substances exist in the Company's operating
and closed disposal facilities.  If these sites ever experience
environmental problems, there can be no assurance that the Company
will not face claims resulting in liability.  

     In 1991, the EPA issued revisions to Subtitle D of the
<PAGE>
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA") which
regulates the handling, transportation and disposal of waste and
requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of
waste.  These revisions affected comprehensive solid waste
management regulations, including location standards, facility
design and operating criteria, closure and post-closure
requirements, financial assurance standards, and groundwater
monitoring and corrective action standards which were not
previously in place or enforced at landfills.  The Company believes
that all Company landfills meet or exceed compliance with these
regulations.  In addition, the Company's planned landfill
expansions will be engineered to meet or exceed these requirements.

     The Company has periodically undertaken, and may in the future
undertake or be required to implement and/or adhere to environmental 
guidelines at existing facilities, and to add additional monitoring 
post-closure maintenance or corrective measures at closed waste disposal 
sites. The Company cannot predict the financial impact, if any, of such 
matters on the Company's operations.
  
     During the ordinary course of its landfill operations, the
Company is, as are others in the industry, subject to governmental
enforcement proceedings and resulting fines or other sanctions from
such authorities regarding full compliance with applicable
environmental or health or safety regulations.  The Company
believes that based on the results of management's review of its
operations, that it has taken appropriate charges and that expense
accruals have been provided by the Company for its share of any of
these potential liabilities.  

     Transportation Services: The Company's transportation of
hazardous waste consists of the hauling of solid material in either
individual sealed containers or in specially designed, and licensed
bins.  The State of California licenses the bins and trailers and
the tractors are subject to the Southern California Air Quality
Management District's regulations in regard to local enforcement of
the Clean Air Act.  The Clean Air Act provides for the federal,
state, and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants.  The
Company's transporting operation has not been subject to any
requirement of the Clean Air Act other than the required posting by
the Southern California Air Quality Management District in regard
to smog alert requirements, which is in effect for all of the
Company's fleet and most other companies in the same geographical
area. 

      The Company also engages in the interstate transportation of 
hazardous and industrial non-hazardous waste.  The Company has all
of the proper permits to operate in these states.

     Summary: The Company believes that it is currently in
substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local
<PAGE>
laws, permits, orders, and regulations.  The Company believes that
there will probably be increased regulation and legislation related
to the waste management industry in the future.  The Company
attempts to anticipate future regulatory, political and legal
developments that might affect its operations and plans accordingly
to remain in compliance with the regulatory framework.  The Company
cannot predict the extent to which any legislation or regulation
that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect its
operations particularly in the event that regulations are applied
retroactively.  


CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT

     The Company's corporate development program emphasizes the
development of a broad range of waste services.  These services
include collection, recycling, processing, composting, transfer and
disposal.  This range enables the Company to compete for business
and expand current customer relationships.

     Management envisions that this program will result in the
expansion of its landfill operations, further penetration of its
existing collection markets, and acquisitions which either
complement its existing operations or allow it to expand into new
geographic markets.

     Waste reduction legislation in California, Florida and
Louisiana, and contemplated in other states in which the Company
operates, is causing municipalities to rethink their waste
programs.  The Company views recycling and other municipal waste
service reduction programs as the catalyst which will enable the
Company to expand its services to communities and customers it
currently does not serve and further cement relationships with
current customers.

     Management believes that as local governmental budgets face
fiscal constraints, an increasing number of municipalities will
turn to private sector companies to meet their waste disposal
demands.  The Company, in an effort to expand its customer base,
has therefore focused a significant amount of its marketing efforts
on obtaining additional municipal franchises to supplement its
existing, approximately 90, franchises.  

     The Company's acquisition activity has been focused on
collection companies either within or located near current Western
Waste operations.  The Company has also acquired companies to
expand into new markets.  Over the past three years, the Company
purchased the routes and certain assets of eleven companies,
including one in fiscal 1994.  The Company plans to increase
acquisition activity in fiscal 1995.
<PAGE>
BONDING AND INSURANCE

     In order to submit a bid or proposal to a governmental or
corporate entity to provide collection, hauling and disposal
services, the Company is often required to submit simultaneously a
bid bond or a letter of credit and, upon contract award, provide a
bond or letter of credit to secure its performance of the contract. 
Management believes that its current bonding coverage and borrowing
capacity are adequate for its present needs.

     The Company has a risk management program whereby it retains
the liability, subject to maximum limits, for auto, general
liability, employee health and welfare benefits and workers'
compensation.   The Company carries insurance coverage which
management considers sufficient to protect the assets and
operations of the Company, including excess umbrella and special
hazardous waste transportation coverage.

     Management believes the self insured loss reserves of the
Company are adequate.  The Company establishes reserves to cover
its estimated liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment
expenses related to claims reported before the balance sheet date,
claims incurred but not yet reported, and the expenses of
investigating and adjusting all claims incurred prior to the
balance sheet date.  All estimated liabilities are net of estimated
salvage and subrogation recoveries and net of insurance coverage
above self insurance retention levels.

     The Company establishes self insured  loss reserves based on
estimates of the ultimate cost of claims (including loss adjustment
expenses) which have been reported but not fully paid, and of
claims which have been incurred but not yet reported.  The length
of time for which such costs must be estimated varies depending on
the coverage involved.  Actual claim costs are dependent upon such
complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrine of legal
liability and size of damage awards.  Because of the variables
involved, the reserving process results in an estimate rather than
an exact calculation of liabilities.

     Liabilities for self insured losses, including loss adjustment
expenses, are revalued periodically using a variety of actuarial
and statistical techniques for producing current estimates of
expected claim costs.  Claim frequency and severity and other
social and economic factors are considered in the valuation
process.  A provision for inflation in the calculation of future
claim costs is implicit since reliance is placed on both actual
historical data which reflect past inflation and on factors which
are judged to be appropriate additions to or modifiers of past
experience such as industry experience.  Adjustments to previously
estimated liabilities in connection with establishing self
insurance reserves are reflected in current operating results in
<PAGE>
the period in which they are determined. 


COMPETITION

     The waste services industry is very competitive and requires
substantial labor and capital resources.  The Company encounters
competition from national, regional and local companies by locality
and by type of service.  Some national waste services companies are
much larger and have greater resources than the Company.  The
Company also competes with municipalities and industrial facilities
which provide their own waste management services.  Competition in
the Company's markets is based primarily on service, reliability,
and price.


EMPLOYEES

     The Company currently employs approximately 1,730 persons,
consisting of approximately 90 managers and executives,
approximately 1,050 persons employed in collection, transfer,
resource recovery and disposal activities, approximately 230
persons employed in equipment repair and maintenance, and
approximately 360 persons employed in sales, clerical, data
processing and other activities.  Approximately 28% of the
Company's employees are represented by a union under collective
bargaining agreements.  The Company did not experience a
significant work stoppage in any of the reporting periods covered
by this Form 10-K and believes its employee relations are good.



Item 2. Properties.

     The principal fixed assets of the Company consist of vehicles
and equipment which include approximately 1,250 collection,
recycling, transfer and support vehicles, an estimated 810,000
storage containers, roll-off boxes and recycling bins, and
approximately 230 portable and stationary compactors.  

     The Company owns approximately 2,720 acres of real property,
including approximately 2,470 acres used or being developed as
landfills.  It leases an additional 90 acres of which 64 acres are
for landfill.  The total space of all buildings utilized by the
Company is approximately 500,000 square feet.  

     The Company purchased certain general office facilities in
Torrance, California in December 1991.  A portion of these
facilities is being used for the Company's corporate headquarters. 
The remaining facilities are currently being leased to outside
parties.
<PAGE>
     Management believes that the Company's property and equipment
are adequate for its present business needs.  The Company intends,
however, to continue to invest in additional property and equipment
for both expansion and replacement of existing assets.



Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

     On or about October 13, 1993 the Company was served with a
class action lawsuit now entitled In re Western Waste Industries
Securities Litigation, Case No. CV-93 6126 KN filed in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California.  The
complaint alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws
with regard to certain disclosures and representations made by the
Company and certain alleged omissions on the part of the Company in
connection with merger negotiations between the Company and
Browning-Ferris Industries ("BFI").  The plaintiffs allege that
they and all other persons or entities that bought the stock of the
Company during the period of September 2, 1993 through October 7,
1993 suffered damages as a result of changes in the market price of
the Company's common stock.  The Company does not believe that it
has violated any laws with regard to the BFI matter and intends to
vigorously defend the lawsuit.
     
     On or about August 9, 1994 a complaint was filed in Rancho
Disposal Services, Inc., et al. v. Western Waste Industries, et
al., San Bernardino Superior Court Case No. SCB 14473.  The
Complaint seeks damages and an injunction for the alleged violation
of California Business and Professions Code Sections 17047, 17200,
and 17500 and for intentional interference with existing and
prospective economic relations.  The complaint alleges that the
Company does not hold a validly issued permit to operate within a
certain geographic area in the County of San Bernardino and that
the Company has engaged in predatory pricing.  The complaint also
alleges that the Company has violated a San Bernardino County
ordinance by engaging in discriminatory and non-uniform pricing of
its refuse hauling services.  In addition to the injunction, the
complaint prays for three times the actual damages incurred by
plaintiffs, punitive and exemplary damages in the amount to be
proven at the time of trial, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
of suit.  The Company believes it has valid defenses to the
allegations and intends to vigorously defend the suit.  The Company
also intends to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs for
engaging in improper pricing activities.

     In July 1994, the Company reached an agreement to settle the
claims asserted against it in a lawsuit captioned County of Los
Angeles, et al. v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., et al., Case
No. 93-1807-WMS filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The
complaint sought indemnification on behalf of the County of Los
Angeles for alleged damages resulting from hauling waste from
<PAGE>
county garbage districts to the Operating Industries Landfill.  The
settlement was within the range previously accrued.  The settlement
includes a release by the EPA with regard to the Operating
Industries site.

     In addition to the above-described litigation, there are
number of claims and suits pending against the Company for alleged
damages to persons and property, alleged  violation of certain laws
and for alleged liabilities arising out of matters occurring during
the normal operation of the waste services business.  In the
opinion of management, the uninsured liability, if any, under these
claims and suits would not materially affect the financial position
of the Company.

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, no matter was

Item  7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
           Condition and Results of Operations


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue

     The increases in revenue over the last three fiscal years have
resulted from price increases, obtaining additional franchise
agreements, expanding the customer base, acquiring certain assets of
other waste management businesses and expanding landfill operations.  



     Components of the increases in revenue are as follows:


                                             Year Ended June 30,
                                        1992      1993      1994

 Purchased assets . . . . . . . . .     3.7%      2.8%       .2%
 Price and volume changes . . . . .     6.1       2.6      11.0 
                                        9.8%      5.4%     11.2%


     The Company's revenue growth was impacted negatively in fiscal
1993 by (i) the reduction in commercial waste volumes due to the
economic recession which affected many of its markets, particularly
California, (ii) state and local waste minimization requirements, (iii)
the emphasis of many commercial collection customers, as a result of
the recession, on controlling and reducing operating costs, which leads
to downward pressure on pricing, and (iv) the downward pressure on
pricing as a result of increased competition.  

     The principal factor in the decline of revenue growth in fiscal
1993 was the continuation of the nationwide economic recession,
particularly in California.  Recent evidence indicates that the economy
is recovering from the recession, albeit slowly.  This improvement in
the economy was a ingredient in the revenue growth realized in fiscal
1994, in conjunction with new operations in San Jose and Sunnyvale,
California. It is very difficult to predict the future of the economy
and as such, no assurances can be given about future operations, but it
is anticipated that as the recession abates, revenue and operating
results should continue to improve.  


Costs of Operation

     Operating expenses, consisting primarily of wages and benefits for
operating personnel, insurance costs, disposal site fees and equipment
<PAGE>
operating costs, were 75.3% of revenue in fiscal 1992, 81.2% in fiscal
1993 and 74.7% in fiscal 1994.  Operating costs increased in fiscal
1993, as a percentage of revenue, due primarily to charges of (i)
$6,000,000 related to a estimated loss on a municipal contract, and
(ii) $4,000,000 related to increases in self-insurance reserves. 
Operating costs decreased in fiscal 1994, as a percentage of revenue,
due principally to (i) charges incurred in fiscal 1993 previously noted
(ii) increases in volume at the Companys' landfill operations,
including an increase in the volume of out-of-county waste at the
Company's  El Sobrante California landfill site, which generally have
lower operating costs than waste collection operations and (iii)
revenue growth resulting from rate increases.     

     On June 30, 1992, the Company entered into an agreement with the
City of San Jose, to provide refuse and recycling services, for a term
of six years, with service beginning July 1, 1993.  During the initial
months of the contract, it became apparent that the level of services
required for the contract and related costs of operation would be
greater than originally envisioned.  This occurred, in part, by factors
outside of the control of the Company.  As a consequence, most of the
increased cost could not have been anticipated or estimated prior to
the start of the contract.   The Company estimated that it would incur
a loss of $6,000,000 over the life of the contract, in order to satisfy
the service requirements of the contract and accordingly accrued that
amount in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993.  The balance of this
accrual was approximately $3,000,000 as of June 30, 1994.  Based upon
facts presently known to it, the Company believes that the balance of
this accrual is adequate to cover any future losses related to this
contract.

     In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 the Company performed a
detailed analysis, considering the trend of increasing development of
known claims, along with the pattern shown by payments made in
settlement of self-insured losses. As a result of this analysis, the
Company increased its reserve for self-insured losses by $4,000,000. 
The Company performed a similar analysis in fiscal 1994 and determined
that the estimated reserve balances remain adequate.  The process of
estimating loss reserves is a difficult and complex exercise involving
many variables, uncertainties, and subjective judgements, and
therefore, there is no assurance that the reserve balance will reduce
the possibility of adverse reserve developments in subsequent reporting
periods. 


Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

     Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of
revenue approximated 16.0% in fiscal 1992 and 1993, and 15.0% in 1994. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage
of revenue in fiscal 1994 due primarily to the Company's continuing
effort to control costs in conjunction with the revenue growth
discussed above.  In early fiscal 1994, the Company reviewed its
<PAGE>
selling, general and administrative expense levels as compared to the
industry and subsequently set a goal to reduce these levels below 15%. 
     

Special Charges

     Special charges of $21,043,000 were included in fiscal year 1993's
results of operations.  The Company re-evaluated its landfill  
activity in fiscal 1993, focusing on the economic viability of landfill
projects under development and  closure and post-closure requirements. 
As a result of revised projections, estimates, and certain regulatory
communications on permitting activity in progress, the Company recorded
special charges in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 of (i) $10,143,000
related to writeoffs and reserves for certain landfill development
projects and (ii) $6,900,000 to establish additional reserves, above
those estimated to be required on an ongoing annual basis, for
potential future expenditures relating to the long-term requirements
for closure/post closure management of certain  Company landfills. 
Also as a part of the Company's review of facilities and land
requirements, the Company recorded a $2,000,000 general reserve for
property no longer needed for operations and established a loss reserve
of $2,000,000 for other matters.  The balance of this accrual was
$12,029,000 as of June 30, 1994.  Company management believes that the
components of this reserve remain adequate as of June 30, 1994. 


Interest Expense

     Interest expense decreased $437,000 or 11.2% in fiscal 1993, and
then increased $354,000 or 10.2% in fiscal 1994.  The decrease in
fiscal 1993 was due to lower borrowing rates, partially offset by
increased borrowings.  The increase in interest expense in fiscal 1994
was due primarily to higher average debt levels as compared to the
prior fiscal year.  Total debt in fiscal 1994 averaged approximately
$93,000,000 as compared to approximately $87,000,000 in fiscal 1993. 
The Company capitalized interest costs of $1,753,000, $1,151,000 and
$953,000 in fiscal 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively, related to the
development of certain landfill and other construction projects.


Non-Operating Income (Expense)

     A writedown of $6,600,000 related to G.I. Industries was included
in Other non-operating income (expense) in fiscal 1992.  In April of
1992, negotiations with G.I. Industries over the proposed acquisition
of that company were terminated.  As a result, the Company
substantially wrote down its investment in GII to reflect the estimated
net realizable value.  No material changes to this item have occurred
since the reserve was established.

     The Company recorded a gain of $2,800,000 in the third quarter of
fiscal 1993 related to the sale of the Company's equity investment in
<PAGE>
common stock of Best Pak Disposal.  This gain is included in Other non-
operating income (expense) in fiscal 1993.

     During May of 1992, the Company made the decision to cease
operations and sell or otherwise dispose of its truck body
manufacturing division, Stagg Equipment Company (Stagg).  The decision
to dispose of Stagg came after the Company reassessed the division's
prospects in light of the continuing economic downturn, which
significantly affected anticipated outside demand.  In connection with
the decision to dispose of Stagg, the Company recorded a fiscal 1992
provision of $4,050,000 to reflect the estimated loss on disposition,
including estimated future costs and operating results from Stagg until
the completion of the disposal.  In November 1993, the Company
completed the disposal with the exception of payments to be made on a
long-term lease which will expire in November 1995.  These payments
were provided for in the estimated loss. The balance of the reserve was
approximately $1,262,000 as of June 30, 1994.


Income Taxes

     The effective income tax rates for fiscal 1992, 1993, and 1994
were 44%, 30% and 45%, respectively.  The effective rates for all years
were higher than the statutory federal rate (34% for 1992 and 1993 and
35% for 1994) due primarily to the effect of state income taxes and
nondeductible expenses.  The effective rate for 1994 reflects a $86,000
reduction related to the recent change in the federal corporate income
tax rate from 34% to 35%, retroactive to July 1, 1993 in accordance
with the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993.  In fiscal 1994, the
Company recognized a benefit of $414,000 from the adoption of FASB 109. 
The Company has a net deferred tax asset of $2,372,000 at June 30,
1994, all of which the Company has determined is more likely than not
to be realized due to available taxable income in the carryback period.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The solid waste industry is capital intensive.  The Company has
financed its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from
operations, borrowings and issuances of common stock.  Cash provided by
operations was $36,242,000 and $35,320,000 in fiscal 1993 and 1994,
respectively, while additions to debt provided $13,515,000 and
$15,028,000 in those fiscal years, respectively.  These funds have been
used to purchase property and equipment, to acquire certain assets of
other waste services companies, to develop and expand new and existing
landfill sites, and to finance the Company's expansion of services.

     The Company's $100 million revolving line of credit ("the
agreement"), which currently matures on June 1, 1997, has a $16.5
million quarterly commitment reduction commencing March 1, 1996.  On or
before the first day of October of each year, the Company has an option
<PAGE>
to request an extension of the revolving period and the termination
date with the approval of its banks.  The Company has exercised this
option and is currently awaiting the approval of its banks.  If this
option is approved, the termination date shall be extended to June 1,
1999, the quarterly commitment reduction date shall be extended to
March 1, 1997, and the quarterly commitment reduction will be reduced
from $16.5 million to $10 million.  Thereafter, each extension request
shall be for a period of one year.  


Working Capital

     At June 30, 1993 and 1994, working capital amounted to $13,261,000
and $20,660,000, respectively.  The current ratio was 1.6 to 1 at June
30, 1994 as compared to 1.4 to 1 a year earlier.  The increase in the
current ratio was due primarily to (i) a decrease of $2,661,000 in the
current portion of a contract loss accrual recorded as of June 30, 1993
and (ii) an increase of $7,676,000 in cash and short-term investments. 
The increase in cash and short-term investments was used principally
for certain commitments and debt reduction totaling $7,600,000 which
were paid at the beginning of fiscal 1995.  Trade receivables represent
the largest portion of current assets totaling $24,297,000 and
$30,244,000 at June 30, 1993 and 1994, respectively.  The increase in
trade receivables was due primarily to new operations in San Jose and
Sunnyvale, California.   Days sales in trade receivables were 36 days
for fiscal 1993 and 37 days for fiscal 1994.  The allowance for
doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade receivables was 5.6% and
5.3% at the end of fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1994, respectively.


Capital Resources

     In December 1992, the Company renegotiated its revolving line of
credit thereby increasing the amount available from $80,000,000 to
$100,000,000.   At the Company's option, borrowings under the agreement
bear interest at the bank's prime rate and/or at the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .75 to 2.0 per cent, (1.25 per cent at June
30, 1994), depending upon certain ratios.   Outstanding borrowings
under the agreement were $82,000,000 at June 30, 1994.  

     During the year ended June 30, 1994, the Company made capital
additions of approximately $35 million.  The Company estimates that
capital additions for fiscal 1995 will be approximately $30 million. 
The Company believes that cash provided by operations, cash available
under its revolving credit agreement, lease agreements, and cash from
other external sources will be sufficient for its financing needs.

Inflation

     Inflation has had a minimal impact on the Company's operations for
the periods referred to above as most of the Company's collection
operations are under contracts that provide for rate adjustments based
upon increases in the consumer price index.  These contracts reduce the
Company's vulnerability to inflation.  However, in the case of rapid
changes in certain costs, such as fuel and disposal costs, rate
increases may lag behind cost increases.



Environmental Matters

     Closure and post-closure costs are accrued and charged to cost of
operations over the estimated useful lives of such facilities. These
accruals are based on estimates from management reviews performed
periodically. The closure and post-closure requirements for the
Company's municipal solid waste landfills are established by Subtitle
D or the applicable states' adopted and EPA approved Subtitle D
implementation plan. In performing the review for each facility, the
Company analyzes actual costs incurred versus total estimated costs,
updates prior cost estimates to reflect current regulatory requirement,
and considers requirements of proposed regulatory changes. 

     Closure and post-closure accruals consider final capping of the
site, site inspections, ground-water monitoring, leachate management,
methane gas control and recovery, and operation and maintenance costs
to be incurred during the period after the facility closes.   
     
     The Company accounts for closure and post-closure accruals by
comparing the total estimated closure and post-closure cost with the
existing reserve. The difference is accrued and charged to cost of
operations as airspace is consumed.

                   Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Directors and Shareholders
Western Waste Industries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western
Waste Industries and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1993 and 1994 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1994.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Western Waste Industries and subsidiaries at June 30, 1993
and 1994, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.


As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in
1994 the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

Western Waste Industries  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Western Waste Industries is a integrated solid waste services company,
providing collection, recycling, composting and disposal services for
commercial, industrial and residential customers.  The Company operates
as a single business segment.

Note 1  Summary of significant accounting policies:

Principles of consolidation-The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany  accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.  

Cash and short term investments-Short term investments generally
consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less.

Property and equipment-Property and equipment are recorded at cost. 
Landfill sites and site improvements are carried at cost and to the
extent this exceeds estimated end use realizable value, such excess is
amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the site.  
Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of major
facilities.  The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset
to which it relates and is amortized over the asset's useful life.  In
fiscal 1993 and 1994, respectively, $1,151,000 and $953,000 of interest
cost was capitalized.   Depreciation and amortization of other property
and equipment are provided for by using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives.  Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the life of the improvement or the term of the
lease.

Purchased routes-Purchased routes are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the contract periods or estimated service periods, generally
10 years.  Accumulated amortization at June 30, 1993 and 1994 was
$15,932,000 and $16,640,000, respectively.

Goodwill-Consideration paid in excess of the fair market value of net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and is amortized on a straight-
line basis over 40 years.  Accumulated amortization at June 30, 1993
and 1994 was $2,088,000 and $2,794,000, respectively.

Deferred bond issue costs-Expenses related to the issuance of Pollution
Control Revenue Bonds and Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (see Note
7) are included in other assets and are amortized over the life of the
bonds using the straight-line method.  At June 30, 1993 and 1994, the
unamortized portion of deferred bond issue costs amounted to $341,000
and $286,000, respectively.

Closure and post-closure reserves-The Company will have material
financial obligations relating to closure and post-closure costs of
landfill facilities it operates or for which it is otherwise
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
responsible. While the precise amount of these future obligations
cannot be determined, the Company has estimated that total costs for
final closure of its existing facilities and post-closure activities,
will approximate $22,760,000.  Closure and post-closure accruals
consider final capping of the site, site inspections, ground-water
monitoring, leachate management, methane gas control and recovery, and
operation and maintenance costs to be incurred during the period after
the facility closes.   
 
     Closure and post-closure costs are accrued and charged to cost of
operations over the estimated useful lives of such facilities. These
accruals are based on estimates from management reviews performed
periodically. The closure and post-closure requirements for the
Company's municipal solid waste landfills are established by Subtitle
D or the applicable states' adopted and EPA approved Subtitle D
implementation plan. In performing the review for each facility, the
Company analyzes actual costs incurred versus total estimated costs,
updates prior cost estimates to reflect current regulatory requirement,
and considers requirements of proposed regulatory changes. 

     The Company accounts for closure and post-closure accruals by
comparing the total estimated closure and post-closure cost with the
existing reserve. The difference is accrued and charged to cost of
operations as airspace is consumed.

     The Company had closure and post-closure reserves as follows:

                                                                 June 30,         
                                                                1993          1994

        Current portion included in 
          Other Current Liabilities                     $  3,665,000  $  2,019,000 
        Non-current portion included in
          Other Liabilities                                5,926,000     5,617,000
                                                        $  9,591,000  $  7,636,000
        
</TABLE>
 
Marketable Securities-In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 115
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". 
The Statement would require the Company to report its investment in 
marketable securities (see Note 5) at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity. 
The Company is required to adopt this statement in fiscal 1995 and the
effect of this adoption is not anticipated to be material to the
financial position or results of operations of the Company. 


Note 2  Special Charges 

     In fiscal 1993, the Company incurred special charges in the amount
of $21,043,000.  These charges included principally (i) writeoffs and
reserves of $10,143,000 related to certain landfill development
<PAGE>
projects (ii) a provision of $6,900,000 for additional reserves for
potential future expenditures relating to the long-term requirements
for closure/post closure management of certain of the Company's
landfills and (iii) a general reserve of $4,000,000 for property no
longer needed for operations and other matters.  



Note 3  Acquisitions/Divestitures:

     The Company purchased the routes and certain other assets of six, 
four and one company(ies) in 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively.  All of
the acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase method.  The
results of the acquired operations have been included in the Company's
operations since the date of acquisition.

     Total consideration paid for the 1992 acquisitions was
$13,676,000, consisting of $4,141,000 cash, $6,252,000 notes payable,
$1,075,000 assumed debt and $2,208,000 in capital stock.  In exchange
for this consideration, the Company allocated $5,538,000 to tangible
assets and purchased routes and the remainder of $8,138,000 was
recorded as goodwill.    

     Total consideration paid for the 1993 acquisitions was $654,000,
consisting of $356,000 cash and of $298,000 notes payable.  

     Total consideration paid for the 1994 acquisition was $35,000,
paid in cash.  

     The Company's financial results for the years ended June 30, 1992,
1993, and 1994 would not be materially different if the results of all
acquisitions were included as though the acquisitions occurred at the
beginning of each period.

     In October 1990, the Company issued 300,000 shares of its common
stock in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of a waste
collection company.  This transaction, which was not material to the
Company's financial position or results of operations when originally
recorded in fiscal 1991, was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests at
that time.  However, as a result of new information, it was determined
in fiscal 1993 that the transaction would have been more properly
recorded by using the purchase method.  Accordingly, the financial
statements for the year ended June 30, 1993 reflect this revision.  As
the effect was not material, financial statements for prior years were
not restated.  Total consideration paid for this acquisition was
$9,310,000 consisting of 300,000 shares of capital stock at a
guaranteed price of $30 per share and $310,000 in assumed debt in
excess of assets acquired.  In exchange for this consideration, the
Company allocated $1,215,000 to purchased routes and $8,095,000 to
goodwill.  As part of this transaction the Company issued 240,000
shares of common stock in fiscal 1994 as renumeration for a stock price
guarantee.  
<PAGE>
     In April 1992, the Company sold certain assets and routes in
California for $1,949,000.  The Company recognized a gain of
approximately $537,000, which is included in Nonoperating income
(expense) - Other in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.      

     In February 1993, the Company sold its equity investment in the
outstanding common stock of Best Pak Disposal resulting in a gain of
$2,800,000.  As part of this transaction, the Company received 75,000
shares of common stock of USA Waste, the value of which is included in
other current assets.  The gain of $2,800,000 was included in
nonoperating income (expense)-other in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended June 30, 1993.

</TABLE>
     In April 1992, negotiations with GII over the proposed acquisition
of that company were terminated.  As a result, the Company
substantially wrote-down its investment in GII to reflect the estimated
net realizable value.  Writedowns related to GII totaled $6,600,000,
including investments, advances and certain direct acquisition costs. 
This writedown was included in nonoperating income (expense) - other,
in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended June 30,
1992.  In April 1993, the Company received an Order of the Bankruptcy
Court allowing the Company to setoff a debt to a GII Industries
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
shareholder in the amount of $2,465,000 against the advances to GII,
which were personally guaranteed by this shareholder.    

     In fiscal 1992, the Company entered into a joint development
arrangement with two other companies, for the purpose of developing a
waste-by-rail project called California Inter-Rail.  The project is in
the preliminary permitting stage and expects to receive solid waste
from throughout Southern California.  The preliminary permitting cost
estimate is approximately $5,000,000 for each member of the joint
development team.  The Company's investment in this venture totaled
$2,175,000 and $3,073,000 at June 30, 1993 and 1994, respectively.


Note 6  Other current liabilities:

     Other current liabilities consist of the following:
                                                                   June 30,

        Closure and post-closure reserves                  3,665,000    2,019,000

     The Company has a risk management program whereby it retains the
liability, subject to maximum limits, for auto, general liability, 
employee health and welfare benefits and workers' compensation.   As
required by law, the Company has pledged certain marketable securities,
and has established a letter of credit in the amount of $1,024,000 as
of June 30, 1994, to guarantee its workers' compensation obligations in
California.  The Company establishes self insured  losses and loss
adjustment expenses based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims
which have been reported but not fully paid, and of claims which have
been incurred but not yet reported.  The length of time for which such
costs must be estimated varies depending on the coverage involved. 
Actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as
inflation, changes in doctrine of legal liability and size of damage
awards.  Because of the variables involved, the reserving process
results in an estimate rather than an exact calculation of liabilities. 


The estimated liability for uninsured claims at June 30, 1994, included
in other current liabilities and other liabilities, consists of the
following:

      Aggregate principal amounts of long-term debt at June 30, 1994,
including capital leases, are due as follows:

                                           Year Ended 
                                            June 30, 
                   1995                   $ 1,526,000
                   1996                    15,610,000 
                   1997                    66,469,000
                   1998                     1,293,000
                   1999                       265,000
                   Thereafter               8,227,000
                                          $93,390,000


       The revolving line of credit (the "agreement"), which currently
matures on June 1, 1997, permits borrowings up to $100,000,000.  At the
Company's option, borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the
</TABLE>
<PAGE>
bank's prime rate and/or at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus .75 to 2.0 per cent, (1.25 per cent at June 30, 1994), depending
upon certain ratios.  The agreement has a $16.5 million quarterly
commitment reduction commencing March 1, 1996.  On or before the first
day of October of each year, the Company has an option to request an
extension of the revolving period and the termination date with the
approval of its banks.  The Company has exercised this option and
currently is awaiting the approval of its banks.  If this option is
approved, the termination date shall be extended to June 1, 1999, the
quarterly commitment reduction date shall be extended to March 1, 1997,
and the quarterly commitment reduction will be reduced from $16.5
million to $10 million.  Thereafter, each extension request shall be
for a period of one year.     The agreement requires no compensating
balances.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is subject to
various debt covenants including maintenance of certain financial
ratios, and in addition, it limits the amount of cash dividends.    

     At June 30, 1993, obligations related to capital expenditures in
the amount of $8,682,000 were classified as long-term debt.  Funds
available under the revolving line of credit provided management with
the ability to refinance this debt, in early 1994, on a long-term
basis.  The obligations were classified as long-term debt and included
in the notes payable to banks classification above.  

     Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds issued by the California
Pollution Control Financing Authority are secured by a solid waste
landfill facility constructed with bond proceeds.  The bonds bear
interest at a floating rate set weekly until conversion to a fixed
rate, at the option of the Company, for the remaining term of the
bonds.  As of June 30, 1994, the company has not exercised its option
of conversion to a fixed rate.  The Company also has an option to
redeem the bonds prior to maturity  at the redemption price ranging
from 100% to 103% depending on the redemption date.  At June 30, 1994,
the Company established in the trustee's favor an irrevocable letter of
credit for the principal amount of $8,200,000 plus 123 days accrued
interest on the bonds to guarantee repayment.  

     Pollution Control Revenue Bonds issued by the California Pollution
Control Financing Authority are secured by a solid waste disposal
facility constructed with bond proceeds.  Revenue from the operation of
the solid waste disposal facility is pledged to secure repayment of the
bonds.  The Company is required to deposit into a Reserve Fund an
amount equal to three months' debt service (principal and interest).
The Reserve Fund balances at June 30, 1993 and 1994 were $527,000 and
$546,000 respectively, and have been deducted from bond principal
outstanding.  Bond repayment is guaranteed up to a maximum of 80
percent by the Federal Small Business Administration.  

     At June 30, 1994, $10,328,000 of long-term debt was collateralized
by land, buildings and equipment with a carrying value of $8,965,000. 
Interest paid during fiscal years 1992, 1993 and 1994 was $5,217,000,
$5,010,000, and $4,652,000, respectively.

     The fair value of the Company's long term debt calculated using
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturities is not materially different from the amounts included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.   


Note 8  Income taxes:

     Effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  Under the liability
method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the
difference between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities, using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse.  Taxes previously accrued will be
adjusted for changes in tax rates as they become effective as opposed to when
the taxes were recorded.  The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 was
a $414,000 benefit to income.  As permitted under the new rules, prior year
financial statements have not been restated. 

     Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of
June 30, 1994 were as follows:


Deferred tax assets:

     The Company made income tax payments of $5,919,000, $5,014,000,
and $5,995,000 during fiscal years 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively.


     The Company's corporate tax returns are currently being audited by
the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 1989 through 1993.  The
IRS has proposed adjustments for these years, which the Company is
vigorously protesting, which neither alone nor together would have a
material effect on the Company's financial statements, when resolved.



Note 9  Shareholders' equity:
     
     Notes receivable of $598,000  and $154,000, due from employees for
the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock under stock option
plans, have been deducted from shareholders' equity at June 30, 1993
and 1994, respectively.

     During fiscal 1994, the Company accepted as settlement of a
receivable, 97,000 shares of common stock valued at $970,000.  The
shares were canceled and returned to authorized but unissued status.
     
     The Company issued 240,000 shares of common stock in fiscal 1994
as renumeration for a stock price guarantee related to an acquisition
which took place in fiscal 1991 (See Note 3).

     Primary and fully diluted earnings per share are computed on the
basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the
common stock equivalents which would arise from the exercise of stock
options as follows:


                                                       Year Ended June 30,

     The Company presently maintains three stock option plans affording
key employees and directors with the Company the right to purchase
shares of its common stock.  At June 30, 1994, options were available
for future grants only under one of the plans, the Companys 1992 Stock
Option Plan.  The options may be designated as incentive or non-
qualified in nature, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors, though only employees are eligible to receive
incentive stock options.  The Company has reserved 2,000,000 shares
under its Incentive Stock Option Plan (ISOP) and an additional
2,000,000 shares under its Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.  In
addition, the 1992 plan provides for the reserve of 2,000,000 shares
</TABLE>
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
which are to be designated as either qualified or non-qualified.  The
plans provide for the granting of options at a purchase price of at
least 100% of the fair market value on the date the options are
granted.  Options are generally exercisable in instalments beginning
one year after the grant date.


     Information with respect to options granted under the plans is as

Note 10  Commitments and other items:

     The Company leases a portion of its equipment and facilities which
are classified as operating leases.

     Minimum rental commitments (exclusive of property tax, insurance
and maintenance) under all non-cancelable operating leases are due at
June 30, 1994, as follows:

                                 1995                         $ 5,187,000
                                 1996                           2,188,000
                                 1997                              80,000
                                 
                                       
     Included above is a lease with the Company's President, which is
due to expire in fiscal 1995, for the rental of one of the Company's
buildings.  The rental rate is, in management's opinion, comparable to
that which would have been entered into with independent third parties.
</TABLE>
<PAGE>
      Rental expense approximated $10,951,000, $11,415,000 and
$10,156,000 for the  fiscal years ended June 30, 1992, 1993 and 1994,
respectively.  These amounts include rental payments to the President
of approximately $167,000, $172,000 and $161,000 for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively.

     The Company has a 401(k) plan which covers  all full time salaried
and clerical employees not represented by a bargaining agreement. 
Eligible employees are allowed to contribute up to the maximum allowed
by law.  At its discretion, the Company can match up to 50% of the
amount contributed by employees. The Company's contributions for 1992,
1993, and 1994, represented by issuance of Company common stock, were
$504,000 and $506,000, and $566,000, respectively.

     In May 1992, the Company made the decision to cease operations and
sell or otherwise dispose of its truck body manufacturing division,
Stagg Equipment Company (Stagg).  The decision to dispose of Stagg came
after the Company reassessed the division's prospects in light of the
continuing economic downturn, which significantly affected anticipated
outside demand.  In connection with the decision to dispose of Stagg,
the Company recorded a fiscal 1992 provision of $4,050,000 to reflect
the estimated loss on disposition and the estimated future operating
results from Stagg until the completion of its disposal.  In November
1993, the Company completed the disposal with the exception of payments
to be made on a long-term lease which will expire in November 1995.


Note 11  Litigation:

     The Company was served on October 13, 1993 with a class action
lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the Company violated federal
securities laws with regard to certain disclosures and representations
made by the Company and certain alleged omissions on the part of the
Company in connection with merger negotiations between the Company and
Browning-Ferris Industries ("BFI").  The plaintiffs allege that they
and all other persons or entities that bought the stock of the Company
during the period of September 2, 1993 through October 7, 1993 suffered
damages as a result of changes in the market price of the Company's
common stock.  The Company does not believe that it has violated any
laws with regard to the BFI matter and intends to vigorously defend the
lawsuit.
     
     The Company was served on August 9, 1994 with a complaint filed by
certain refuse haulers in San Bernardino County alleging that the
Company violated certain California Business and Professions Code
Sections and also intentionally interfered with existing and
prospective economic relations.  The complaint alleges that the Company
does not hold a validly issued permit to operate within a certain
geographic area in the County of San Bernardino and that the Company
has engaged in a course of conduct of predatory pricing.  The complaint
also alleges that the Company has violated a San Bernardino County
ordinance by engaging in discriminatory and non-uniform pricing of its
<PAGE>
refuse hauling services.  In addition to the injunction, the complaint
prays for three times the actual damages incurred by plaintiffs,
punitive and exemplary damages in the amount to be proven at the time
of trial, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit.  The Company
believes it has valid defenses to the allegations and intends to
vigorously defend the suit.  The Company also intends to file a cross-
complaint against the plaintiffs for engaging in improper pricing
activities.

     The Company was named by the County of Los Angeles in regard to an
indemnification action by the County for collection of alleged damages
resulting from hauling waste from County garbage districts to the
Operating Industries Landfill.  The Company and some of its prior
subsidiaries hauled waste to the Operating Industries site for certain
defendant cities and also hauled waste through two defendant county
garbage districts in the County of Los Angeles.  In July 1994, the
Company reached an agreement to settle the claims for the amount of
$3,600,000, and received insurance proceeds of $1,200,000 as of June
30, 1994. This amount fell within the range previously accrued.  The
settlement includes a release by the EPA with regard to the Operating
Industries site.   

     In addition to the above, there are a number of claims and suits
pending against the Company  for alleged damages to persons and
property, alleged violation of certain laws and for alleged liabilities
arising out of matters occurring during the normal operation of the
waste management business.  In the opinion of management, the uninsured
liability, if any, under the aforementioned claims and suits would not
materially affect the financial position of the Company.


Note 12  Loss on Municipal Contract:

     On June 30, 1992, the Company entered into an agreement with the
City of San Jose, to provide refuse and recycling services, for a term
of six years, with service beginning July 1, 1993.  During the initial
months of the contract, it became apparent that the level of services
required for the contract and related costs of operation would be
greater than originally envisioned.  This occurred, in part, by factors
outside of the control of the Company.  As a consequence, most of the
increased cost could not have been anticipated or estimated prior to
the start of the contract.   The Company estimated that it would incur
a loss of $6,000,000 over the life of the contract, in order to satisfy
the service requirements of the contract and accordingly accrued that
amount.  The balance of this accrual was approximately $3,000,000 as of
June 30, 1994.  Based upon facts presently known to it, the Company
believes that the balance of this accrual is adequate to cover any
future losses related to this contract.

                          EXHIBIT 10.11
                    WESTERN WASTE INDUSTRIES
                        1992 OPTION PLAN


1.   Establishment and Purpose of Plan
     Western Waste Industries (hereinafter referred to as the
"Company") proposes to grant to directors, officers and key
employees of the Company non-qualified options or incentive stock
options (hereinafter referred to in the aggregate as "Options")
or a combination of each to purchase shares of the Company's
Common Stock ("Common Stock"), for the purpose of attracting and
retaining directors, officers and key employees of ability and
experience. Such Options will be granted pursuant to the Plan
(hereinafter referred to as the "Plan"). As used in the Plan, the
term "Incentive Stock Option" means an option described in
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
term "Non-Qualified Stock Option" means a stock option other than
an Incentive Stock Option.  

2.   Maximum Number of Shares Subject to Options.
     A maximum of 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 6 below), may be issued
upon exercise of the Options granted under the Plan. Subject to
the foregoing limitation upon the number of shares which may be
issued upon exercise of Options, shares covered by the
unexercised portion of any Option which has terminated by its
terms or which was canceled pursuant to Section 13 hereof may be
subject to a subsequent Option granted under the plan.

3.   Administration of the Plan.
     The authority to grant Options under the Plan shall be
vested in the Board of Directors of the Company (hereinafter
referred to as the "Board") or in such committee as may be
appointed form time to time by the Board (which committee is
hereinafter referred to as the "Committee"). Subject to the
provisions of the Plan, the Board, or the Committee, from time to
time on the recommendation of the chief executive officer of the
Company, shall determine the directors, officers and key
employees to whom, and the time or times at which, Options shall
be granted; the number of shares to be subject to each option;
the period of each option and other terms and provisions of each
option. Options need not be identical. The Board may also
interpret the Plan; prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the plan; amend the plan from time to
time (subject to limitations set forth in Section 111); and make
all other determinations necessary or advisable for the
administration of the plan.


4.   Eligibility.
     a.  Incentive Stock Options may be granted to any employee
of the Company. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted under
<PAGE>
this Plan to any employee if the grant of such Incentive Stock
Options would cause the aggregate fair market value (determined
as of the date the Option is granted, hereinafter referred to as
the "Date of Grant") of the Common Stock with respect to which
Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by
such individual during any calendar year to exceed an amount
equal to $100,000.00.

     b.  Non-Qualified Stock Options may be granted only to
directors, officers or key employees of the Company.

     c.  Any director, officer or key employee who has been
granted an Option under this or any other stock option plan of
the Company may be granted an additional Option or Options under
this or any other such plan; subject, however, to any
restrictions that may be contained in any other such plan.

5.   Exercise Price.
     a.  The exercise price for shares under an Incentive Stock
Option shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of
such shares (110% if the optionee at the time the Option is
granted owns stock representing more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company) as
determined by the Board of Directors or the Committee on the Date
of grant, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6.

     b.  The price to be paid for shares covered by a Non-
Qualified Stock Option shall be not less than 50% of the fair
market value of such shares, as determined by the Board or the
Committee on the Date of Grant, subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 6, except that, with respect to Non-Qualified Stock
Options granted to directors, the price to be paid shall be not
less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares as
determined by the Board or Committee on the Date of Grant,
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6.

     In determining the fair market value of such shares, the
Board or Committee shall take into consideration the net book
value of such shares, the net income per share, liquidation value
and, if the Company's stock is publicly traded, the last sale
price reflected on an automated quotations system or listed on a
national securities exchange, as applicable, as of the Date of
Grant, or if no sale price is reported for such date, the last
sale price reported as of the last business day immediately
preceding the Date of Grant. The price of any shares purchased
under exercise of an Option shall be paid in full by any lawful
means at the time of each such exercise


6.  Adjustments.
     In the event of any change in the Common Stock through
merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock
dividend, stock split, or other change in the corporate or
capital structure (not including the issuance of additional
<PAGE>
shares of any class of the Company's stock for adequate
consideration received by the Company), appropriate adjustment
shall be made by the Board in the number of shares and the price
per share subject to outstanding Options, and in the number of
shares and, if any, the par value thereof of the aggregate number
of shares available for such Options as set forth in Section 2
hereof. Such adjustment shall be made so that the plan and
Options theretofore or thereafter to be issued thereunder shall
remain substantially the same as before such change, and so that
the benefits receivable under any outstanding Option shall not be
increased or decreased from those which the optionee had before
such change. The determination of any such adjustment by the
Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. Anything herein
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the dissolution
of the Company, or upon any merger or consolidation of the
Company where the Company is not the surviving corporation and
the surviving corporation does not agree to exchange its options
for Options granted under the plan, all Options granted under the
plan shall terminate and thereupon become null and void; but the
optionee shall have the right, immediately prior to such
dissolution, merger or consolidation, to exercise any such Option
without regard to any otherwise applicable restriction as to time
of exercise, other than expiration of the Option Period.

7.   Option Period and Limitation on Exercise.

     Options shall be exercisable at such times and for such
period (the "Option Period") as may be fixed by the Board or the
Committee at the Date of Grant.

8.   Effect of Termination of Director or Officer or Employee.

     a.  If an optionee ceases to be a director, officer or
employee of the Company, for any reason other than death, such
optionee may exercise his Options in accordance with their terms
only for a period of thirty (30) days after such cessation (but
not beyond the Option Period). Any exercise of Options after such
cessation may be only to the extent of the full number of shares
the optionee was entitled to purchase under the Option on the
date of such cessation. The Board, in its sole discretion, may
determine to accelerate the exercisability of all or any portion
of any such individual's Option upon any such cessation.

     b.  If an optionee dies while a director, officer or
employee of the Company, any Options held by the deceased
optionee will continue in effect and may be exercised in
accordance with their terms for a period of twelve (12) months
from the date of the optionee's death (but not beyond the Option
Period) by the executor or administrator of such optionee's
estate, or in the event there is no such executor or
administrator (or the person holding such position has been
discharged), then by the person or persons to whom the optionee's 
rights under the Option shall pass by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.
<PAGE>
     c.  Options shall not be affected by authorized leaves of
absence so long as the optionee continues to be director, officer
or employee of the Company.


9.   Nontransferability of Options.
     Options granted hereunder shall not be transferable except
to the executor or administrator of the optionee's duly appointed
and acting guardian or conservator, and shall be exercisable
during the optionee's lifetime only by the optionee or by such
guardian or conservator for the benefit of the optionee. Options
may, however, be surrendered to the Company for cancellation for
such consideration and upon such terms as may be mutually agreed
upon by the Company and the holder of such Options.

10.  Effective Date and Expiration of the Plan.
     The Plan becomes effective upon its adoption by the Board of
Directors and approval by an affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the
Company present and entitled to vote thereon at the annual
meeting of shareholders. Unless sooner terminated, the Plan's
authority to grant Options shall expire on November 5, 2002
("Expiration Date"), but the Plan shall remain in full force and
effect beyond the Expiration Date for all Options granted prior
to the Expiration Date.

11.  Amendment and Termination of the Plan Prior to Expiration    
     Date.

     At any time prior to the expiration of the Plan, the Board
may terminate, suspend, modify or amend the Plan, provided that:

     a.  No such modification or amendment shall, without
     the approval of the holders of a majority of the
     outstanding voting shares of the Company (i) increase,
     beyond the amount set forth in Section 2, the total
     number of shares which may be issued upon exercise of
     options granted under the Plan (except as provided in
     Section 6), (ii) provide for the grant of options
     having an option exercise price per share of Common
     Stock less than the amount set forth in Section 5, or
     (iii) postpone the date of the expiration of the Plan
     beyond that set forth in Section 10 above; and

     b.  In no event shall any termination, suspension,
     modification or amendment of the Plan alter or impair,
     without the consent of the respective optionee, any
     rights or obligations under Options theretofore granted
     under the Plan, subject only to adjustment or
     cancellation as provided in Section 6, 8, 12 and 13.

12.  Compliance with Applicable Law.

     This Plan, Options granted hereunder, and the issuance of
<PAGE>
Common Stock upon exercise of such Options are or may be subject
to compliance with various laws and rules, regulations and
policies of various regulatory bodies and agencies, including the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as now in effect or as may
hereafter be adopted or amended. The grant of Options under the
Plan and the issuance of Common stock upon the exercise thereof
are each expressly conditioned upon compliance with all such
laws, rules, regulations and policies, In the event that the
Company, after making reasonable efforts to do so, shall be
unable to obtain any necessary authorization or permit required
in order to implement this Plan or to issue Common Stock upon
exercise of Options granted hereunder, or is otherwise unable to
comply with any such applicable law, rule, regulation or policy,
the Company may decline to allow the exercise of any Option until
all such permits or authorizations are issued or until it can
effect such compliance. If it is ultimately determined, in the
sole judgment of the Board, that the Company cannot reasonably
obtain any such permit or authorization or effect such
compliance, unexercised Options affected thereby shall thereupon
be canceled upon notice to the holders of such Options, all
without any liability whatsoever of the Company to any optionee.

13.  Cancellation or Amendment of Options.
     At any time prior to the expiration of the Plan, the Board
may, with the written consent of the optionee, cancel or modify
all Options, or any portion thereof previously granted to such
optionee.

14.  No Rights as Shareholder.
     Optionee shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect
to any shares of Common Stock covered by the Option until the
date of the issuance of a stock certificate to him. Except as may
be provided under Section 6 of the Plan, no adjustment will made
for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior
to the date such stock certificate is issued.

15.  Optional Form of Payment for Shares.
     Payment for any number of shares of Common Stock of the
Company purchased pursuant to the exercise of Options granted
hereunder may, at the option of the optionee, be made by
delivering to the Company a number of shares of the Common Stock
of the Company having a fair market value (on the date such
Option is exercised) equal to the Option Price for such shares.

16.  Limitation of Rights; Employment Relationship.
     Neither the establishment of the Plan or any modifications
thereof, nor the grant of any Options hereunder, shall be
construed as giving to any optionee or other person any legal or
equitable right against the Company except as specifically
provided herein; and, in no event, shall the terms of employment
of any employee be modified or in any way be affected hereby.

Note: The foregoing 1992 Stock Option Plan was adopted by the
Board of Directors of Western Waste Industries on November 6,
<PAGE>
1992 and was approved by majority of the outstanding shares of
the Company's Common Stock present and entitled to vote thereon
at a meeting of shareholders duly held on January 31, 1994.

                    SECOND AMENDMENT TO LEASE

   This Second Amendment to Lease ("Second Amendment"), dated as of
February 28,1993, is entered into by and between KOSTI and MARIAN
SHIRVANIAN, husband and wife ("Lessor") and WESTERN WASTE
INDUSTRIES, a California corporation, formerly known as "Western
Refuse Hauling, Inc."(Tenant").

                              Recitals

   A. Lessor and Tenant entered into that certain Twenty-Five Year
Lease (the "Lease"), dated May 1, 1968, pursuant to which Lessor
leased to Tenant those premises in the County of Los Angeles, State
of California, described as: "Approximately two and one-half acres
known as 401 W. Francisco, together with approximately one acre
immediately adjacent to said property abutting on Main Street." 
The capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Lease,

    B.  The Lease was amended on March 24, 1983 (the "First
Amendment") to, among other things, increase the rental and to
provide for future rent adjustments.

    C.  Lessor and Tenant now desire to amend the Lease as
hereinafter provided.


                              Amendment

   NOW, THEREFORE, Lessor and Tenant agree as follows:
   
   1.  Expiration Date.  The first full paragraph on page 2 of the
Lease is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following is
substituted in place thereof:


     "TO HAVE AND TO HOLD said premises, together with the
     tenements, hereditaments, appurtenances and easements
     thereunto belonging, at the rental and upon the terms,
     conditions, covenants and agreements herein stated, for
     a term commencing on the 1st day of June 1968, and ending
     on the 28th day of February 1995, hereinafter called
     'said term'."


  2.  Monthly Base Rent. Lessor and Tenant agree that the monthly
basic guaranteed rent, as that term is defined in the First
Amendment, is as of the date of this Amendment, the sum of $14,457.

  3.  No Other Modification . Except as modified by this Second
Amendment, the Lease, as amended, remains in full force and effect.

  4.  Miscellaneous.  This Second Amendment shall bind, and shall
<PAGE>
inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties. 
This document may be executed in counterparts with the same force
and effect as if the parties had executed one instrument, and each
such counterpart shall constitute an original hereof.  No provision
of this Second Amendment that is held to be inoperative,
unenforceable or invalid shall affect the remaining provisions, and
to this end all provisions hereof are hereby declared to be
severable.  Time is of the essence of this Second Amendment.  This
Second Amendment shall be governed by the laws of the State of
California.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Second
Amendment to be duly executed as of the date first written above.
