ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

    GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS. 
    Medtronic, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Medtronic" or the 
    "company") was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1957. Medtronic 
    is the world's leading therapeutic medical device company, developing, 
    manufacturing and marketing therapies for improved cardiovascular and 
    neurological health. Primary products include implantable pacemaker 
    systems used for treatment of bradycardia, implantable tachyarrhythmia 
    management devices for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, mechanical 
    and tissue heart valves, balloon and guiding catheters used in 
    angioplasty, implantable neurostimulation and drug delivery systems, and 
    perfusion systems including blood oxygenators, centrifugal blood pumps, 
    autotransfusion systems and cannula products. More than half of 
    Medtronic's revenues are generated from the sale of implantable cardiac 
    pacemaker systems for treatment of bradycardia ("brady pacemakers"). These 
    systems consist of implantable pulse generators ("IPGs") and leads, which 
    are the insulated wires that carry electrical impulses from the IPG to the 
    heart. 

    In March 1994, Medtronic acquired substantially all assets and liabilities 
    of DLP, Inc. for approximately $128.3 million in cash. DLP is the market 
    leader in the development, manufacture, and sale of cannula products used 
    in heart surgery. Other DLP products are used in marking and targeting 
    suspected malignancies during diagnostic and interventional procedures. 
    DLP will operate as part of the company's Cardiac Surgery business. 

    In April 1994, Medtronic acquired all of the outstanding common stock of 
    Electromedics, Inc. for approximately $95.3 million. The purchase price 
    consisted of approximately $39.1 million payable in cash and approximately 
    778,000 shares of common stock valued at $56.2 million. Electromedics 
    designs, manufactures and markets blood management and blood conservation 
    equipment for use in autotransfusion, or retransfusion of a patient's own 
    blood, during major medical procedures. Electromedics will operate as part 
    of the company's Cardiac Surgery business. 

    In April 1994, Medtronic also acquired all of the remaining outstanding 
    common stock of Carbon Implants, Inc. Carbon Implants is an innovator in 
    pyrolytic carbon coating processes and the design and manufacture of 
    mechanical heart valves using these processes for enhanced durability and 
    biocompatibility. The total purchase price was approximately $34.6 million 
    in cash. 

    In July 1993, Medtronic sold substantially all the assets of its Medtronic 
    Andover Medical, Inc. ("AMI") subsidiary. AMI manufactured electrodes, 
    cables and related devices for the neurological and cardiovascular 
    markets. Annual sales of AMI were approximately $23 million. Medtronic has 
    now completed its recent strategy to divest businesses that do not 
    directly support its core implantable and invasive medical technology 
    businesses. 

    Medtronic operates in a single industry segment, that of providing 
    products for medical applications. Its revenues, operating profits and 
    assets for the past three fiscal years (1992-1994) have been attributable 
    to this single industry segment. 

    BUSINESS NARRATIVE. 
    Medtronic generally has vertically integrated manufacturing operations, 
    and makes its own lithium batteries, feedthroughs, integrated and hybrid 
    circuits, and certain other components. Sales of pacemaker and 
    tachyarrhythmia management products, such as IPGs, the implantable 
    pacer/cardioverter/defibrillator ("PCD(R)") device, leads and 
    instrumentation accounted for 67.2% of Medtronic's net sales during the 
    fiscal year ended April 30, 1994 ("fiscal 1994"), 65.7% of net sales in 
    fiscal 1993 and 66.1% of net sales in fiscal 1992. 

    Medtronic produces various models of brady pacemakers and leads. These 
    include pacemakers which can be noninvasively programmed by the physician 
    to adjust sensing, electrical pulse intensity, duration, rate, and other 
    characteristics, as well as pacemakers which can sense in both the upper 
    and lower chambers of the heart and produce impulses to cause upper or 
    lower chamber contractions, or both, in appropriate relation to heart 
    activity. Medtronic produces LEGEND II(R) and ELITE II(R) pacemakers, 
    which are rate variable in response to patient activity levels. LEGEND 
    II(R) and ELITE II(R) models currently account for a substantial portion 
    of Medtronic's U.S. and international single chamber and dual chamber 
    pacemaker product sales, respectively. The Thera(R) pacing system, 
    consisting of a new line of pulse generators, a new specialized lead and a 
    new model 9790 programmer which can be used with all brady pacing products 
    as well as the Jewel(tm) family of PCD(R) devices, was commercially 
    released outside the U.S. in March 1994, and the pulse generators are in 
    clinical evaluation in the U.S. In addition to the "Medtronic" line of 
    pacemakers, the company also produces a separate line of IPGs and leads 
    under the brand name "Vitatron." 
    
    The Pacing business also produces the PCD(R), an implantable device for 
    treating ventricular tachyarrhythmias using a tiered therapy of pacing, 
    cardioversion and defibrillation. In December 1993, the Transvene(R) lead 
    system was commercially introduced in the U.S. This transvenous lead 
    system allows the PCD(R) device to be implanted without a thoracotomy, 
    thereby reducing patient trauma and hospitalization time. Medtronic's 
    Transvene(R) leads and the PCD(R) comprise the first complete transvenous, 
    tiered therapy system to be cleared by the FDA in the United States. 

    The next generation of tachyarrhythmia devices is the Jewel(TM) family, 
    which is designed to be implanted in the chest rather than the abdomen. 
    The Jewel(TM) PCD(R) implantable defibrillator, which allows shorter 
    implant procedures and reduced hospital stays, was commercially released 
    outside the U.S. in December 1993 and has been in clinical evaluation in 
    the U.S. since September 1993. 

    Medtronic's products, other than brady pacing and tachyarrhythmia 
    management products, accounted for the following percentages of its net 
    sales in fiscal 1994: other cardiovascular products, which include heart 
    valves, oxygenators, blood pumps, angioplasty catheters and other related 
    cardiovascular products, 23.6% (22.9% for fiscal 1993 and 21.4% for fiscal 
    1992); and neurological and other businesses, which include implantable 
    neurostimulation devices, drug administration systems, and venture-related 
    products, 9.2% (11.4% for fiscal 1993 and 12.5% for fiscal 1992). The 
    decrease in percentage of revenue contributed by neurological and other 
    businesses is due to divested product lines during fiscal 1993 and 1994. 

    GOVERNMENT REGULATION. 
    The industry segment in which Medtronic competes involves development, 
    production and sales of medical devices. In the United States, the FDA, 
    among other governmental agencies, is responsible for regulating the 
    introduction of new medical devices, laboratory and manufacturing 
    practices, and labeling and recordkeeping for medical devices, as well as 
    for reviewing manufacturers' required reports of adverse experience to 
    identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. The FDA can ban 
    certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical 
    devices and order repair, replacement, or refund, and require notification 
    of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that 
    present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The 
    FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the Food, Drug and 
    Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical 
    devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. 
    Many of the devices that Medtronic develops and markets are in a category 
    for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and 
    premarket clearance requirements. Moreover, the FDA administers certain 
    controls over the export of such devices from the United States. 

    The number of medical devices approved by the FDA for commercial release 
    has decreased significantly in recent years due to more rigorous clinical 
    evaluation requirements, increased enforcement actions, and enactment of 
    the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, which reflect a trend toward more 
    stringent product regulation by the FDA. Rigorous regulatory action may be 
    taken in response to deficiencies noted in inspections or to any product 
    performance problems. The risks in the United States of lengthened 
    introduction times for new products and additional expense have increased 
    substantially. In addition, the requirements for post-market surveillance 
    and device tracking under the Safe Medical Devices Act will continue to 
    increase the expense of the regulatory process. 

    Medical device laws are also in effect in many of the countries in which 
    Medtronic does business outside the United States. These range from 
    comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of Medtronic's 
    medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. 
    The number and scope of these requirements is increasing. This trend 
    toward increasing product regulation is evident in the European Economic 
    Community, where efforts are underway to harmonize the regulatory systems. 

    President Clinton's administration has introduced a health care reform 
    bill that would cause significant changes in health care delivery. 
    Congress is currently considering this bill and others, and it is 
    generally expected that Congress will pass a health care reform bill in 
    some form which could affect health care expenditures in the United 
    States. Similar initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, 
    including price regulation, are also underway in several other countries 
    in which the company does business. These changes are causing the 
    marketplace to place increased emphasis on the delivery of more 
    cost-effective medical therapies. Although the company believes it is well 
    positioned to respond to changes resulting from health care reform, the 
    uncertainty as to the outcome of any proposed legislation or change in the 
    marketplace precludes the company from predicting the impact such reform 
    may have on future operating results. 

    The U.S. Health Care Financing Agency, which determines Medicare 
    reimbursement policy and practice, appears to be changing its practice of 
    reimbursing hospitals for procedures involving medical devices in clinical 
    evaluation. Such a change in practice is causing some hospitals to treat 
    Medicare patients only with medical devices that have been cleared for 
    commercial release by the FDA. This action will probably limit the scope 
    of clinical trials in the U.S., force more clinical research to non-U.S. 
    markets and increase the cost and time required to complete clinical 
    evaluations in the U.S. 

    Medtronic is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
    both in the United States and abroad. The operations of the company, like 
    those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances 
    regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and 
    sterilization processes. In addition, many of these substances contain 
    chlorofluorocarbons which, under federal law, must be phased out in the 
    mid-1990s. Medtronic believes that alternatives are available and plans to 
    eliminate the use of chlorofluorocarbons in compliance with such 
    requirements. While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of 
    compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that 
    such compliance will not have a material impact on the company's financial 
    position. 

    SALES, MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION METHODS. 
    The primary markets for Medtronic's products are hospitals, other medical 
    institutions and physicians, both in the United States and abroad. No one 
    customer individually accounts for a material amount of Medtronic's total 
    sales. 

    Medtronic sells most of its products and services directly through its 
    staff of trained, full-time sales representatives. Sales by these 
    representatives accounted for approximately 94.5% of Medtronic's U.S. 
    sales and approximately 61.7% of its sales from other countries in fiscal 
    1994. The remaining sales were made through independent distributors. 
    Medtronic maintains inventories of its high volume sales products in 
    various locations in the United States and in the rest of the world. 

    NEW PRODUCTS. 
    New products recently introduced by Medtronic include, in part, the 
    following: (i) the Thera(TM) pacing system, consisting of a new line of 
    pulse generators, a new specialized lead and a new 9790 programmer which 
    can be used with all brady pacing products as well as the Jewel(TM) family

    Maxima Plus(TM) membrane oxygenator received clearance for commercial 
    release in the U.S. in February 1994. 

    RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION. 
    Medtronic purchases many of the parts and materials used in manufacturing 
    its products from external suppliers and internally manufactures certain 
    of its product components. Medtronic's single- and sole-sourced materials 
    include medical adhesives and resins, certain integrated circuits, power 
    sources, switches, sensors, crystals, polyurethane, silicone rubber, 
    certain electrolytic capacitors, pyrolytic carbon discs, Lioresal(R)* 
    (baclofen, USP) Intrathecal, computer and other peripheral equipment, 
    cable connector assemblies, MP-35N wire, and drawn-brazed stranded wire. 
    Medtronic believes that its suppliers of polyurethane and medical adhesive 
    are the sole U. S. suppliers of such materials. The other noted parts and 
    materials are purchased from single sources for reasons of quality 
    assurance and cost effectiveness. Medtronic works closely with its 
    suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality 
    and reliability. However, the medical device industry was recently advised 
    that, in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure, certain 
    suppliers have terminated or are planning to terminate sales of certain 
    materials and parts to customers that manufacture implantable medical 
    devices. Medtronic believes that various design, material or supplier 
    alternatives can be found for these materials and components without a 
    significant interruption in production.

    PATENTS AND LICENSES. 
    Medtronic owns patents on certain of its inventions, and obtains licenses 
    from others as it deems necessary to its business. Medtronic's policy is 
    to obtain patents on its inventions whenever practical. Technological 
    advancement has been characteristically rapid in the industry in which 
    Medtronic competes, and Medtronic does not consider its business to be 
    materially dependent upon any individual patent. 

    COMPETITION AND INDUSTRY. 
    Medtronic sells therapeutic medical devices in the United States and 
    throughout the world. In the businesses in which Medtronic competes, the 
    company faces a mixture of competitors ranging from large multi-national 
    industrial manufacturers to diversified pharmaceutical companies, as well 
    as regional or national manufacturers that offer a limited number of 
    products. Important factors to Medtronic's customers include product 
    reliability and performance, product technology that provides for improved 
    patient benefits, product price, and related product services provided by 
    the manufacturer. Major shifts in industry market shares have occurred in 
    connection with product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, 
    reflecting the importance and risks of product quality in the medical 
    device industry. 

Medtronic is the leading manufacturer and supplier of brady pacemakers in 
both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. Worldwide, approximately ten 
manufacturers compete in the pacemaker industry. In the U.S., Medtronic and 
four other manufacturers account for a significant portion of pacemaker 
sales. Medtronic and five other manufacturers account for most of the 
non-U.S. pacemaker sales. 

In the tachyarrhythmia management device market, Medtronic and two other 
manufacturers based in the U.S. account for most sales of implantable 
defibrillators within and outside the U.S. Medtronic and one of these other 
manufacturers has a transvenous lead system cleared for commercial sale in 
the U.S. Medtronic's PCD(R) device is commercially available with the 
company's Transvene(TM) leads in U.S. and non-U.S. markets. Five other 
companies have devices in various stages of development and clinical 
evaluation. 

In the angioplasty device market, including balloon and guiding catheters 
used in coronary artery procedures, there are numerous competitors worldwide. 
Four competitors based in the United States account for a significant portion 
of sales of angioplasty devices both in the United States and abroad. 

Medtronic is the second largest manufacturer and supplier of tissue heart 
valves and also of mechanical heart valves within and outside the U.S. 
Another large manufacturer and distributor of hospital products and services 
is the major competitor in tissue heart valves and another company is the 
major competitor in mechanical heart valves. These two companies and 
Medtronic are the primary manufacturers and suppliers of heart valves within 
the U.S. These three companies plus a few competitors outside the U.S. 
account for most of the non-U.S. heart valve sales. 

In the blood oxygenator market, there are approximately seven companies that 
account for a significant portion of the U. S. and non-U.S. markets. 
Medtronic believes it is the largest manufacturer and supplier of blood 
oxygenators worldwide. Medtronic is the leading manufacturer of centrifugal 
blood pumps worldwide. 

Medtronic recently entered the cannula market with the acquisition of DLP, 
Inc., the market leader in cannula products. See "General Development of 
Business" above. Medtronic and four competitors account for a significant 
portion of cannulae sales in the U.S. 

Medtronic recently entered the autotransfusion market with the acquisition of 
Electromedics, Inc. See "General Development of Business" above. Medtronic 
and three competitors account for a significant portion of autotransfusion 
sales in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. 

In neurological devices, Medtronic is the leading manufacturer and supplier 
of implantable neurostimulation systems. There are a few competitors 
worldwide. Medtronic and one competitor account for most worldwide sales of 
implantable drug delivery systems. 

Market complexity has been intensifying in the medical device industry in 
recent years. Factors such as relative patent portfolios, government 
regulation, including the regulatory approval process for medical devices, a 
more rigorous enforcement climate at the FDA, anticipated significant health 
care reform, government reimbursement systems for health care costs, product 
liability litigation and the rapid rate of technological change are 
increasingly important considerations for existing medical device 
manufacturers and any potential entrants to the industry. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. 
Medtronic spent $156.3 million on research and development (11.2% of net 
sales) in fiscal 1994, $133.0 million (10.0% of net sales) in fiscal 1993 
and $109.2 million (9.3% of net sales) in fiscal 1992. Such amounts have 
been applied toward improving existing products, expanding their 
applications, and developing new products. Medtronic's present research 
and development projects span such areas as sensing and treatment of 
cardiovascular disorders (including bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia, 
fibrillation, and sinus node abnormalities); improved heart valves, 
membrane oxygenators and centrifugal blood pump systems; implantable drug 
delivery systems for pain and other neurological applications; muscle and 
neurological stimulators; therapeutic catheters; coronary stents and 
treatments for restenosis; implantable physiologic sensors; cardiac assist 
systems (cardiomyoplasty) and other applications of transformed muscle; 
and materials and coatings to enhance blood and device interface. 

Medtronic has not engaged in significant customer or government sponsored 
research. 

EMPLOYEES. 
On April 30, 1994, Medtronic and its subsidiaries employed 8,709 persons 
on a regular, full-time basis and, including temporary and part-time 
employees, a total of 9,856 employees on a full-time equivalent basis. 

U.S. AND NON-U.S. OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES. 
Medtronic sells products in the following markets: United States, Canada, 
Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Japan and other Asia/Pacific. 
For financial reporting purposes, the revenues, profitability, and 
identifiable assets attributable to significant geographic areas are 
presented in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, 
incorporated herein by reference to Medtronic's 1994 Annual Shareholder 
Report on page 51. U.S. export sales to unaffiliated customers comprised 
less than one percent of Medtronic's consolidated sales in each of fiscal 
1994, 1993 and 1992. 

Operation in countries outside the U.S. is accompanied by certain 
financial and other risks. Relationships with customers and effective 
terms of sale frequently vary by country, often with longer-term 
receivables than are typical in the U.S. Inventory management is an 
important business concern due to the potential for rapidly changing 
business conditions and currency exposure. Currency exchange rate 
fluctuations can affect income from, and profitability of, non-U.S. 
operations. Medtronic attempts to hedge these exposures to reduce the 
effects on net earnings of foreign currency fluctuations. Certain 
countries also limit or regulate the repatriation of earnings to the 
United States. Non-U.S. operations in general present complex tax and 
money management questions requiring sophisticated analysis and precise 
execution of strategy to meet the company's financial objectives.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SUMMARY

Medtronic  is  the  world's  leading  therapeutic  medical  technology  company,
developing,  manufacturing, and marketing therapies for improving cardiovascular
and neurological health.  Primary products include implantable pacemaker systems
used for the treatment of bradycardia,  implantable  tachyarrhythmia  management
systems,  mechanical and tissue heart valves, balloon and guiding catheters used
in angioplasty,  implantable  neurostimulation  and drug delivery  systems,  and
perfusion  systems  including  blood   oxygenators,   centrifugal  blood  pumps,
autotransfusion systems, and cannula products.

Significant events during the company's fiscal year included several new product
introductions and three  acquisitions.  In December 1993, the United States Food
and Drug  Administration  (FDA) cleared the company's  Transvene lead system for
use  with  the  Medtronic  implantable   pacer/cardioverter/defibrillator  (PCD)
device.  In March  1994,  two  devices  in the new Jewel PCD  product  line were
commercially  released outside the United States as was the company's Thera line
of bradycardia  pacemaker systems.  The company strengthened its cardiac surgery
business product line with the March acquisition of DLP, Inc., a manufacturer of
cannula and  interventional  radiology  products,  and the April acquisitions of
Electromedics,   Inc.  and  Carbon   Implants,   Inc.   Electromedics   designs,
manufactures,   and   markets   blood   conservation   equipment   for   use  in
autotransfusion during major medical procedures. Carbon Implants is an innovator
in the design and manufacturing of implantable prosthetic heart valves.

Operating  results for 1994 are  highlighted  by the ninth  consecutive  year of
growth in net sales ($1.4 billion),  net earnings ($232.4 million), and earnings
per share ($4.05).  Net sales in 1994  increased  11.3% over the prior year on a
comparable   operations  basis  (i.e.,   after  adjusting  for  the  effects  of
acquisitions and divestitures  discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements and foreign currency translations), compared to increases of 13.0% in
1993 and 13.6% in 1992.  The increase in net sales  results from another year of
strong  growth  in  all  three  of  the  company's  businesses:   pacing,  other
cardiovascular,  and  neurological  and other.  Net earnings  increased 17.8% in
1994,  compared with increases of 22.1% in 1993 and 21.1% in 1992.  Earnings per
share  increased  22.0% in 1994,  compared  with  increases of 22.5% in 1993 and
20.4% in 1992.


NET SALES

The  following  is a summary of sales by business as a  percentage  of total net
sales:

tachyarrhythmia  management, increased 12.0% over the prior year on a comparable
operations  basis.  Sales of both  tachyarrhythmia  management  and  bradycardia
devices grew  significantly  in 1994.  Sales growth  within the  tachyarrhythmia
management  business was attributable to the U.S.  commercial release of the PCD
device in February 1993 and U.S. commercial release of the Transvene lead system
in December 1993. The FDA approval of the Transvene lead system  established the
company's PCD system as the first  tiered-therapy  transvenous   tachyarrhythmia
system  cleared for implant in the United  States.  The new,  smaller  Jewel PCD
devices,  commercially released in markets outside the United States in December
1993 and in  clinical  evaluation  in the United  States,  also  contributed  to
tachyarrhythmia revenue growth.  Bradycardia pacing net sales surpassed the rate
of market growth led by the Elite II  dual-chamber  rate  responsive  pacemaker,
market  released in the United States in December 1992, and the company's  broad
line of CapSure leads.

Also  contributing  to the  bradycardia  sales  growth  was the Thera  pacemaker
system,  consisting of a family of six new  pacemakers,  a specialized new lead,
and a new programmer, which was commercially released in Europe in March 1994.

Net sales of the other cardiovascular  business,  consisting of cardiopulmonary,
heart  valves,  and  interventional  vascular,  increased  8.4% on a  comparable
operations basis in 1994. The  interventional  vascular business reported strong
double digit sales growth  stemming from an increase in worldwide  unit sales of
the  14K  and  Spirit   over-the-wire   balloon   catheters   and  Gold  Xchange
rapid-exchange catheter. The overall increase in unit growth was slightly offset
by declining  average  selling  prices.  The decrease in selling  prices was the
result of  increasing  price  competition  and it is  anticipated  that  further
erosion of selling  prices will continue into 1995.  Within the  cardiopulmonary
and heart valves  businesses,  centrifugal blood pumps and bioprosthetic  tissue
valves contributed solid revenue growth. A moderation in the growth rate of open
heart  surgeries  slowed  the  overall  sales  growth  of the heart  valves  and
cardiopulmonary   businesses.   With  the  recent  acquisitions  of  DLP,  Inc.,
Electromedics,  Inc., and Carbon Implants, Inc., management believes the company
is well positioned for future growth in the cardiac surgery market.

On a  comparable  operations  basis,  net  sales of the  neurological  and other
businesses,  primarily consisting of implantable  neurostimulation devices, drug
administration systems, and components, grew 14.5% over the previous year. These
results  reflect strong growth in sales of the implantable  SynchroMed  infusion
system,  which  received  clearance  from  the FDA in  August  1992 for use with
Lioresal(R) Intrathecal for the treatment of chronic spasticity and morphine for
malignant pain. In February 1994, the U.S. Health Care Financing  Administration
authorized Medicare  reimbursement for use of the SynchroMed system in treatment
of these indications. The neurological and other businesses sales have decreased
as a percentage  of total sales in 1994 because of the  divestitures  of certain
product lines within this business.

As part of its overall  growth  strategy,  the company is  continuing  to pursue
opportunities  that address  unmet patient needs in areas where there is synergy
with current businesses.  Currently,  these opportunities include, among others,
treatment of  congestive  heart failure and voiding  dysfunctions.  Net sales of
products from venture-related activities, included in the neurological and other
business, were not material in each of the three years ended 1994.

In 1994, U.S. sales increased  10.9%,  excluding the effects of acquisitions and
divestitures.  Sales outside the United States  increased  11.9% on a comparable
operations basis. Sales in non-U.S. markets accounted for 42.5% of worldwide net
sales,  compared  with 42.0% in 1993 and 40.6% in 1992.  However,  the impact of
foreign currency  fluctuations on net sales affects  comparisons  between years.
Net sales growth in 1994 was affected by $30.8  million of  unfavorable  foreign
exchange rate movements  caused by the U.S. dollar  strengthening  against major
foreign currencies. Conversely, comparing 1993 to 1992, net sales were increased
by $22.0  million from the effect of the U.S.  dollar  weakening  against  major
foreign   currencies.   When  adjusted  for  the  impact  of  foreign   exchange
fluctuations  to the respective  prior year, net sales in non-U.S.  markets as a
percent of worldwide net sales were 43.7% in 1994,  41.0% in 1993,  and 41.5% in
1992.  The  impact  of  foreign   currency   fluctuations  on  net  earnings  is
significantly  less  than the  impact  on sales  due to the  offsetting  foreign
currency impact on costs and expenses and the company's hedging activities.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

The  following is a summary of major costs and  expenses as a percentage  of net
sales:

Years ended April 30,                1994             1993            1992

Cost of Products Sold                31.0%            31.6%           32.4%
Research & Development               11.2             10.0             9.3
Selling, General & Administrative    33.8             36.1            37.4

The  improvement  in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 1994 was
primarily  the  result  of the  divestitures  of  lower  margin  product  lines,
productivity increases,  and effective cost controls. The efficiencies of higher
production   levels   were   evident   in  most   businesses,   especially   for
tachyarrhythmia    management,   drug   administration   system   devices,   and
interventional  vascular  products.  Future  gross  margins  will be impacted by
regulatory and competitive  pricing pressures,  recently acquired product lines,
new  product  introductions,  the  mix  of  products  both  within  and  between
businesses,  productivity  fluctuations,  and the  effects of  foreign  currency
fluctuations.

The increase in research and  development  (R&D) expense  reflects the company's
strategy and commitment to invest significant  resources to increase revenue and
market share by developing  technological  enhancements  and new indications for
existing  products  as well as  developing  new  technologies  to address  unmet
patient needs. R&D expense increased 17.6% to $156.3 million in 1994 from $133.0
million in 1993.

The decline in selling,  general, and administrative  expense (SG&A) in 1994 was
caused by the divestitures in 1993 and 1994,  effective spending  controls,  and
increased  royalty  income.  SG&A  expense  in 1994 was also  affected  by $14.3
million of charges  which  primarily  relate to the impact of  adoption of a new
accounting  principle and a provision for  potentially  uncollectible  trade and
other receivables.

Interest  expense was $8.2 million in 1994,  compared with $10.4 million in 1993
and $13.4 million in 1992.  Interest  income was $8.4 million in 1994,  compared
with $8.8  million  in 1993 and  $10.3  million  in 1992.  Interest  income  and
interest  expense in 1994 are lower than in 1993 primarily due to the redemption
of Industrial  Development Serial Revenue Bonds early in 1994 and lower interest
rates paid on bank borrowings and earned on investments.

In July 1993,  the company sold  substantially  all of the assets of its Andover
Medical, Inc., subsidiary for $21.0 million,  recognizing a pretax gain of $14.0
million.  Andover  Medical  developed,   manufactured,   and  marketed  external
electrodes used primarily with electrical  nerve  stimulation and  neuromuscular
stimulation devices.


INCOME TAXES

The  effective  income tax rate in 1994 was 33.0%,  compared with 32.5% in 1993,
and 33.5% in 1992.  The increase in 1994 was primarily the result of an increase
in the U.S.  income tax rate.  The decrease in 1993 was  primarily the result of
adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," and lower income taxes in certain non-U.S. locations.

Federal tax  legislation  has been passed  which  increases  the U.S.  corporate
income tax rate, retroactively reinstates the research tax credit, and beginning
in 1995,  limits U.S. tax benefits from  operations in Puerto Rico. The increase
in the  federal  tax rate and Puerto Rico  benefit  limitations  will put upward
pressure  on the  company's  effective  tax rate.  However,  the impact of these
factors on the  effective  tax rate in future years will be primarily  dependent
upon the  level of  operating  activity  in Puerto  Rico and  level of  research
activities.  Accordingly,  the  company  cannot  determine  the  impact  the tax
legislation will have on future operating results. For further  discussion,  see
Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SUMMARY

At April 30, 1994, cash and cash  equivalents were $108.7 million and short-term
investments were $72.7 million, compared with $77.0 million and $79.0 million at
April 30, 1993, respectively.  The company continued to maintain a high level of
working  capital,  the excess of current  assets over  current  liabilities,  at
$406.4  million at April 30,  1994,  compared  with $426.6  million at April 30,
1993.  The current ratio at April 30, 1994,  was 1.9:1,  compared with 2.2:1 and
2.3:1 at April 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The decrease in working capital
and  current  ratio is  primarily  due to an  increase  in  current  liabilities
resulting from acquisitions near year-end and the timing of estimated income tax
payments.  The company's  net cash  position,  defined as the sum of cash,  cash
equivalents, and short-term investments less short-term borrowings and long-term
debt was $103.0  million at April 30, 1994,  compared to $53.3  million and 21.2
million at April 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.


CASH FLOW

Cash provided by operating  activities was $356.9 million,  compared with $291.5
million in 1993 and $151.4  million in 1992.  The  company's  cash  position was
favorably impacted by the timing of income tax payments, ongoing royalty income,
and decreases in prepaid  expenses and other current  assets offset by increases
in accounts receivable and inventories.

During 1994, the cash portion of the purchase price paid for the acquisitions of
DLP,  Electromedics,   Inc.,  Carbon  Implants,  Inc.,  and  CardioRhythm,   was
approximately   $189.4  million.   For  further  details,  see  Note  2  to  the
consolidated  financial  statements.  In addition to  acquisitions,  significant
items  affecting  cash flows during 1994 included  repurchases  of the company's
common stock and additions to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). The cost of
stock  repurchases  in 1994 were $53.4  million,  compared to $142.9 million and
$38.3  million  in 1993  and  1992,  respectively.  Additions  to  PP&E,  net of
retirements and additions  associated with newly acquired  entities,  were $60.8
million in 1994,  compared with $77.1 million in 1993 and $77.2 million in 1992.
The  company   expects   growth  in  capital   spending  to  support   increased
manufacturing  capacity and  operational  requirements.  This  spending  will be
financed primarily by funds from operations.


DEBT AND CAPITAL

During 1993,  the Board of Directors  authorized  the company to  repurchase  an
additional 3.0 million  shares of its common stock,  of which  authorization  to
repurchase  approximately  1.5  million  shares  remained  at  April  30,  1994.
Approximately 860,000 shares were repurchased in 1994 at a cost of $53.4 million
(average price,  $62.16 per share),  financed in part by short-term  borrowings.
The company  repurchased  shares in 1994 to offset  dilution  resulting from the
issuance of stock under  employee  benefit plans and to take advantage of market
conditions.   Future  repurchases  of  common  stock  will  depend  upon  market
conditions,  the company's  cash  position,  and other  factors.  In April 1994,
approximately  778,000 shares of common stock were issued for the acquisition of
Electromedics.  For further details,  see Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial
statements.

Dividends to shareholders were $39.0 million,  $33.3 million,  and $29.3 million
in 1994, 1993, and 1992,  respectively.  Consistent with the company's financial
objectives,  the  company  expects to  continue  paying  dividends  at a rate of
approximately 20% of the previous year's net earnings.

The company's capital structure  consists of equity and  interest-bearing  debt.
The  company  utilizes  long-term  debt  minimally.  Interest-bearing  debt as a
percent of total  capital was 6.9% at April 30,  1994,  compared  with 10.9% and
10.1% at April 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively. These ratios are well within the
company's financial  objective of maintaining a debt-to-total  capital ratio not
exceeding 30%.

Return on equity  (ROE),  which  compares net earnings to average  shareholders'
equity,  is a key measure of management's  ability to utilize the  shareholders'
investment in the company  effectively.  Achieving ROE of at least 20% per year,
one of the  company's  financial  objectives,  was again  exceeded in 1994.  The
company  continued its strong  performance  with ROE of 24.5% in 1994,  compared
with 24.1% in 1993 and 21.8% in 1992.


GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND OTHER MATTERS

President Clinton's Administration has introduced a health care reform bill that
would cause significant  changes in health care delivery.  Congress is currently
considering  this bill and others,  and it is generally  expected  that Congress
will pass a health care reform bill in some form which could affect  health care
expenditures  in the United States.  Similar  initiatives to limit the growth of
health care costs,  including  price  regulation,  are also  underway in several
other  countries in which the company does  business.  These changes are causing
the   marketplace  to  place   increased   emphasis  on  the  delivery  of  more
cost-effective  medical  therapies.  Although  the  company  believes it is well
positioned  to  respond  to changes  resulting  from  health  care  reform,  the
uncertainty  as to the  outcome  of any  proposed  legislation  or change in the
marketplace  precludes  the company from  predicting  the impact such reform may
have on future operating results.

The number of medical  devices  approved by the FDA for  commercial  release has
decreased significantly in recent years due to more rigorous clinical evaluation
requirements,  increased  enforcement  actions,  and the  enactment  of the Safe
Medical Devices Act of 1990, which reflect a trend toward more stringent product
regulation by the FDA.  Rigorous  regulatory  action may be taken in response to
deficiencies noted in inspections or to any product  performance  problems.  The
risks in the United States of lengthened introduction times for new products and
additional expense have increased  substantially.  In addition, the requirements
for post-market  surveillance and device tracking under the Safe Medical Devices
Act continue to increase the expense of the regulatory process.

The U.S. Health Care Financing Agency,  which determines Medicare  reimbursement
policy  and  practice,  appears  to be  changing  its  practice  of  reimbursing
hospitals for procedures involving medical devices in clinical evaluation.  Such
a change in practice is causing some hospitals to treat  Medicare  patients only
with medical  devices that have been cleared for commercial  release by the FDA.
This  action  will  probably  limit the scope of  clinical  trials in the United
States, force more clinical research to non-U.S.  markets, and increase the cost
and time required to complete clinical evaluations in the United States.

The  operations of the company,  like those of other medical  device  companies,
involve the use of substances  regulated under environmental laws,  primarily in
manufacturing and sterilization processes. In addition, many of these substances
contain  chlorofluorocarbons which, under federal law, must be phased out in the
mid-1990s.  Medtronic  believes  that  alternatives  are  available and plans to
eliminate the use of  chlorofluorocarbons  in compliance with such requirements.
While it is  difficult  to quantify  the  potential  impact of  compliance  with
environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not
have a material impact on the company's financial position.

The company operates in an industry susceptible to significant product liability
claims.  Product  liability  claims may be  asserted  against the company in the
future  relative  to events not known to  management  at the present  time.  The
company has insurance coverage which management  believes is adequate to protect
against any material product liability losses.

The  management of  Medtronic,  Inc.,  is  responsible  for the integrity of the
financial information presented in the annual report. The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  Where  necessary,  they  reflect  estimates  based on  management's
judgment.

Management relies upon established  accounting procedures and related systems of
internal control for meeting its responsibilities to maintain reliable financial
records.  These systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets
are  safeguarded  and that  transactions  are properly  recorded and executed in
accordance with management's  intentions.  Internal auditors periodically review
the  accounting and control  systems,  and these systems are revised if and when
weaknesses or deficiencies are found.

The Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors,  composed  of  directors  from
outside the company,  meets regularly with  management,  the company's  internal
auditors,  and its  independent  accountants to discuss audit scope and results,
internal control  evaluations,  and other accounting,  reporting,  and financial
matters.  The independent  accountants and internal  auditors have access to the
Audit Committee without management's presence.

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of Medtronic, Inc.

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet and the related
consolidated  statements  of earnings and of cash flows present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,   the  financial  position  of  Medtronic,   Inc.,  and  its
subsidiaries at April 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 1994,
in conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   company's   management;   our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We conducted  our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material  misstatement.  An audit includes  examining,  on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  and evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe  that our audits  provide a reasonable  basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(in thousands of dollars, except per share data)                 Medtronic, Inc.

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic,  Inc.,
and all of its  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions  and
accounts  have  been   eliminated.   Certain  prior  period  amounts  have  been
reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The company considers temporary cash investments with maturities of three months
or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a
first-in, first-out basis.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements are
capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Depreciation is
provided using the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives of the
various assets.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill  represents the excess of cost over net assets of businesses  acquired,
while other  intangible  assets  consist  primarily of purchased  technology and
patents.  These assets are being amortized using the  straight-line  method over
their estimated useful lives, of which periods up to 26 years remain.

The  increases in goodwill and other  intangible  assets during 1994 are related
primarily to the  acquisitions of DLP, Inc.,  Electromedics,   Inc.,  and Carbon
Implants, Inc. See Note 2 for discussion of acquisitions.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Essentially  all  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  to U.S.  dollars at
year-end  exchange rates,  while elements of the income statement are translated
at average  exchange rates in effect during the year.  Adjustments  arising from
the  translation  of most net  assets  located  outside  the  United  States are
recorded as a component of shareholders' equity.

ROYALTY INCOME

Income earned from royalty and license  agreements is recorded as a reduction of
selling, general, and administrative expense.


NOTE 2--ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

ACQUISITIONS

On March 17,  1994,  the company  acquired  substantially  all of the assets and
liabilities of DLP, Inc., for  approximately  $128.3 million in cash. DLP is the
market leader in the development, manufacture, and sale of cannula products used
in heart surgery.

On April  25,  1994,  the  company  acquired  all of the  outstanding  shares of
Electromedics,  Inc.,  for  approximately  $95.3  million.  The  purchase  price
consisted  of  approximately  $39.1  million  payable in cash and  approximately
778,000  shares  of  the  company's   common  stock  valued  at  $56.2  million.
Electromedics  designs,  manufactures,  and markets blood  management  and blood
conservation   equipment  for  use  in  autotransfusion   during  major  medical
procedures.

On April 29, 1994, the company acquired all of the remaining  outstanding common
stock of Carbon Implants,  Inc., an innovator in the design and manufacturing of
implantable  prosthetic heart valves. The total purchase price was approximately
$34.6 million.

The acquisitions of DLP,  Electromedics,  and Carbon Implants were accounted for
as purchases.  Accordingly,  the results of operations of the acquired  entities
have been included in the company's  consolidated financial statements since the
respective dates of acquisition.  Acquired goodwill,  patents,  trademarks,  and
other intangible assets  associated with these  acquisitions are being amortized
using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 8 to 25 years.

The following  unaudited pro forma  information has been prepared  assuming that
the acquisitions of DLP, Electromedics,  and Carbon Implants had occurred at the
beginning of the periods presented. Permitted pro forma adjustments include only
the effects of events directly  attributable to a transaction that are factually
supportable and expected to have a continuing impact,  such as:  amortization of
intangibles, decreased net interest income on cash paid, income tax effects, and
increased  outstanding shares of common stock. Pro forma adjustments  reflecting
anticipated  "efficiencies"  in operations  resulting from a transaction are not
permitted.  As a result of the  limitations  imposed with regard to the types of
permitted pro forma  adjustments,  Medtronic  believes  that this  unaudited pro
forma  information is not  indicative of future  results of operations,  nor the
results of historical operations had the acquisitions been consummated as of the
assumed dates.

* Net earnings and net earnings per share for 1993 exclude the cumulative effect

In May 1992,  the  company  acquired  all of the  outstanding  capital  stock of
CardioRhythm,  a  manufacturer  of  electrophysiological  catheters used for the
diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.  The initial price paid of $20.0
million was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations  have been
included in the company's  consolidated  financial  statements since the date of
acquisition.  In 1994, the company made  additional  payments of $6.5 million to
settle substantially all remaining obligations existing at the acquisition date.
These  payments  were  recorded  as  additions  to  the  initial  price  of  the
acquisition.

(in thousands of dollars, except per share data)                 Medtronic, Inc.
DIVESTITURES

In July 1993,  the  company  sold  substantially  all the assets of its  Andover
Medical, Inc., subsidiary for $21.0 million,  recognizing a pretax gain of $14.0
million.  Andover  Medical  developed,   manufactured,   and  marketed  external
electrodes used primarily with electrical  nerve  stimulation and  neuromuscular
stimulation devices. Exclusive of the gain recognized,  this transaction did not
have a significant impact on the company's operating results.

In November 1992, the company sold  substantially  all the assets of its Nortech
business, excluding accounts receivable.  Nortech developed,  manufactured,  and
marketed   transcutaneous   electrical  nerve   stimulation  and   neuromuscular
stimulation  devices for pain  control and muscle  rehabilitation.  During 1993,
intangible  asset  amortization  of $18.0  million was  recorded,  a significant
portion of which related to the Nortech business.

In February 1993,  the company sold all the assets of its  CardioCare  division.
CardioCare  was  in  the  business  of  telephonic  pacemaker  monitoring.  This
transaction  did  not  have a  significant  impact  on the  company's  operating
results.


NOTE 3--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS

A  significant  portion  of the  company's  cash  flows are  derived  from sales
denominated in foreign currencies.  To the extent the U.S. dollar value of sales
denominated in foreign  currencies is diminished as a result of a  strengthening
dollar,  the company's ability to fund dollar-based  strategic  initiatives at a
consistent  level may be impaired.  To minimize  the impact of foreign  exchange
rate movements on sales  denominated in foreign  currencies,  the company enters
into forward exchange and option contracts.  The company's hedging activities do
not  subject it to  exchange  rate risk as gains and  losses on these  financial
instruments offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions
being hedged.

The company  had  contracts  to exchange  foreign  currencies,  principally  the
Japanese Yen and German Deutschemark, for U.S. dollars as follows:

April 30,                                  1994         1993

Forward exchange contracts              $ 371,672     $112,746
Foreign currency put options               66,875      131,086

These option and forward exchange  contracts,  which typically expire within one
year, are designed to hedge  anticipated  foreign  currency  transactions.  Such
transactions,  primarily export  intercompany sales, are probable but not firmly
committed.  The  carrying  amounts of forward  contracts  are  adjusted  at each
balance  sheet date for  changes in  exchange  rates.  The  aggregate  losses on
forward  contracts of $12,869 and $11,959 in 1994 and 1993,  respectively,  were
offset by gains on the  assets,  liabilities,  and  transactions  being  hedged.
Unrealized  gains and losses on options  that are  designated  and  effective as
hedges on such  transactions  are deferred and  recognized in income in the same
period as the hedged transaction.


OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying  amounts and  estimated  fair values of the  company's  significant
financial instruments were as follows:

April 30,                     1994                 1993

                      CARRYING     FAIR    Carrying     Fair

Long-term investments   91,177   106,655     57,533     79,983
Purchased options          907       210      5,454     11,977

LIABILITIES
Short-term borrowings   55,406    55,406     86,115     86,115
Long-term debt          22,999    23,748     16,600     16,956
Forward exchange
   contracts            12,205    12,205      6,030      6,030

Fair values of  short-term  financial  instruments  approximate  their  carrying
values  due to their  short  maturity.  The fair  values  of  certain  long-term
investments are based on quoted market prices for those or similar  investments.
For  long-term  investments  which have no quoted  market  prices,  a reasonable
estimate  of  fair  value  was  made  using  available  market  information  and
appropriate valuation  techniques.  The fair value of long-term debt is based on
the current  rates  offered to the company for debt of similar  maturities.  The
estimates presented above on long-term financial instruments are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a current  market  exchange.
The fair value of foreign  currency  contracts  were  estimated  based on quoted
market prices at April 30, 1994 and 1993.

In May 1993,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial   Accounting   Standard  (SFAS)  No.  115,   "Accounting  for  Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities."  SFAS No. 115 requires certain debt
and equity securities to be accounted for based on their fair value. The company
must adopt SFAS No. 115 in 1995,  however,  adoption of SFAS 115 is not expected
to have a material impact on the company's financial position.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial  instruments,  which  potentially  subject the company to  significant
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash investments,  foreign
currency exchange contracts, and trade accounts receivable.

The company maintains cash and cash equivalents,  investments, and certain other
financial  instruments  with various major financial  institutions.  The company
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial
institutions  and  limits  the  amount of  credit  exposure  with any  financial
institution.

Concentrations  of credit risk with  respect to trade  accounts  receivable  are
limited due to the large number of customers  and their  dispersion  across many
geographic  areas. However,  a significant  amount of trade receivables are with
national health care systems in several  countries within the European  Economic
Community.  Although  the  company  does not  currently  foresee  a credit  risk
associated  with these  receivables,  repayment is dependent  upon the financial
stability of those countries' national economies.

NOTE 4--DEBT

SHORT-TERM

Short-term  borrowings consist primarily of U.S. bank borrowings used to finance
recent acquisition  activity (see Note 2 to consolidated  financial  statements)
and company stock  repurchases  and non-U.S.  bank  borrowings  used for foreign
exchange  purposes.  Short-term  borrowings and current  maturities of long-term
debt  amounted to $58,173 and $91,864 at April 30, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.
The average  interest rate of short-term  borrowings  was 5.1% and 5.3% at April
30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The company has  existing  lines of credit of $426,000  with various  banks,  of
which $370,594 was unused at April 30, 1994.  There are no compensating  balance
requirements.

LONG-TERM

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

At April 30,  1994,  Board of  Directors'  authorization  existed to  repurchase
approximately 1.5 million shares of the company's common stock.

A shareholder  rights plan exists which provides for a dividend  distribution of
one right to be attached to each share of common stock to shareholders of record
on July 10, 1991. The rights are currently not exercisable or transferable apart
from the common  stock.  The basic right  entitles  the holder to  purchase  one
two-hundredth of a share of a new series of participating preferred stock, which
is  substantially  equivalent to one share of common stock, at an exercise price
of $300 per share.  These rights would become  exercisable  if a person or group
acquires 15% or more of the  company's  common stock or announces a tender offer
which would increase the person's or group's beneficial ownership to 15% or more
of the company's common stock,  subject to certain exceptions.  After the rights
become exercisable,  each right entitles the holder, instead, to purchase common
stock having a market value of two times the exercise  price.  If the company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, each exercisable
right  entitles  the holder to purchase  common stock of the  acquiring  company
having a market value of two times the exercise  price of the right.  In certain
events the Board of Directors may exchange rights for common stock or equivalent
securities having a market price equal to the exercise price of the rights. Each
right is redeemable at $0.005 any time before a person or group triggers the 15%
ownership threshold. The rights expire on July 10, 2001.

NOTE 6--EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

The company has an  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan  (ESOP) for  eligible  U.S.
employees. In December 1989, the ESOP borrowed $40,000 from the company and used
the proceeds to purchase  1,183,308  shares of the company's  common stock.  The
company makes annual  contributions  to the plan which are used, in part, by the
ESOP to make loan and interest payments.  Expenses related to the ESOP are based
on debt  service  requirements  less any  dividends  received by the ESOP on the
company's  common  stock.  This  amount is further  adjusted  by any  additional
company  contribution  necessary  to  meet an  annual  targeted  benefit  level.
Compensation and interest expense recognized were as follows:

Total expense                   $5,797      $7,370    $5,334

Shares of common stock  acquired by the plan are  allocated to each  employee in
amounts based on company  performance  and the employee's  annual  compensation.
Allocated  shares  were  271,563  and  188,103  at  April  30,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.  Unallocated shares were 858,528 and 920,799 at April 30, 1994 and
1993,  respectively.  Unallocated  shares  are  released  based on the  ratio of
current debt service to total  remaining  debt. The loan from the company to the
ESOP is repayable over 20 years,  ending on April 30, 2010.  Interest is payable
annually  at a rate of 9.0%.  The  receivable  from the  ESOP is  recorded  as a
reduction of the company's  shareholders'  equity and allocated and  unallocated
shares of the ESOP are treated as outstanding common stock in the computation of
earnings per share.


NOTE 7--STOCK PURCHASE, OPTION, AND AWARD PLANS

The company has a stock purchase plan,  nonqualified  and incentive stock option
plans,  a  restricted  and  performance  share award  plan,  and a plan to allow
non-employee  directors to receive  restricted  stock in payment of their annual
retainer.  Issuance of the aggregate  outstanding  grants  available under these
plans would not have a material dilutive effect on reported earnings per share.


STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

The stock purchase plan enables employees to contribute up to 10% of their wages
toward  purchase  of the  company's  common  stock at 85% of the  market  value.
Employees  purchased  170,019  shares at $63.01 per share in 1994.  At April 30,
1994,  plan   participants  have  indicated  they  will  purchase  shares  worth
approximately  $8,563 at a price of $63.44 per share, or 85% of the market value
of the company's common stock at October 31, 1994, whichever is less.


STOCK OPTION PLANS

Options under a  nonqualified  stock option plan are granted to officers and key
employees at prices not less than market value at the date of grant.  There were
339,981 shares available under this plan for future grants at April 30, 1994. No
future grants will be made under this plan, if the shareholders approve the 1994
stock award plan described below.

A summary of option transactions in 1994 follows:

                          Option Price

Nonqualified options are generally  exercisable beginning one year from the date
of grant in cumulative yearly amounts of one-fourth of the shares under option.


RESTRICTED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PLAN

The restricted  stock and performance  share award plan provides for issuance of
common stock to company  officers and key  employees.  Awards are dependent upon
continued  employment  and, in the case of  performance  shares,  achievement of
certain  performance  objectives.  In 1994, 83,100 restricted shares were issued
and 46,541 performance shares were awarded.  At April 30, 1994, total restricted
shares  outstanding were 374,108 and total performance share grants  outstanding
were 116,999.  The actual number of performance shares awarded may vary from the
number of  shares  granted  depending  on the  degree  to which the  performance
objectives are met. The cost of the restricted stock is generally  expensed over
five years from the date of issuance ($4,205 in 1994, $3,763 in 1993, and $2,487
in 1992).  The estimated cost of the  performance  shares is expensed over three
years  from the date of grant  ($3,131  in 1994,  $3,387 in 1993,  and $4,999 in
1992).  There were no shares of common stock  available  for future grants under
this plan at April 30, 1994.  No future  grants will be made under this plan, if
the shareholders approve the 1994 stock award plan described below.


1994 STOCK AWARD PLAN

The Board of Directors  approved the 1994 stock award plan,  effective April 29,
1994,  to replace the  existing  stock  option,  stock award,  and  non-employee
director restricted stock plans and incorporate requirements necessary to comply
with  new  federal  tax law  requirements  for the  deductibility  of  executive
compensation.  The stock award plan provides for the grant of  nonqualified  and
incentive  stock  options,   stock  appreciation  rights,   performance  shares,
restricted stock in lieu of the annual retainer to non-employee  directors,  and
other stock-based awards.

In addition to the shares issued and  outstanding  under each of the  individual
stock option and award  plans,  the  following  awards were granted on April 29,
1994, and were outstanding as of April 30, 1994, under the new stock award

plan:  Performance  share  awards  for up to  44,924  shares,  assuming  maximum
performance  payout for the three-year  performance cycle ending April 30, 1997;
restricted  stock  awards of 1,056  shares;  and  nonqualified  options of 6,287
shares.  The 1994 grants under the stock award plan are contingent upon approval
of the plan by the  shareholders.  Assuming  shareholder  approval  of the stock
award plan,  there were 2,747,733  shares  available  under this plan for future
grants at April 30, 1994.


NOTE 8--INCOME TAXES

The company  accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. (SFAS) 109 which was adopted in 1993 on a prospective
basis.  The  asset  and  liability  approach  used  in  SFAS  109  requires  the
recognition of deferred tax assets and  liabilities  for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts and the tax
bases of other  assets  and  liabilities.  Adoption  of SFAS 109  resulted  in a
one-time charge to earnings of $5,100,  which primarily represents the impact of
adjusting  net  deferred  tax assets to reflect  current tax rates as opposed to
overall higher tax rates in effect when the net deferred tax assets originated.

The provision for income taxes is based on earnings before income taxes reported
for financial statement purposes. The components of earnings before income taxes
were:

Years ended April 30,            1994       1993      1992


United States                 $279,220    $275,047  $212,396

Earnings before income taxes  $346,801    $313,458  $242,918



The provision for income taxes consisted of:

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following:

Net deferred tax assets                   $ 63,894   $63,392



The company's  effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal  statutory
tax rate as follows:

Years ended April 30,                   1994       1993       1992


U.S. federal statutory tax rate         35.0%      34.0%      34.0%

Effective tax rate                      33.0%      32.5%      33.5%



Taxes are  provided  on  undistributed  earnings of  non-U.S.  and Puerto  Rican
subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are not permanently reinvested. Current
U.S.  tax  regulations  provide  that  earnings of the  company's  manufacturing
subsidiaries  in  Puerto  Rico  may  be  repatriated  tax  free;  however,   the
Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  will  assess a tax of up to 10% in the  event of
repatriation of earnings prior to liquidation.  The company has provided for the
anticipated tax attributable to earnings intended for dividend repatriation.  At
April 30, 1994,  earnings  permanently  reinvested in  subsidiaries  outside the
United States were $108,491. It is not practical to estimate the amount of taxes
that might be payable on these foreign earnings.

At April 30, 1994,  approximately  $9,317 of non-U.S.  tax losses were available
for carryforward. These carryforwards generally expire within a period of one to
five years.


NOTE 9--RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The company has various retirement benefit plans covering substantially all U.S.
employees and many employees outside the United States.  The cost of these plans
was $20,208 in 1994, $17,611 in 1993, and $12,007 in 1992.


DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN (UNITED STATES)

In the United States,  the company  maintains a pension plan designed to provide
guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. Plan
benefits are calculated  using a combination of years of service,  final average
earnings,  primary social security benefits, and age. It is the company's policy
to fund retirement costs within the limits of allowable tax deductions.  The net
prepaid  pension  cost was caused by  maximum  funding  during the last  several
years.  Contributions to the plan were $5,075, 

<PAGE>  48


(in thousands of dollars, except per share data)                 Medtronic, Inc.
$2,871, and $7,520 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. Plan assets consist of
a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments, equity securities, and cash
equivalents.  Plan assets include  investments in the company's  common stock of
$6,020 and $5,230 at April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Net pension cost for the U.S. plan included the following components:

Years ended April 30,            1994       1993      1992


Service cost--benefits earned during
   the year                     $5,795     $ 4,370    $3,170

Net pension cost                $4,618     $ 2,836    $1,727



The funded status of the U.S. plan was as follows:

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS (NON-U.S.)
Retirement  coverage for non-U.S.  employees of the company is provided,  to the
extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. Funding policies are based on
local statutes. Retirement benefits are based on years of service, final average
earnings, and social security benefits.

Net pension cost for the non-U.S. plans included the following components:

Years ended April 30,            1994        1993      1992


Service cost--benefits earned
   during the year              $1,374      $1,840    $1,132

Net pension cost                $1,665      $2,053    $1,310


In certain  countries,  the funding of pension plans is not a common practice as
funding  provides no  economic  benefit.  Consequently,  the company has pension
plans which are underfunded. The following table sets forth the funded status of
the non-U.S. plans:

April 30,                                    1994      1993


Actuarial present value of benefit obligation:

   Nonvested benefits                        (581)      (782)

Net accrued pension liability             $(6,632)   $(6,895)


The range of  assumptions  for the  non-U.S.  plans,  reflecting  the  different
economic environments within the various countries, were as follows:

Years ended April 30,               1994      1993     1992


Discount rate                     6.5%-8.5%   8.5%    8.5%-9.0%
Expected long-term return on assets 8.5%      8.5%      9.0%
Average increase in compensation    4.5%      5.5%    5.5%-6.0%



DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

The company has defined  contribution savings plans that cover substantially all
U.S.  employees and certain  non-U.S.  employees.  The purpose of these plans is
generally  to  provide  additional   financial  security  during  retirement  by
providing  employees  with  an  incentive  to  make  regular  savings.   Company
contributions  to the plans  are based on  employee  contributions  and  company
performance. Expense  under  the plans  was $10,402 in 1994, $9,453 in 1993, and
$8,072 in 1992.


RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS

U.S.  employees  of the company  are  currently  eligible  to receive  specified
company-paid  health care and life insurance benefits during retirement based on
their age and years of service.  The health care benefits  include  cost-sharing
features based on years of service and retirement  age. The life insurance plans
require minimum retiree contributions.

The company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 106,
"Employers'  Accounting for  Postretirement  Benefits Other Than  Pensions," for
U.S.  plans in 1993.  SFAS 106  requires  the  company to  recognize  expense as
employees earn these postretirement benefits, rather than on the cash basis. The
company chose to immediately recognize the transition  obligation,  which is the
cost of  postretirement  benefits  earned as of May 1, 1992,  by  employees  and
retirees.  This  resulted  in a one-time  charge in 1993 of  $14,930,  which was
recorded net of $5,674 in deferred income taxes.

<PAGE>  49

(in thousands of dollars, except per share data)                 Medtronic, Inc.
The net  postretirement  benefit  cost of these  U.S.  plans,  exclusive  of the
transition obligation in 1993, included the following components:

Years ended April 30,                              1994     1993


Service cost--benefits earned during the year     $1,049   $  785
Interest cost on accumulated benefit obligation    1,440    1,254
Net amortization and deferral                       (243)      --


Postretirement benefit cost                       $2,246   $2,039


The  company's  policy has been to fund the cost of these  benefits  as they are
paid.  The funded  status of the U.S.  plans at April 30, 1994 and 1993,  was as
follows:

Years ended April 30,                          1994     1993

Actuarial present value of postretirement 
  benefit obligation:

Actuarial assumptions included a discount rate of 7.5% in 1994 and 8.5% in 1993,
and an assumed  rate of increase in health care costs,  also known as the health
care cost trend  rate,  of 12% for 1994 and 1993.  This trend rate is assumed to
decrease  gradually to 6% by 2003.  Based on current  estimates,  increasing the
health care cost trend rate by one percentage point each year would increase the
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligation by $1,977 and the postretirement
benefit cost by $279.

The company must adopt SFAS 106 for non-U.S. plans by 1996. However,  management
does not  believe  adoption  of SFAS 106 for these  plans  will have a  material
impact on the company's financial position.


POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

During 1994, the company  adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) No. 112,  "Employers'  Accounting for Postemployment  Benefits." SFAS No.
112 requires the company to recognize  expense as employees earn  postemployment
benefits  or  when  an  event,  such as a  disability,  triggers  postemployment
benefits,  rather  than on the  cash  basis.  Adoption  of SFAS  No.  112 had an
insignificant impact on the 1994 operating results.


NOTE 10--LEASES

The  company  leases  offices,   manufacturing  and  research  facilities,   and
warehouses,  as well as  transportation,  data processing,  and other equipment,
under capital and operating leases. A substantial number of these leases contain
options that allow the company to renew at the then fair rental value.


Future minimum payments under capitalized  leases and  noncancellable  operating
leases at April 30, 1994, were:

Rent expense for all operating leases was $18,510 in 1994,  $21,555 in 1993, and
$16,893 in 1992.


NOTE 11--LITIGATION SETTLEMENT

In  September  1992,  the company  and  Siemens AG settled  all  ongoing  patent
litigation  between  the  companies  and  cross-licensed  all  existing  patents
covering cardiac stimulation  devices.  Siemens made an initial payment of $50.0
million to Medtronic and will make ongoing royalty payments for approximately 10
years based on Siemens'  worldwide  sales of all  cardiac  stimulation  devices.
Medtronic will pay no royalties for the cross-license  received from Siemens. In
addition to the initial payment, which was recognized as income in 1993, Siemens
made a  $25.0  million  contingent  prepayment  against  future  royalties.  The
prepayment is being recognized as income when earned.


NOTE 12--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The company is  involved  in  litigation  and  disputes  which are normal to its
business.  Management  believes  losses that might  eventually be sustained from
such  litigation  and disputes  would not be material to future years.  Further,
product  liability  claims may be asserted in the future  relative to events not
known to  management at the present  time.  The company has  insurance  coverage
which management  believes is adequate to protect against such product liability
losses as could materially affect the company's financial position.

The Medtronic  Foundation,  funded  entirely by the company,  was established to
maintain good  corporate  citizenship in its  communities.  In 1993, the company
made a commitment to contribute $12,000 over a five-year period ending September
30, 1997.  At April 30,  1994,  the  remaining  balance of this  commitment  was
$11,365.  Commitments to the Medtronic  Foundation are expensed when  authorized
and approved by the company's Board of Directors.

Quarterly and annual  earnings per share are calculated  independently  based on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

In the first quarter of 1994, the company sold  substantially  all the assets of
its Andover Medical,  Inc.,  subsidiary for $21.0 million,  recognizing a pretax
gain of $14.0  million.  The first quarter was also affected by $14.3 million of
charges  which  primarily  relate to the impact of adoption of a new  accounting
principle  and  a  provision  for  potentially  uncollectible  trade  and  other
receivables.

In the second quarter of 1993, the company settled all ongoing patent litigation
with Siemens and recognized  income of $50.0 million.  In addition,  the company
recorded  a  commitment  to  the  Medtronic  Foundation  of  $12.0  million  and
accelerated   intangible  asset  amortization  of  $18.0  million.  For  further
information, see Notes 2, 11, and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.


NOTE 14--SEGMENT REPORTING

The company  operates in a single industry  segment--providing  medical products
and services.  Its business is segmented into three geographic areas--the United
States,  Europe, and other international markets. The geographic areas are, to a
significant degree, interdependent with respect to research, product supply, and
business  expertise.  Sales  between  geographic  areas are made at prices which
would approximate  transfers to unaffiliated  distributors.  In the presentation
below, the profit derived from such transfers is attributed to the area in which
the sale to the unaffiliated  customer is eventually made.  Because of the inter
dependence of the geographic areas, the operating profit as presented may not be
representative  of the  geographic  distribution  which would occur if the areas
were not interdependent.
