          Item 1.  Business

          GENERAL

          Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation (Allegheny or the Company)
          is a West Virginia corporation which was incorporated in 1981. 
          The Company is a diversified natural gas company whose principal
          subsidiary, Mountaineer Gas Company (Mountaineer), is the largest
          natural gas distribution utility in West Virginia.  Allegheny is
          also engaged in non-utility enterprises directly and through
          subsidiaries, including developmental drilling and production of
          natural gas in West Virginia and the marketing of natural gas
          directly to consumers in West Virginia.  The Company's past
          exploration and production activities in the Appalachian Basin of
          West Virginia have been conducted for its own account and through
          joint ventures with third parties and limited partnerships. 
          Allegheny has performed no drilling activities since fiscal 1992. 
          Allegheny's field services operations consist of the
          administration and operation of producing properties in West
          Virginia for which Allegheny is the operator.

          Mountaineer provides natural gas service to approximately 200,000
          residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers in 45
          counties in West Virginia, including the cities of Charleston,
          Beckley, Huntington and Wheeling.  Mountaineer owns and operates
          approximately 3,600 miles of natural gas distribution pipelines
          in West Virginia.  Acquired in 1984 from The Columbia Gas System,
          Inc., Mountaineer is regulated by the Public Service Commission
          of West Virginia (PSCWV).  In March 1993, Mountaineer, through
          its wholly-owned subsidiary Mountaineer Gas Services, Inc. (MGS),
          acquired all of the West Virginia assets of Hallwood Energy
          Partners, L.P. and Hallwood Consolidated Resources Corporation
          (Hallwood).  These assets included approximately 13.5 billion
          cubic feet (Bcf) of net natural gas reserves, approximately 274
          miles of natural gas transmission facilities and approximately
          19,600 net acres of undeveloped leaseholds.  The transaction was
          approved by the PSCWV, and MGS began operating the properties on
          April 1, 1993.  MGS was formed for the purpose of holding and
          operating the acquired assets.  Substantially all natural gas
          produced by MGS is sold to Mountaineer based on prices approved
          by the PSCWV.

          Allegheny's non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Gas Access
          Systems, Inc. (G.A.S.), sells natural gas directly to industrial,
          commercial and municipal customers in West Virginia.  G.A.S.
          markets natural gas produced by Allegheny as well as supplies
          obtained from other producers and wholesalers located in West
          Virginia and the continental United States.

          In November 1990, Allegheny entered into an agreement with a
          third party whereby the Company acquired a 50% interest in
          petroleum prospecting licenses, which were granted in February
          1991 and became effective in August 1991, covering approximately
          2.6 million acres in the North Island, New Zealand including<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 2

          acreage both onshore and offshore.  The Company has formed a New
          Zealand subsidiary, A&W Exploration New Zealand, Limited (AWENZ)
          which holds the Company's interests in the petroleum prospecting
          licenses.  During fiscal 1992, AWENZ acquired an additional 9.5%
          interest in the prospecting licenses.

          As of June 30, 1994, Allegheny's and MGS's combined net proved
          reserves were approximately 26.7 Bcf of natural gas and 28,000
          barrels of oil, based on reports from independent petroleum
          engineers.  See discussion of "Net Proved Oil and Gas Reserves"
          under Item 2.

          The principal offices of the Company are located at 300 Capitol
          Street, Suite 1600, Charleston, West Virginia  25301, and the
          telephone number is (304) 343-4567.

          NATURAL GAS UTILITY

          Mountaineer purchases, distributes and supplies natural gas to
          approximately 200,000 customers in 45 of West Virginia's 55
          counties, including the cities of Charleston, Beckley, Huntington
          and Wheeling.  Mountaineer is the largest natural gas
          distribution utility in West Virginia.

          More than 95% of the residential and commercial customers of
          Mountaineer use natural gas for heating.  Revenues, therefore,
          vary with the weather and temperature both seasonally and
          annually.  Industrial demand is dependent on local business
          conditions and competition from alternate sources of energy. 
          Demand for natural gas is also affected by Federal and state
          energy laws and regulations.

          Gas Supply

          During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, Mountaineer purchased
          75% of its natural gas supply from suppliers in the southwestern
          United States.  The remainder was supplied by local West Virginia
          producers (17%), MGS (6%), Allegheny (1%) and Columbia Gas
          Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) (1%), an
          affiliate of The Columbia Gas System, Inc.  During the fiscal
          year ended June 30, 1993, Mountaineer purchased 63% of its
          natural gas supply from suppliers in the southwestern United
          States.  The remainder was supplied by Columbia Transmission
          (19%), local West Virginia producers (15%), MGS (2%) and
          Allegheny (1%).  The decline in the natural gas supplied by
          Columbia Transmission is due to the implementation of the Federal
          Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) Order 636 et. seq., (the
          636 Orders).

          In 1992, the FERC issued the 636 Orders.  The 636 Orders required
          substantial restructuring of the service obligations of
          interstate pipelines.  Among other things, the 636 Orders
          mandated "unbundling" of existing pipeline gas sales services and
          replaced existing statutory abandonment procedures, as applied to
          firm transportation contracts of more than one year, with a
          right-of-first-refusal mechanism.  Mandatory unbundling required
          pipelines to sell separately the various components of their
          previous gas sales services (gathering, transportation and
          storage services, and gas supply).  To address concerns raised by
          utilities about reliability of service to their service
          territories, the 636 Orders required pipelines to offer a no-
          notice transportation service in which firm transporters can
          receive delivery of gas up to their contractual capacity level on
          any day without prior scheduling.  In addition, the 636 Orders
          provided for a mechanism for pipelines to recover prudently
          incurred transition costs associated with the restructuring
          process.

          All of Mountaineer's pipeline suppliers have filed their
          restructuring plans with the FERC.  The FERC has reviewed these
          plans; however, there are several issues which remain subject to
          further action by either the FERC or reviewing courts, including
          the ultimate sharing of transition costs, the level of no-notice
          protection and the impact on service reliability, and rate design
          implementation.  Mountaineer's largest pipeline supplier,
          Columbia Transmission, received orders from the FERC which
          approved its proposed restructuring filing with certain<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 4

          modifications.  One of the FERC modifications prohibited Columbia
          Transmission from recovering contract rejection claims it may
          incur in its bankruptcy proceeding as part of its transition
          costs.  Columbia Transmission and others have filed for appellate
          review of this disallowance.  In addition, Columbia Transmission
          filed a revised compliance plan with the FERC on October 22,
          1993, which was placed into effect on November 1, 1993, subject
          to further modification.

          As a consequence of the November 1, 1993 restructuring,
          Mountaineer has replaced the bundled firm sales service it
          previously received from Columbia Transmission with gas purchase
          arrangements negotiated with unregulated suppliers and firm
          transportation and storage agreements with Columbia Transmission. 
          Interim supply arrangements are in place, negotiations for long-
          term supplies are underway and the Company is reviewing its
          current level of firm service contracts to determine if
          additional capacity is necessary to provide reliable service to
          its customers.  Unresolved issues include whether the new
          unbundled transportation and storage services provided by
          Columbia Transmission, and the replacement natural gas supplies
          provided by others, will result in the same degree of service
          reliability as the bundled firm sales service Columbia
          Transmission has provided to Mountaineer in the past.  Because of
          these issues and others, Mountaineer has petitioned for appellate
          review of both the 636 Orders and the orders approving the
          implementation of Columbia Transmission's restructuring pursuant
          to the 636 Orders.  Mountaineer's management continues to
          actively participate in Columbia Transmission's compliance
          filings in order to protect Mountaineer's interests, ensure the
          continued reliability of service to its customers and minimize
          future transition costs.  

          Until Mountaineer's pipeline suppliers' rate filings to implement
          restructuring, including subsequent filings to recover 
          transition costs, are fully approved by the FERC, the ultimate
          amount of the costs associated with restructuring cannot be
          ascertained. However, Mountaineer's management anticipates that
          the amount of restructuring costs that will be passed through to
          Mountaineer will be significant.  Mountaineer will attempt to
          obtain approval from the PSCWV to recover any such approved
          restructuring costs from its customers.  On the basis of previous
          state regulatory proceedings involving the recovery of gas
          purchase costs and take-or-pay obligations, Mountaineer believes
          that the costs passed through from its pipeline suppliers will be
          recovered from ratepayers, although there can be no assurance
          that this will be the case.

          On July 31, 1991, Columbia Transmission and The Columbia Gas
          System, Inc. (the Columbia Companies) filed for protection under
          Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Columbia Companies stated
          that the primary basis for their filing was the failure of
          Columbia Transmission to acquire natural gas through existing
          producer contracts under terms and conditions, including price,
          which would permit Columbia Transmission to compete in the
          marketplace.  Columbia Transmission's filing could affect its
          relationship with Mountaineer.  Although Mountaineer only<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 5

          purchased 1% of its gas supplies from Columbia Transmission
          during fiscal 1994, Mountaineer relies upon Columbia Transmission
          for the delivery of a majority of Mountaineer's gas supplies. 

          On January 18, 1994, Columbia Transmission filed a proposed plan
          of reorganization in the bankruptcy proceedings, but requested
          the Bankruptcy Court to defer all further proceedings on such
          plan pending further discussions with Columbia Transmission's
          major creditors and official committees, including the official
          committee of customers which Mountaineer chairs.  The plan, if
          ultimately approved by the Bankruptcy Court and accepted by
          Columbia Transmission's customers, would inter alia, (i) pay
          Columbia Transmission's customers 100% of certain refund amounts
          ordered by the FERC, but at a lower interest rate than provided
          by the FERC, (ii) pay Columbia Transmission's customers 90% of
          certain other refunds ordered by the FERC, and (iii) require any
          customer accepting the plan to waive its entitlement to all other
          refund amounts and to not oppose Columbia Transmission's recovery
          from such customers of approximately $250 million in certain
          costs to be filed with the FERC.  Discussions on the proposed
          plan are at a preliminary stage and Columbia Transmission is in
          the process of providing additional information necessary to
          evaluate the proposal.  However, at this stage, various aspects
          of the proposal appear unacceptable to the official committee of
          customers.  

          In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the District
          of Columbia Circuit recently granted an appeal filed by
          Mountaineer and others which challenged Columbia Transmission's
          right to recover through FERC-approved rates over $120 million in
          take-or-pay costs from its customers.  Once the court's decision
          becomes final, the case will be remanded to the FERC for further
          proceedings to determine the level of refunds owed Columbia
          Transmission's customers.  The refund amount determined may have
          a significant bearing on Columbia Transmission's proposed plan of
          reorganization and any negotiated resolution thereof.

          Mountaineer is vigorously opposing Columbia Transmission's
          efforts to recover costs related to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy
          proceedings.  The outcome of these proceedings could materially
          affect Mountaineer's prices to its customers.  Mountaineer is
          reviewing its options, including the level of Columbia
          Transmission's role in providing service to Mountaineer in the
          future.  Mountaineer's management continues to be actively
          involved in this process in order to minimize any adverse impact
          on the interests of Mountaineer or its customers.

          Regulation and Rates

          Mountaineer is subject to the jurisdiction of the PSCWV as to
          various phases of its operations, including base and purchased
          gas adjustment rates and accounting and service standards. 
          Mountaineer's management continually reviews the adequacy of
          Mountaineer's rates and files requests for rate increases when it
          is deemed necessary and appropriate.  In addition, FERC
          regulations apply to various phases of Mountaineer's business,
          including the rates charged by interstate pipeline suppliers.<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 6

          On October 29, 1993, the PSCWV issued an order (the October 1993
          Order), effective November 1, 1993, regarding Mountaineer's
          request in January 1993 for increased base rates.  The October
          1993 Order, among other matters, provided for a 10.1% return on
          equity and rate increases which would generate additional annual
          revenues of approximately $3,400,000 under normal operating
          conditions.  In its original filing, Mountaineer requested a
          return on equity of 12.3% and rate increases that would result in
          increased annual revenues of $7,500,000.  On November 8, 1993,
          Mountaineer filed a petition for reconsideration of several
          issues contained in the October 1993 Order, including the granted
          rate of return on equity and the rate recovery mechanism of the
          cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB).  On
          March 30, 1994, the PSCWV issued a final order in this rate case
          (the March 1994 Final Order) after reconsidering several issues
          raised by various parties to the rate case.  In the March 1994
          Final Order, the PSCWV granted an increase in the authorized
          return on equity to 10.55% and established a tracking mechanism
          for certain OPEB costs.  The March 1994 Final Order also put
          Mountaineer on notice that in its next rate case, any savings
          generated by Mountaineer's participation in a consolidated tax
          return would be passed through to Mountaineer's ratepayers unless
          persuasive legal or accounting arguments are presented to the
          PSCWV to convince them to act otherwise.  Management is unable to
          determine what impact the consolidated tax savings issue will
          have on Mountaineer's future results of operations.

          The PSCWV does not guarantee Mountaineer a rate of return on its
          common equity; rather, it establishes rates which afford
          Mountaineer an "opportunity" to earn a certain rate of return
          under normal weather conditions, subject to the effectiveness of
          Mountaineer's operations.  During the years ended June 30, 1994,
          1993 and 1992, Mountaineer earned approximately $7.3 million,
          $4.8 million and $5.3 million, representing a 12.1%, 9.1% and
          11.0%  return on common equity, respectively.

          Mountaineer may pay dividends to Allegheny without regulation by
          the PSCWV; however, Mountaineer's rates established by the PSCWV
          are designed to permit a certain after-tax return on common
          equity and the payment of dividends could have a negative impact
          on Mountaineer's future applications for rate increases with the
          PSCWV.  Mountaineer's payment of dividends is restricted by the
          terms of its outstanding debt obligations (see Note 4 of the
          accompanying consolidated financial statements).  No dividends
          were paid during the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992. 
          Under the most restrictive terms of its debt obligations,
          Mountaineer would be permitted to pay dividends of approximately
          $11.7 million as of June 30, 1994.

          Competition

          Natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to
          customers, primarily on the basis of rates.  These alternate
          forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils.  Changes
          in the availability or price of natural gas or other forms of
          energy, as well as business conditions, conservation,
          legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 7

          fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for natural
          gas in areas served by Mountaineer.

          Mountaineer is also subject to competition from interstate and
          intrastate pipeline companies, producers and regulated or
          unregulated utilities which may be able to serve commercial and
          industrial customers from their transmission, gathering and/or
          distribution facilities.  In certain markets, gas has a
          competitive advantage over alternate fuels, while in other
          markets it is not as price competitive.

          In order to improve its competitive position, Mountaineer
          transports gas for certain industrial, commercial and residential
          customers who purchase natural gas directly from other sources. 
          Mountaineer's margin for such transportation services is
          generally the same as that generated by gas sales to these
          customers.

          Employees

          Mountaineer has entered into six different collective bargaining
          agreements covering several employee locations throughout the
          state of West Virginia.  These agreements expire at various times
          during the period of January 1995 through August 1997.  As of
          June 30, 1994, Mountaineer had 548 employees, of which 318
          employees were subject to such collective bargaining agreements. 
          Mountaineer currently considers relations with its employees to
          be satisfactory.

          NATURAL GAS MARKETING ACTIVITIES

          G.A.S. was formed in July 1987 to market Allegheny's production
          of natural gas.  In fiscal 1994, wells operated by Allegheny
          supplied approximately 48% of G.A.S.'s gas supply needs, and the
          balance was purchased from producers and wholesalers in West
          Virginia and the continental United States.  G.A.S. markets
          natural gas directly to industrial, commercial and municipal
          customers in West Virginia and arranges suitable transportation
          to the customers' premises.  G.A.S. has a policy of purchasing
          gas only to the extent of anticipated customer requirements as it
          maintains none of its own storage facilities.

          Contracts with G.A.S.'s customers for non-Allegheny gas supplies
          are typically for a limited duration, generally twelve months,
          may contain provisions for monthly price adjustments and do not
          include minimum or maximum usage requirements, although the
          provisions of specific agreements may vary.  Contracts involving
          gas purchased from Allegheny differ in that they may contain
          fixed daily volumes and either fixed or adjustable prices. 
          G.A.S. competes with other marketing firms on the basis of price
          and the ability to arrange suitable transportation to the
          customers' premises.

          MGS acquired the West Virginia assets of Hallwood in March 1993,
          and began operating such assets effective April 1, 1993.  These
          operations included the assumption of several sales contracts
          with large volume customers.  Natural gas supplies for these<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 8

          customers are purchased through agreements with producers and
          wholesalers on a month to month basis.  

          EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENTAL DRILLING AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES

          Allegheny

            Field Services

          Allegheny (not including subsidiaries discussed below) has
          conducted developmental drilling on properties for its own
          account and through limited partnerships and joint ventures;
          however, no drilling activity has been performed since fiscal
          1992.  Historically, during drilling operations, Allegheny
          managed all drilling activities on the properties and furnished,
          directly or through subcontractors, all necessary drilling,
          service and equipment requirements.  Allegheny acts as the
          operator for producing wells it has drilled and completed, for
          which it earns a fee in addition to reimbursement of certain
          direct operating expenses for wells drilled with limited
          partnerships and joint ventures.

            Developmental Drilling

          Allegheny has historically been engaged in developmental drilling
          of natural gas wells in West Virginia, principally in the
          Appalachian Basin.  Allegheny has drilled no exploratory wells in
          West Virginia in the last three fiscal years.  In addition,
          Allegheny has not engaged in any developmental drilling
          activities since fiscal 1992.  (Exploratory wells are those
          drilled in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a
          previously productive area, or to extend a known reservoir. 
          Development wells are those drilled within the proved area of a
          reservoir to a known productive depth.)  The extent of the
          Company's future drilling activities will depend upon, among
          other factors, the market prices of oil and gas, the Company's
          available funds, the Company's ability to raise funds in the
          capital markets and the Company's ability to attract industry
          partners.  While the Company's plans are subject to change,
          management does not currently anticipate that the Company will
          undertake any new exploration or development drilling during
          fiscal 1995.

          Allegheny obtains and investigates prospects through its own
          staff and/or in conjunction with third parties and acquires
          drilling and development rights which it considers to be of
          interest.

          The table below summarizes Allegheny's drilling activity for the
          years indicated.  There is no correlation between the number of
          productive wells completed during any period and the aggregate
          reserves attributable thereto.  The drilled wells represent the
          total wells drilled by Allegheny in West Virginia during the past
          three fiscal years all of which were drilled in conjunction with
          a drilling program with a major insurance company.<PAGE>

          The term "gross" as it applies to wells, refers to the aggregate
          number of wells in which Allegheny owns a direct or indirect
          working interest.  The term "net" refers to Allegheny's aggregate
          direct or indirect working interest in gross wells.

          As of June 30, 1994, Allegheny had a direct or indirect ownership
          interest in a total of 612 gross producing gas or combination gas
          and oil wells, which in the aggregate currently produce
          approximately 10,700 Mcf of natural gas and 45 barrels of oil per
          day.  Allegheny's weighted average net revenue interest in the
          volumes produced was approximately 27%.

          MGS

          During April 1993, MGS began operating the natural gas producing
          properties acquired from Hallwood.  The acquisition included
          interests in 392 natural gas producing wells and 19,600 acres of
          undeveloped leaseholds.  No additional wells were drilled by MGS
          in fiscal 1994.  In July 1994, MGS began its fiscal 1995 drilling
          program which anticipates the drilling and completion of five
          developmental wells.  MGS intends to drill additional gas wells
          for its own account over the next three years.  Production from
          these wells will be sold to Mountaineer at prices approved by the
          PSCWV.

          As of June 30, 1994, MGS had a direct ownership interest in 392
          gross producing gas wells, which in the aggregate currently
          produce approximately 4,500 Mcf of natural gas per day.  MGS's
          weighted average net revenue interest in the volumes produced is
          approximately 66%.

          New Zealand

          In July 1991, the Company formed AWENZ for the purpose of holding
          its 59.5% interest in two petroleum prospecting licenses covering
          approximately 2.6 million gross acres located in the North
          Island, New Zealand, both onshore and offshore.  The petroleum
          prospecting licenses are for a period of five years, beginning
          February 1991, permit the conduct of seismic testing and mapping
          and the performance of geological and geophysical analysis and
          the drilling of several exploratory wells.  AWENZ and its partner
          must maintain a work schedule defined in the licensing agreement
          to retain their interests in each of the licenses.  The Company
          and its partner have been granted an extension of the time period
          allowed for the completion of certain geological and geophysical
          work required under the licenses.  If the Company and its partner
          discover oil and gas reserves, they may elect to apply for a
          petroleum mining license from the Minister of Energy of New
          Zealand to develop certain selected parts of the acreage the
          prospecting licenses cover.

          AWENZ and its partner share the costs incurred under these
          licenses during the initial exploratory stage proportionally
          based on their ownership interests.  As of June 30, 1994, the
          Company had invested approximately US $943,000 in this
          arrangement.  In order to obtain the petroleum prospecting
          licenses, AWENZ and its partner posted a performance bond of NZ<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 11

          $500,000 (US $297,500 as of June 30, 1994), which is a normal
          requirement of the Minister of Energy.  Should AWENZ and its
          partner not perform their commitments as required by the
          licenses, the government of New Zealand could elect to call the
          bonds, which would require the payment by AWENZ of 59.5% of such
          amount.  To the best of management's knowledge, all such
          commitments currently required by the licenses have been
          performed.

          AWENZ and its partner are continuing to conduct and evaluate
          geological and geophysical seismic testing to determine the
          future potential, if any, for petroleum production from these
          regions.  Management will continue to monitor and assess the
          potential of the Company's investment in this prospect.

          General

          The Company is investigating other areas of West Virginia and
          elsewhere for acquisitions and drilling prospects to establish,
          expand or improve oil and gas production.

          Employees

          As of June 30, 1994, there were approximately 30 employees
          involved in producing activities for Allegheny, none of whom were
          subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  The Company
          considers relations with these employees to be satisfactory.  MGS
          employs supervisory and clerical personnel; however,substantially
          all drilling and producing operations are currently performed by
          third parties on a contract basis.

          Acreage

          The following table sets forth the approximate gross and net
          acres of undeveloped and developed oil and gas properties (all of
          which are located in West Virginia) in which Allegheny and MGS

          The term "gross" as it applies to acreage, refers to the
          aggregate acreage in which Allegheny and MGS own a direct or
          indirect working interest.  The term "net" refers to aggregate
          direct or indirect working interest in gross acres.

          As of June 30, 1994, a substantial portion of Allegheny's<PAGE>

          The average sales price of natural gas increased in fiscal 1994
          due to the increased market prices experienced throughout the
          natural gas industry.  The increase in average production costs
          and volumes sold in fiscal 1994 was primarily attributable to
          MGS's operations being in place for all of fiscal 1994 versus
          only three months in fiscal 1993.

          The average sales price of natural gas increased in fiscal 1993
          as a result of market conditions experienced throughout the
          industry.  Average production costs decreased significantly in
          fiscal 1993 as a result of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,
          TEX-HEX Corp., ceasing all production activities in April 1992
          and the effects of a full year of a cost reduction program
          implemented in fiscal 1992 by Allegheny.

          Substantially all production of natural gas from Allegheny's
          properties is sold to either G.A.S. or Mountaineer. 
          Substantially all production of natural gas from MGS's properties
          is sold to Mountaineer.  

          Financing of Exploration and Developmental Drilling Activities

          Allegheny's past exploration and drilling expenditures have been
          predominantly funded from internally generated capital, joint
          ventures, industry partners and limited partnerships.  While the
          Company's plans are subject to change, management does not
          currently anticipate that Allegheny will undertake any new<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 13

          exploration or development drilling during fiscal 1995.  The
          amount of Allegheny's future expenditures will depend on, among
          other factors, the market prices of oil and gas, Allegheny's
          available funds, its ability to raise funds in the capital
          markets, and its ability to attract industry partners.

          In July 1994, MGS began its fiscal year 1995 drilling program
          which anticipates the drilling and completion of five
          developmental wells.  MGS intends to drill additional natural gas
          wells for its own account over the next three years.  Financing
          for this drilling activity is expected to be raised from
          internally generated sources.  These expenditures are not
          expected to exceed $1.0 million in fiscal 1995.  Future MGS
          production will be sold to Mountaineer at prices approved by the
          PSCWV.  

          Competition

          The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases,
          including the exploration for new production and reserves,
          obtaining equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling
          activities and the acquisition of developed and undeveloped oil
          and gas properties on favorable terms.  Competition comes from
          major oil and gas companies as well as independent operators. 
          There is also competition among the oil and gas industry and
          other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of
          industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.  Also, domestic
          sources of oil and gas are subject to competition from foreign
          sources.  The Company competes in all of its activities with many
          other companies having far greater financial and other resources. 
          In addition, the Company competes with other sponsors of public
          and private drilling partnerships and joint ventures for
          investors.

          Regulation

          The Company's operations are affected in varying degrees by
          political developments and Federal and state laws and
          regulations.  In particular, oil and gas production operations
          and economics are affected by environmental, tax and other laws
          relating to the petroleum industry, by changes in such laws, and
          in administrative rules and regulations and in the interpretation
          and application thereof.

          In some areas where the Company conducts activities, there are
          statutory provisions regulating oil and gas drilling and
          production.  Such statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder
          require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and
          reports to be filed concerning operations on production from oil
          and gas wells.  

          Environmental Laws

          The Company's activities are subject to existing Federal and
          state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and
          pollution control.  Such laws and regulations may substantially
          increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 14

          and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation
          of a given operation.  In the opinion of management, the
          Company's operations comply with all applicable environmental
          laws and regulations.

          Federal Tax Laws

          The Company's operations are significantly affected by certain
          capital recovery and tax credit provisions of the Internal
          Revenue Code (IRC), as amended, applicable to the oil and gas
          industry.  Current law permits the Company to deduct currently,
          rather than capitalize, a portion of any intangible drilling
          costs (IDC) incurred or borne by it.  In addition, the IRC also
          contains a provision benefiting certain producers of fuel from
          non-conventional sources (the Section 29 credit), including
          Devonian Shale formations.  The current maximum Section 29 credit
          is $5.68 per barrel of oil or equivalent ($.9793 per dekatherm of
          natural gas) of qualified fuels.  The Omnibus Budget
          Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA) extended the tax credit to
          production from wells drilled through January 1, 1993 and
          produced prior to January 1, 2003.  OBRA also reinstated the
          eligibility of production from tight sands formations for a
          credit of $3.00 per barrel of oil or equivalent ($.5172 per
          dekatherm of natural gas).  The Company's ability to utilize
          Section 29 credits generated is dependent upon its current
          Federal tax liability.  To the extent the credits generated
          exceed the Company's current Federal tax liability, no carryback
          or carryforward of benefits is permitted.  (See Note 6 to the
          accompanying consolidated financial statements).  

          The Company is also impacted by the alternative minimum tax (AMT)
          rules of the IRC.  AMT is calculated based on taxable income
          under the regular tax provisions of the IRC adjusted for certain
          preference items, principally depreciation, utilizing a 20% tax
          rate.  The Company is required to pay the higher of the amount
          calculated utilizing the AMT rules or that calculated under the
          regular provisions of the IRC.  To the extent the AMT liability
          exceeds the regular liability, a carryforward is permitted to
          future tax years.

          In August 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (RRA 1993)
          was enacted into law.  RRA 1993, among other changes, increased
          the top marginal tax rate for corporations with taxable incomes
          in excess of $10 million from 34 to 35 percent effective January
          1, 1993, reduced or eliminated the ability to deduct certain
          business expenses and eliminated certain preference items in the
          calculation of the AMT effective January 1, 1994.  Management
          does not believe that RRA 1993 will have a material adverse
          effect on the Company's operations or financial position for the
          foreseeable future.

          Item 2.  Properties

          Utility Properties

          Mountaineer owns and operates a gas distribution system
          consisting of approximately 3,600 miles of underground
          distribution mains, ranging in size from one inch to twenty
          inches in diameter, together with service lines, and metering and
          regulating equipment.  The mains are located on easements or
          private rights-of-way.  In addition, Mountaineer owns equipment,
          garages, offices, shops and various metering and regulating
          buildings in its service area.

          Mountaineer's investment in its distribution system is considered
          suitable and adequate to deliver gas supplies to its consumers. 
          Mountaineer, as is typical within the industry, provides for an
          ongoing maintenance and replacement program.

          Transmission Facilities

          MGS owns and operates approximately 274 miles of a natural gas
          transmission system located in West Virginia.  This transmission
          system ranges in size from two to ten inches in diameter and is
          located on easements or private rights-of-way.

          Oil and Gas Field Offices

          Allegheny's drilling and production operations are directed from
          its offices in Charleston, West Virginia, with field operations
          facilities in Chelyan, West Virginia.

          MGS's producing operations are directed from its offices in
          Charleston, West Virginia.

          Reserves

          Allegheny's oil and gas reserves as of June 30, 1994 have been
          estimated by the independent petroleum engineering firms of
          Wright & Company, Inc. and Forrest A. Garb & Associates, Inc. 
          MGS's gas reserves have been estimated by the firm of Wright &
          Company, Inc.

          <F1> The estimates include only those amounts considered to be
               proved reserves and do not include additional amounts that
               may result from extensions of currently proved areas or
               amounts that may result from new discoveries in the future. 
               Proved developed reserves are those reserves that are
               expected to be recovered through existing wells with
               existing equipment and operating methods.

          In fiscal 1992, the Company changed the method by which it
          computes its net proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to
          the Company's interest in producing properties in which other
          third parties participate.  Beginning in fiscal 1992, the Company
          has determined the economic life of such reserves based, in part,
          upon operating costs that include general and administrative
          expenses charged to such properties.  Prior to fiscal 1992, the
          Company excluded such expenses when determining economic life. 
          This change reduced the economic life, which, in turn, reduced
          the estimated reserves.  This change resulted in a reduction of
          approximately 2,400,000 Mcf in natural gas reserves and 16,000
          Bbl in oil reserves, which is reflected in the above table within
          the fiscal 1992 revision of previous estimates of reserves.

          Pursuant to regulations of the Department of Energy, Allegheny
          filed with the U.S. Department of Energy Form EIA 23 -- Annual
          Report of Proved Domestic Gas Reserves for the previous fiscal
          year.  The reserve information furnished to the U.S. Department
          of Energy is consistent with the reserve information set forth
          above.  Allegheny has not filed oil or gas reserve information
          with any other federal or foreign governmental agency during the
          past year.

          Item 3.  Legal Matters

          Cameron Gas Company and C. Richard Coleman, et al. vs. Allegheny
          & Western Energy Corporation, Mountaineer Gas Company and Gas
          Access Systems, Inc. was filed on December 31, 1992, in the
          Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia.  Plaintiffs
          allege unlawful and/or tortious conduct and violations of the
          Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and the
          West Virginia Anti-Trust Act, arising out of the termination of a
          gas sales agreement and seek $30 million compensatory damages and
          $90 million punitive damages.  Upon the petition of the Company,
          the case was removed to the United States District Court for the
          Northern district of West Virginia.  On February 19, 1993, the
          Company filed responsive dispositive pleadings to the complaint,
          including a motion to dismiss.  By Order issued March 31, 1994,
          and clarified by Order issued April 18, 1994, the West Virginia
          anti-trust claim against Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation,
          Mountaineer Gas Company and Gas Access Systems, Inc. was
          dismissed with prejudice.  In addition, the RICO claim was
          dismissed against Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation with
          prejudice.  On April 14, 1994, Mountaineer filed a general denial
          to plaintiffs' complaint and a counterclaim seeking at least
          $150,000 in compensatory and $2.0 million in punitive damages for
          the willful withholding by Cameron of monies collected by Cameron
          as agent for certain of the Company's customers and intended to
          be paid to the Company for services rendered by the Company.  In
          response to the April 18, 1994 Order, the plaintiffs filed an
          amended complaint to which the Company has filed responsive
          pleadings, including a motion to dismiss, and a counterclaim. 
          The pleadings remain pending before the Court for disposition. 
          Discovery has commenced.  No trial date has been set.  The
          Company believes Cameron's claims are without merit and plans to
          vigorously defend this matter and does not believe that this
          matter is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 20

          the financial position and results of operations of the Company.

          The Company has been named as a defendant in various other legal
          actions which arise primarily in the ordinary course of business. 
          In management's opinion, the outcome of such actions will not
          have a material effect on the financial position and results of
          operations of the Company.

          Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

          No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during
          the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

          Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
          Condition and Results of Operations

          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FISCAL 1994 COMPARISON TO FISCAL 1993

          Gas Distribution and Marketing Operations

          Gas distribution revenues are derived from Allegheny's wholly-
          owned subsidiaries, Mountaineer Gas Company (Mountaineer), a
          regulated utility, Gas Access Systems, Inc. (G.A.S.), a gas
          marketing company, as well as from Mountaineer's wholly-owned
          subsidiary, Mountaineer Gas Services, Inc. (MGS), a producer and
          marketer of natural gas.  Total gas distribution and marketing
          revenues for such subsidiaries increased by approximately $17.0
          million during fiscal 1994.  

          Net gas distribution revenues for Mountaineer increased $9.8
          million during fiscal 1994.  During this period, Mountaineer
          recorded a $17 million charge to revenues relating to
          Mountaineer's passthrough to its customers of refunds received
          from Mountaineer's pipeline suppliers.  This $17 million charge
          was offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of gas
          distributed.  The increased revenues were primarily related to
          increased volumes of gas sold due to colder weather conditions in
          its service area and, to a lesser extent, increased base and
          purchased gas adjustment rates  which became effective November
          1, 1993.  This increase was partially offset by small commercial
          customers obtaining transportation services in lieu of purchasing
          gas supplies from Mountaineer.  (See table of Mountaineer's
          operating revenues and related volumes contained in Item 1.)

          Gas distribution revenues of G.A.S. increased approximately $1.6
          million during fiscal 1994.  This increase was attributable to
          improved sales prices due to industry market conditions and
          higher sales volumes due to colder weather in G.A.S.'s service
          area.

          MGS began operating the assets purchased from Hallwood on April
          1, 1993.  These assets included the assumption of several sales
          contracts with large volume customers.  The sales revenues
          generated by these  contracts increased approximately $5.6
          million during fiscal 1994 due primarily to MGS's operations
          being in place  for all of fiscal 1994 versus only three months
          of fiscal 1993.

          Oil and Gas Operations

          Revenues relating to oil and gas operations are derived from the
          activities of Allegheny and MGS and, prior to fiscal 1993,
          Allegheny's wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, TEX-HEX.  Allegheny's
          and MGS's operations are located in the Appalachian Basin of West
          Virginia.  TEX-HEX's operations were located in south Texas.

          Oil and gas sales increased approximately $2.3 million during
          fiscal 1994.  Oil and gas sales of MGS increased approximately
          $2.4 million  during fiscal 1994 due primarily to MGS's
          operations being in place for all of fiscal 1994 versus only<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 25

          three months of fiscal 1993.  Oil and gas sales of Allegheny
          decreased approximately $.1 million during fiscal 1994 as reduced
          production volumes were virtually offset by higher average sales
          prices.

          Field Services

          Field service revenues include amounts charged for the
          administration and operation of producing properties, the
          operation of pipeline systems and amounts charged for management
          of drilling operations.

          Field service revenues of Allegheny decreased approximately $.1
          million during fiscal 1994 as a result of a reduction in gas
          transportation revenues due to lower throughput volumes.  

          Investment and Other Income

          Investment income is earned primarily from investments in short-
          term repurchase agreements, bond funds, commercial paper and
          United States Treasury obligations.

          Investment and other income decreased approximately $.3 million
          during fiscal 1994.  This decrease was attributable to reduced
          cash available for investment by Mountaineer due to capital
          expenditure and working capital requirements and reduced cash
          available for investment by Allegheny due to purchases of
          treasury stock pursuant to its previously announced stock
          repurchase program.

          OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES

          Cost of Gas Distributed/Marketed

          Cost of gas distributed/marketed includes the cost of gas
          recovered by Mountaineer from its customers as permitted in its
          purchased gas adjustment clause provided for by state regulatory
          provisions and the cost of gas purchased by G.A.S. and MGS for
          resale to their respective customers.  Total costs of gas
          distributed/marketed by Allegheny's direct and indirect
          subsidiaries increased approximately $9.3 million during fiscal
          1994.  

          Costs of gas distributed by Mountaineer increased approximately
          $2.7 million from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994.  During this
          period, Mountaineer recorded a $17 million charge to cost of gas
          distributed relating to Mountaineer's passthrough to its
          customers of refunds received from Mountaineer's pipeline
          suppliers.  This $17 million charge was offset by a corresponding
          charge to gas distribution revenues.  The increase was primarily
          a result of increased volumes of gas sold due to colder weather
          conditions in Mountaineer's service area and increased purchased
          gas adjustment rates which became effective November 1, 1993.  

          Gas costs of G.A.S. increased approximately $1.4 million from
          fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994.  This increase resulted from
          increased volumes of gas sold due to colder weather conditions in<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 26

          G.A.S.'s service area and higher market prices as a result of
          industry market conditions.  

          MGS purchased gas costs increased approximately $5.2 million
          during fiscal 1994 due primarily to MGS's operations being in
          place for all of fiscal 1994 versus only three months of fiscal
          1993.

          Exploration, Lease Operating and Production Expenses

          Exploration, lease operating and production expenses include
          costs incurred by Allegheny and MGS and formerly by TEX-HEX in
          conducting field operations for producing properties and in
          exploring for potential new sources of oil and gas reserves.

          Exploration, lease operating and production expenses increased
          approximately $.9 million from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994.  MGS's
          lease operating and production expenses increased approximately
          $1.1 million during fiscal 1994  due primarily to MGS's
          operations being in place for all of fiscal 1994 versus only
          three months of fiscal 1993.  Allegheny's expenses decreased
          approximately $.2 million during fiscal 1994 as a result of
          decreases in various categories of production expenses.  

          Distribution, General and Administrative Expenses

          Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased
          approximately $3.9 million during fiscal 1994 as compared to
          fiscal 1993.  This was primarily the result of increased expenses
          of Mountaineer associated with normal increases in employee labor
          and employee benefit costs.  Additionally, approximately $.6
          million of the increase is attributable to the adoption of the
          Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
          Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
          Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions".  See Note 8 to the
          accompanying consolidated financial statements.

          Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization

          Depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses increased
          approximately $.5 million during fiscal 1994.  This increase was
          primarily a result of depreciation on fiscal 1994 utility plant
          additions of Mountaineer and increased  depletion recorded by MGS
          for fiscal 1994 due to MGS's operations being in place for all of
          fiscal 1994 compared to only three months of fiscal 1993.

          Interest Expense

          Total interest expense remained unchanged during fiscal 1994 as
          Mountaineer's higher average outstanding short-term borrowings
          during fiscal 1994 were offset by a reduction in long-term debt
          outstanding during fiscal 1994.  Mountaineer's increase in short-
          term borrowings were due to  working capital and capital
          expenditure requirements.

          Income Taxes

          The effective income tax rate was 20.1% for fiscal 1994 and 24.8%<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 27

          for fiscal 1993.  The recorded income tax provision reflects the
          40% net statutory rate for Federal and state purposes, offset
          primarily by Federal tax credits permitted for fuels produced
          from a non-conventional source and the benefit from book
          amortization of an acquisition adjustment.  The decrease in the
          effective rate for fiscal 1994 reflects increased estimated
          utilization of Federal tax credits based on anticipated levels of
          Federal taxable income.

          Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

          Effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of
          accounting for income taxes as required by SFAS No. 109,
          "Accounting for Income Taxes".  As permitted by SFAS No. 109, the
          Company recognized the cumulative effect prior to July 1, 1993 of
          the change in the method of accounting for income taxes in the
          period of adoption.  Accordingly, the Company reflected a credit
          of $1,562,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1994.  This amount
          was primarily the result of reduced currently enacted tax rates
          compared to those in effect at the time deferred taxes were
          recognized for certain differences between financial reporting
          and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FISCAL 1993 COMPARISON TO FISCAL 1992

          Gas Distribution and Marketing Operations

          Total gas distribution and marketing revenues increased by
          approximately $4.7 million during fiscal 1993.  Gas distribution
          revenues for Mountaineer increased $1.8 million during fiscal
          1993.  This increase was caused primarily by the recording in
          fiscal 1992 of a reduction in revenues to reflect the cumulative
          effect of reduced take-or-pay billings to certain classes of
          customers totalling $3.8 million pursuant to a final order issued
          by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (March 1992
          Final Order) in March 1992.  This adjustment to revenues was
          offset by a corresponding credit to purchased gas costs.  This
          increase was partially offset by decreased volumes of gas sold as
          a result of smaller commercial customers switching to
          transportation service from gas sales service during fiscal 1993. 
          (See table of Mountaineer's operating revenues and related
          volumes contained in Item 1.)

          Gas distribution revenues of G.A.S. increased approximately $.7
          million during fiscal 1993.  This increase was attributable to
          improved sales prices as a result of industry market conditions. 
          This increase was partially offset by lower volumes sold
          resulting primarily from a decision to not renew several
          marginally profitable large-volume sales contracts during fiscal
          1992.

          MGS began operating the assets purchased from Hallwood on April
          1, 1993.  These assets included the assumption of several sales
          contracts with large volume customers.  These contracts generated
          sales revenues of approximately $1.9 million during the three
          months ended June 30, 1993.<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 28

          Oil and Gas Operations

          Oil and gas sales decreased approximately $.6 million during
          fiscal 1993.  This decrease is primarily attributable to the
          cessation by TEX-HEX of all oil and gas producing operations in
          April 1992.  TEX-HEX had oil and gas sales of $1.1 million in
          fiscal 1992.  Oil and gas sales of Allegheny decreased $.2
          million during fiscal 1993 as a result of normal production
          declines partially offset by improved average sales prices.  The
          above decreases were partially offset by $.7 million in oil and
          gas sales by MGS which began operations in April 1993.

          Field Services

          Field service revenues decreased approximately $.3 million during
          fiscal 1993.  These decreases resulted primarily from the
          discontinuance of TEX-HEX's operations and a reduction in
          Allegheny's gas transportation revenues resulting from lower
          throughput volumes.

          Investment and Other Income

          Investment and other income decreased approximately $.5 million
          during fiscal 1993.  This decrease was mainly attributable to the
          recording in fiscal 1992 of a non-recurring $.3 million credit
          relating to carrying costs associated with the recovery of take-
          or-pay charges which Mountaineer was permitted to recover
          pursuant to the March 1992 Final Order.  In addition, Mountaineer
          had reduced levels of cash available for investment due to
          capital expenditure and working capital requirements.

          OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES

          Cost of Gas Distributed/Marketed

          Total costs of gas distributed/marketed increased approximately
          $2.6 million during fiscal 1993.  Costs of gas distributed by
          Mountaineer decreased approximately $.6 million from fiscal 1992
          to fiscal 1993.  This decrease was due to smaller commercial
          customers switching to transportation service from gas sales
          service and the elimination of the recovery of take-or-
          pay/contract reformation costs for several customer classes. 
          These decreases were partially offset by the cumulative effect of
          reduced take-or-pay billings to certain classes of customers
          totalling $3.8 million which were recorded in March and April of
          1992 as a result of the March 1992 Final Order.

          Gas costs of G.A.S. increased approximately $1.0 million from
          fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993.  This increase resulted primarily
          from higher market prices due to industry market conditions. 
          This increase was partially offset by overall lower sales volumes
          resulting from a decision to not renew several marginally
          profitable large-volume sales contracts in fiscal 1992.

          MGS incurred purchased gas costs of $2.1 million during its three
          months of operations in fiscal 1993.<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 29

          Exploration, Lease Operating and Production Expenses

          Exploration, lease operating and production expenses decreased
          approximately $1.1 million from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993.  This
          reduction is primarily the result of TEX-HEX ceasing all field
          operations in April 1992.  In addition, Allegheny's expenses
          decreased approximately $.5 million during fiscal 1993 as a
          result of reductions in its West Virginia field operations
          workforce in February 1992 and decreases in various other
          categories of production expenses.  These decreases were
          partially offset by MGS's lease operating and production expenses
          of $.4 million incurred during its three months of operations.

          Distribution, General and Administrative Expenses

          Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased
          approximately $.3 million during fiscal 1993 as compared to
          fiscal 1992.  This was primarily the result of increased expenses
          of Mountaineer associated with normal increases in employee labor
          costs.  These increases were partially offset by the closure of
          TEX-HEX's Houston, Texas office which incurred approximately $.8
          million of expenses during fiscal 1992.

          Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization

          Depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased
          approximately $.3 million during fiscal 1993.  This decrease was
          primarily the result of the sale of substantially all of TEX-
          HEX's assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992 and lower
          volumes produced by Allegheny.  This decrease was partially
          offset by depreciation on fiscal 1993 utility plant additions and
          depletion recorded by MGS during its three months of operations.

          Interest Expense

          Total interest expense increased $.7 million in fiscal 1993. 
          This increase was primarily the result of Mountaineer having
          higher average outstanding borrowings during fiscal 1993 as a
          result of capital expenditure and working capital requirements. 
          These increases were partially offset by lower interest rates in
          effect during fiscal 1993.

          Income Taxes

          The effective income tax rate was 24.8% for fiscal 1993 and 5.1%
          for fiscal 1992.  The recorded income tax provision reflects the
          40% net statutory rate for Federal and state purposes, offset
          primarily by Federal tax credits permitted for fuels produced
          from a non-conventional source and the benefit from the book
          amortization of an acquisition adjustment.  The increase in the
          effective rate for fiscal 1993 reflects reduced estimated
          utilization of Federal tax credits based on anticipated levels of
          Federal taxable income.

          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Short-Term Borrowings and Lines-of-Credit<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 30


          Mountaineer had unsecured short-term line-of-credit agreements
          with banks totaling $57.5 million as of June 30, 1994. 
          Borrowings on these lines-of-credit are anticipated to be used
          primarily to finance gas purchases and provide working capital
          during Mountaineer's peak sales period.  As of June 30, 1994,
          $18,703,000 was outstanding under these lines-of-credit.  In
          addition, Mountaineer has an additional $15 million revolving
          line-of-credit facility which is available for borrowing until
          December 31, 1996.

          Allegheny has a revolving credit facility with two banks
          totalling $5 million.  The $5 million revolving credit facility
          is anticipated to be used primarily to finance working capital
          needs (see Notes 4 and 5 to the accompanying consolidated
          financial statements).  No borrowings were made under this
          facility in fiscal 1994.

          Mountaineer and Allegheny's lines-of-credit are typically in
          effect for a period of one year and are renewed on a year-to-year
          basis.

          Working Capital

          Working capital ratios are a measure of a company's ability to
          meet its short-term obligations.  The following table shows the
          Company's consolidated working capital as of the dates shown:


          <TABLE>
          <CAPTION>

                                   June 30,       June 30,       June 30,
                                     1994           1993           1992    

          <S>                    <C>            <C>            <C>

          Working capital ratio    0.83 to 1      0.94 to 1      1.40 to 1


          </TABLE>

          The deficiency in working capital at June 30, 1994 is
          attributable to Mountaineer's requirement of significant working
          capital funds to finance the acquisition of the West Virginia
          assets of Hallwood by MGS in fiscal 1993 and to fund fiscal 1994
          capital expenditures.  Management believes it has sufficient
          lines-of-credit in place to meet maturities of long-term debt and
          working capital requirements.

          Capital Expenditures

          Capital expenditures were approximately $13.3 million and $22.3
          million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993. 
          Substantially all of the Company's fiscal 1994 capital
          expenditures were attributable to the Company's gas distribution
          operations.  Such expenditures were financed primarily by<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 31

          internally generated funds and short-term borrowings.

          Fiscal 1995 Expenditures

          The extent of Allegheny's drilling activities in fiscal 1995, if
          any, will depend upon, among other factors, the market price of
          natural gas, Allegheny's available funds, Allegheny's ability to
          raise funds in the capital markets and Allegheny's ability to
          attract industry partners.  While Allegheny's plans are subject
          to change in light of the foregoing, management does not
          currently anticipate that Allegheny will undertake any new
          exploration or development drilling during fiscal 1995. 
          Allegheny is continuing to seek attractive acquisition candidates
          in order to expand its operations; however it is impossible to
          determine what expenditures may be required to fund these
          activities, if successful.

          Utility construction expenditures are estimated to be
          approximately $13.7 million.

          MGS's natural gas drilling expenditures are expected to be $1.0
          million.

          Management believes that the Company has sufficient internally
          generated funds, working capital resources and lines-of-credit to
          meet these anticipated capital expenditures.

          Dividend Restrictions

          Mountaineer's outstanding debt obligations restrict the amount of
          dividends that Mountaineer can pay to the Company (see Note 4 to
          the accompanying consolidated financial statements).  As of June
          30, 1994, under the most restrictive terms of its debt
          obligations, Mountaineer would be permitted to pay dividends of
          $11.7 million to the Company.  The limitations on Mountaineer's
          ability to pay dividends are not expected to have a significant
          impact on the Company's ability to meet its cash requirements.

          Seasonality of Business

          Mountaineer's retail gas distribution sales are highly seasonal
          and fluctuate significantly dependent upon weather conditions
          experienced in Mountaineer's service area.  Typically, the
          weather conditions result in higher operating revenues and net
          income from October through March and lower operating revenues
          and either net losses or reduced net income from April through
          September.  Weather conditions also have a significant impact on
          Mountaineer's cash flow requirements.  Typically, cash
          expenditure requirements are greatest during May through January
          in preparation for and during the winter heating season due to
          gas purchase requirements.  Cash inflows are at their highest
          levels typically from January through April due to heating
          requirements of Mountaineer's customers.  Mountaineer utilizes
          lines-of-credit and internally generated funds to meet its
          seasonal capital requirements.

          Impact of Inflation

          Fluctuations in prices and costs are primarily a matter of supply
          and demand with respect to oil and gas operations and, to a much
          lesser degree, inflation.  The inflationary impact on gas
          distribution operations is considered in periodic rate cases.  On
          October 29, 1993, the PSCWV issued the October 1993 Order, which
          was  effective November 1, 1993, regarding Mountaineer's request
          in January 1993 for increased base rates.  The October 1993
          Order, among other matters, provided for a 10.1% return on equity
          and rate increases which would generate additional annual
          revenues of approximately $3,400,000 under normal operating
          conditions.  In its original filing, Mountaineer requested a
          return on equity of 12.3% and rate increases that would result in
          increased annual revenues of $7,500,000.  On November 8, 1993,
          Mountaineer filed a petition for reconsideration of several
          issues contained in the October 1993 Order, including the granted
          rate of return on equity and the rate recovery mechanism of OPEB
          costs.  On March 30, 1994, the PSCWV issued the March 1994 Final
          Order in this rate case, after reconsidering several issues
          raised by various parties to the rate case.  In the March 1994
          Final Order the PSCWV granted an increase in the authorized
          return on equity to 10.55% and established a tracking mechanism
          for certain OPEB costs.

          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting
          for Income Taxes"

          In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
          issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
          109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The Company adopted the
          provisions of SFAS No. 109 effective July 1, 1993 and elected not
          to restate the financial statements of prior years.  The adoption
          of SFAS No. 109 required the Company to convert from the deferred
          method to the liability method to recognize deferred taxes. 
          Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
          are determined based on differences between financial reporting
          and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
          the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
          differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets and
          liabilities are adjusted for future changes in tax rates.  Under
          the deferred method, deferred tax expense was based on items of
          income and expense that were reported in different years in the
          financial statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax
          rate in effect in the year the difference originated.  As
          permitted by SFAS No. 109, the Company elected not to restate the
          financial statements of any prior years, but to record the
          cumulative effect of the change in accounting for income taxes in
          the year of adoption.  The recording of the cumulative effect of
          this change in accounting for income taxes did not impact pre-tax
          income from continuing operations; however, net income increased
          approximately $1,562,000, or $.20 per share.  The increase in net
          income was primarily the result of reduced currently enacted tax
          rates compared to those in effect at the time the deferred taxes
          were previously recognized.  The adoption of SFAS No. 109 by
          Mountaineer resulted in an increase in accumulated deferred
          income taxes which was offset by a corresponding increase in a<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 33

          regulatory asset account, which resulted from the recording of
          certain deferred taxes which were not previously recognized due
          to state ratemaking practices.  This amount (approximately
          $8,539,000 at June 30, 1994) has been reflected in other assets.

          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
          Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"

          Effective July 1, 1993, Mountaineer adopted SFAS No. 106,
          "Employers  Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
          Pensions" (OPEB).  SFAS No. 106 significantly changes the
          accounting, measurement and disclosure practices with respect to
          OPEB's.  SFAS No. 106 requires that the expected cost of OPEB's
          be charged to expense during the period of an employee's service
          rather than expensing such costs as claims are incurred.  Under
          Mountaineer's medical and life insurance plan for retired
          employees, the attribution period is equivalent to the 10-year
          period prior to the employee reaching eligible retirement age. 
          As permitted by SFAS No. 106, Mountaineer has elected to amortize
          the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation existing at the
          date of adoption ("transition obligation") over a 20-year period. 
          Prior to fiscal 1994, Mountaineer recognized postretirement
          health care and life insurance benefits in the year the benefits
          were paid.  The cost of retirees' benefits paid in fiscal 1994,
          1993 and 1992 was approximately $297,000, $525,000 and $347,000,
          respectively.  Retiree benefits recognized by Mountaineer
          pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 106 were $1,117,000 in
          fiscal 1994.

          As part of the October 1993 Order, the PSCWV ruled that the
          permitted rate recovery mechanism for OPEB's will be a modified
          accrual method (see Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated
          financial statements).  The modified accrual method allows for
          the recovery of current service costs on an accrual basis and
          recovery of the transition obligation on a cash basis. 
          Accounting for the transition obligation on a cash method is not
          an acceptable accounting method under generally accepted
          accounting principles.  Mountaineer is recording its other
          postretirement benefit expense in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
          which is in excess of the permitted rate recovery as a result of
          the PSCWV's ruling.  Mountaineer currently estimates that the
          amount of SFAS No. 106 expense (net of those amounts expected to
          be capitalized) in excess of the modified accrual basis would be
          approximately $300,000 in fiscal 1995 and would accumulate to
          approximately $3,000,000 over the remaining nineteen year
          amortization period for transition costs.  These amounts will be
          recovered through rates in later years when the cash basis of
          prior service costs exceeds the accrual basis of such costs.

          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
          Accounting for Postemployment Benefits"

          In November 1992, the FASB issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers
          Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  This statement requires
          employers to recognize any obligation which exists to provide
          benefits to former or inactive employees after employment, but
          before retirement. Such benefits include, but are not limited to,<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 34

          salary continuations, supplemental unemployment, severance
          disability (including workers' compensation), job training,
          counseling and continuation of benefits such as health care and
          life insurance.  Currently, the Company provides only for
          workers' compensation benefits which would qualify as
          postemployment benefits under this standard.  

          The Company will adopt this statement in fiscal 1995.  The
          adoption of SFAS No. 112 is not expected to have a material
          impact on the Company's results of operations.

                       Report of Independent Public Accountants



          To the Directors and Stockholders of
          Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation:


          We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
          ALLEGHENY & WESTERN ENERGY CORPORATION (a West Virginia
          corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993 and
          the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
          stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
          in the period ended June 30, 1994.  These consolidated financial
          statements and the schedules referred to below are the
          responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 35

          is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
          statements and schedules based on our audits.

          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
          auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
          perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
          the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
          audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
          the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
          audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
          significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
          the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
          our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
          above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
          position of Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation and
          subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
          their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
          in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
          accepted accounting principles.

          As discussed in Notes 6 and 8, effective July 1, 1993, the
          Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and
          other postretirement benefits pursuant to standards promulgated
          by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

          Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
          basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.  The
          schedules listed under Item 14(a)(2) are presented for purposes
          of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
          and are not a required part of the basic consolidated financial
          statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the auditing
          procedures applied in our audits of the basic consolidated
          financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state, in all
          material respects, the financial data required to be set forth
          therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
          statements taken as a whole.

                        ALLEGHENY & WESTERN ENERGY CORPORATION

                                   AND SUBSIDIARIES

                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



          (1)  ORGANIZATION

          Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation (Allegheny or the Company)
          and its subsidiaries are engaged in the exploration, production,
          distribution and marketing of natural gas.  The exploration and
          production of natural gas is performed in the Appalachian Basin
          of West Virginia.  The Company's past exploration and production
          activities have been conducted for its own account and through
          joint ventures with third parties and limited partnerships. 
          Allegheny has performed no drilling activities since fiscal 1992. 
          Beginning in fiscal 1990, principally all of Allegheny's gas
          production was sold to either Mountaineer Gas Company
          (Mountaineer) or Gas Access Systems, Inc. (G.A.S.), both wholly-
          owned subsidiaries.

          Mountaineer is a regulated gas distribution utility servicing
          approximately 200,000 residential, commercial, industrial and
          wholesale customers in the State of West Virginia.  Mountaineer
          was acquired by Allegheny on June 21, 1984 from The Columbia Gas
          System, Inc.  During fiscal year 1993, Mountaineer formed a
          wholly-owned subsidiary, Mountaineer Gas Services, Inc. (MGS),
          for the purpose of owning and operating the producing properties
          and transmission plant assets acquired from Hallwood Energy
          Partners, L.P. and Hallwood Consolidated Resources Corporation
          (Hallwood) (see Note 3).

          The Company markets natural gas directly to industrial,
          commercial and municipal customers through its non-regulated
          subsidiary, G.A.S.  G.A.S. was created in July 1987 and markets
          the production of Allegheny as well as supplies of natural gas
          purchased from various producers and wholesalers in the
          Appalachian Basin of West Virginia and the continental United
          States.

          In November 1989, the Company formed a wholly-owned Texas
          subsidiary, TEX-HEX Corp. (TEX-HEX).  TEX-HEX performed
          exploration and production activities in south Texas, primarily
          utilizing horizontal drilling techniques.  Effective April 1,
          1992, TEX-HEX sold all its producing properties.  All of TEX-
          HEX's operations ceased effective June 1992.

          In November 1990, Allegheny entered into an agreement with a
          third party whereby Allegheny acquired a 50% interest in
          petroleum prospecting licenses, which were granted in February
          1991 and became effective in August 1991, covering approximately
          2.6 million acres in the North Island, New Zealand including
          acreage both onshore and offshore.  The Company formed a New
          Zealand subsidiary, A&W Exploration New Zealand, Limited (AWENZ),
          which now holds the Company's interests in the petroleum<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 44

          prospecting licenses.  During fiscal 1992, AWENZ acquired an
          additional 9.5% interest in the prospecting licenses.  As of June
          30, 1994, the Company had invested approximately $943,000 in this
          arrangement, all of which has been charged to expense.

          (2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          Principles of Consolidation

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
          Allegheny and all its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany
          items have been eliminated except those relating to sales of
          natural gas to Mountaineer by Allegheny and MGS.  During the
          years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company received
          approximately $140,000, $211,000 and $427,000, respectively, for
          their interests in this gas production.  MGS made sales of
          approximately $4,222,000 and $959,000 to Mountaineer during
          fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Prices at which natural gas
          is sold by affiliates to Mountaineer is regulated and approved by
          the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (PSCWV).

          Basis of Accounts

          Mountaineer and MGS maintain their accounts in conformity with
          generally accepted accounting principles for regulated entities
          which is in accordance with the accounting requirements and
          ratemaking practices prescribed by the PSCWV.

          Revenue Recognition

          Oil and gas production, including royalties and overrides, is
          recognized as income as it is extracted and sold from properties. 
          Income from field services is recognized as the related services
          are performed.

          Utility revenues are based on amounts billed to customers on a
          cycle basis and estimated amounts for gas delivered but unbilled
          at the end of each accounting period.  Accounts receivable
          include $1,701,000, and $1,644,000 of gas delivered but unbilled
          as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Mountaineer is
          subject to a purchased gas adjustment clause and records gas cost
          as an expense as it is recovered through billings to customers. 
          The differences between actual gas costs and those recovered are
          deferred.  PSCWV regulations provide for annual proceedings
          concerning gas purchases and cost recovery.

          Revenues of G.A.S. are based on volumes delivered at the end of
          each month.  Gas purchases are accrued at prices negotiated with
          vendors and matched with the corresponding gas sales.

          Short-Term Investments

          Short-term investments consist of United States Treasury
          obligations and are stated at amortized cost which approximates
          market.  It is the Company's intent to hold short-term
          investments until maturity.<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 45

          Property, Plant and Equipment and Related Depletion,
          Depreciation, and Amortization

          Utility Plant - Property, plant and equipment of Mountaineer is
          stated at original cost, reduced by a purchase accounting
          adjustment for regulatory purposes, and includes overheads for
          payroll related costs, administrative and general expenses, as
          well as an allowance for funds used during construction of
          approximately $42,700 and $66,700 in fiscal 1994 and 1993,
          respectively.  The provision for depreciation is computed based
          on a composite straight-line method.  The average composite
          depreciation rates were 3.72%, 3.68% and 3.62% for fiscal 1994,
          1993 and 1992, respectively.

          A purchase accounting adjustment of approximately $15,616,000 is
          being amortized by Mountaineer over the estimated remaining
          useful lives of the related property.  The amortization period
          ends in 1998.

          Oil and Gas Property - The Company accounts for its natural gas
          exploration and production activities under the successful
          efforts method of accounting.

          Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when
          incurred.  Unproved properties are assessed on a property-by-
          property basis and any impairment in value is recognized.  If the
          unproved properties are determined to be productive, the
          appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas
          properties.  Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.

          Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling
          exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred.  The costs
          of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending
          determination of whether proved reserves are discovered.  If
          proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are
          expensed.  The costs of all development wells and related
          equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are
          capitalized.

          The Company amortizes capitalized costs, including gas gathering
          systems, using a unit-of-production method based on proved oil
          and gas reserves as estimated by independent petroleum engineers. 
          Depreciation on gas transmission plant is computed on a straight-
          line method over thirty years.  Depreciation of other property,
          plant and equipment is computed using principally the straight-
          line method over estimated useful lives of three to thirty years.

          The Company charges the cost of maintenance and repairs to
          expense as incurred.  Betterments are added to property at cost. 
          Utility plant retirements are credited to property, plant and
          equipment at cost and charged to accumulated depreciation, net of
          cost of removal and salvage.  No gain or loss is recognized on
          utility plant retirements. 

          Income Taxes

          Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted the Financial<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 46

          Accounting Standards Board (FASB)  Statement of Financial
          Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income
          Taxes."  As permitted by SFAS No. 109, the Company elected not to
          restate the financial statements of prior years.  SFAS No. 109
          requires the Company to utilize the liability method to recognize
          deferred taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and
          liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
          reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the
          differences are measured at enacted tax rates and laws that will
          be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. 
          Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for future
          changes in tax rates.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 109,
          deferred tax expense was based on items of income and expense
          that were reported in different years in the financial statements
          and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in
          the year the difference originated.  The cumulative effect of
          adopting SFAS No. 109 on the Company and its nonregulated
          subsidiaries was to increase net income approximately $1,562,000
          ($.20 per share) in the first quarter of fiscal 1994.  The
          increase in net income was primarily the result of reduced
          currently enacted tax rates compared to those in effect at the
          time the deferred taxes were previously recognized.  The adoption
          of SFAS No. 109 by Mountaineer resulted in an increase in
          accumulated deferred income taxes which was offset by a
          corresponding increase in a regulatory asset account for  which
          deferred taxes had not previously been recognized due to state
          ratemaking practices.  (See Note 6.)

          Benefits of the Federal income tax credit for fuel produced from
          a non-conventional source are recognized in the consolidated
          financial statements in the period earned to the extent utilized.

          Inventory

          Mountaineer maintains gas in storage under a firm storage service
          agreement with an interstate pipeline.  Gas in storage was
          approximately $14,787,000 and $3,420,000 at June 30, 1994 and
          1993, respectively, and is carried at cost on a first-in, first-
          out basis.

          Oil and gas materials and supplies are stated at the lower of
          cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  Utility materials and
          supplies are stated at average cost and include overheads for
          certain payroll, general and administrative expenses.

          Prepayments

          Prepayments as of June 30, 1993, consisted primarily of advance
          payments for delivery of natural gas supplies to Mountaineer
          during the winter peak usage period.  Such payments are no longer
          required as a result of the implementation of the Federal Energy
          Regulatory Commission's (FERC) Order No. 636.  (See Note 19.) 
          Prepayments are charged to expense in the period the related
          goods or services are rendered.

          Net Income Per Common Share<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 47

          Net income per common share is computed based upon the weighted
          average number of common shares outstanding.

          Weighted average shares for fiscal 1994 and 1993 reflect the
          reduction in shares outstanding resulting from the purchase of
          additional treasury shares.  The Board of Directors has
          authorized the purchase of up to 1,000,000 treasury shares. 
          Subsequent to June 30, 1994, no additional treasury shares have
          been acquired by the Company.

          Cash Flows Presentation

          For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
          Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
          initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

          Reclassifications

          Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
          conform to the 1994 presentation.


          (3)  ACQUISITION

          On March 5, 1993, MGS purchased certain assets of Hallwood
          consisting primarily of natural gas producing properties and
          natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines, all of which
          are located in West Virginia.  MGS began operating such assets
          effective April 1, 1993.  

          The total acquisition cost of approximately $10 million includes
          cash expenditures of approximately $7 million and has been
          accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  The
          purchase price has been allocated to the natural gas properties
          and gathering systems and transmission facilities acquired based
          on their estimated fair values.  The acquisition and purchase
          price allocation was approved by the PSCWV.  Substantially all
          natural gas produced by MGS is sold to Mountaineer based on
          prices approved by the PSCWV.


          (4)  LONG-TERM DEBT

          Long-term debt obligations of the Company at June 30, 1994 and
          1993 were as follows:

          <FN>
          <F1> The Company has a debt agreement which includes a
               $10,000,000 Term Credit and a $5,000,000 Revolving Credit
               facility.  Interest rates under the Term Credit facility are
               either a base rate which approximates the prime rate plus
               1/8% per annum or a certificate of deposit rate plus 1-3/4%
               per annum.  The Term Credit note is required to be repaid in
               consecutive quarterly installments of $375,000 and a
               twentieth and final payment of $2,875,000 at the time of
               maturity, September 30, 1995.  The interest rate on the Term
               Credit Facility was 6.27% at June 30, 1994.

               The Term Credit and Revolving Credit facilities are
               collateralized by all of the outstanding stock of
               Mountaineer and G.A.S. and a lien on certain intercompany
               notes.  The agreement places certain restrictions on the
               ability of the Company to sell its assets, requires the
               maintenance of certain financial covenants and restricts the
               amount of dividends which the Company can declare to twenty-
               five percent of consolidated net income earned after June
               30, 1990.  As of June 30, 1994, the maximum amount of
               dividends which can be declared by the Company is
               approximately $3,473,000.  The financial covenants include a
               minimum adjusted consolidated current ratio, minimum
               consolidated net worth, minimum ratio of consolidated income
               before interest and taxes to consolidated interest on funded
               debt and a ceiling on consolidated funded debt.  As of June
               30, 1994, the Company is in compliance with all required
               financial covenants.

          <F2> Mountaineer has a $15,000,000 Revolving Credit Note
               (Revolving Note) with a bank.  The Revolving Note provides
               that borrowings would not be required to be repaid until
               December 31, 1996.  Mountaineer had no outstanding balance
               on the revolving note as of June 30, 1994.  The interest
               rate is the lower of an adjusted certificate of deposit rate
               or a base rate.  The base rate is equal to the greater of
               the prime rate of interest or the Federal fund rate plus
               1/2%.

               The Revolving Note requires Mountaineer to maintain certain
               financial conditions, including a minimum tangible net
               worth, restrictions on funded debt and restrictions on the
               amount of dividends which can be declared.  As of June 30,
               1994, Mountaineer is in compliance with all required<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 49

               financial covenants.

          <F3> In July 1992, Mountaineer completed a private placement with
               a pension fund of $15,000,000 of unsecured senior notes due
               in 2007.  The terms of the agreement provide that principal
               is to be repaid annually beginning in 1998.  The proceeds
               were used for general corporate purposes and to repay the
               existing Revolving Credit Note.  The interest rate on the
               pension fund notes is 8.71% and is due semi-annually.  The
               financial covenants are similar to the terms of the notes
               payable to the insurance companies.

          <F4> The notes payable to insurance companies require (a) annual
               principal payments beginning June 30, 1993, through June 30,
               2002, at which time the notes are due in full and (b)
               interest at 9.75% due semi-annually.  These notes require
               Mountaineer to maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth
               and restrict the amount of dividends that Mountaineer can
               declare to the Company.

               As of June 30, 1994, Mountaineer had approximately $11.7
               million available for declaration of dividends under the
               terms of its debt agreements.

          (5)  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES-OF-CREDIT

          Mountaineer had unsecured short-term bank lines-of-credit
          totaling $57.5 million, $30 million and $22.5 million in fiscal
          1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  During fiscal 1994, the<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 50

          maximum outstanding daily balance was $37,220,700 and the average
          daily balance was $17,156,300.  The weighted average interest
          rate was 3.44% on the balance outstanding in fiscal 1994.  During
          fiscal 1993, the maximum outstanding daily balance was $9,243,800
          and the average daily balance was $1,407,000.  The weighted
          average interest rate was 3.40% on the balance outstanding in
          fiscal 1993.  During fiscal 1992, the maximum outstanding daily
          balance was $44,000 and the average daily balance was $400.  The
          weighted average interest rate was 5.3% on the balance
          outstanding in fiscal 1992.   There was $18,702,900 and
          $7,638,700 outstanding on these lines-of-credit at June 30, 1994
          and 1993, respectively.  The interest rate on these borrowings at
          June 30, 1994 and 1993 was 4.8% and 3.3%, respectively.  There
          were no outstanding borrowings on these lines-of-credit at June
          30, 1992.

          Allegheny has $5,000,000 available under the Revolving Credit
          Agreement entered into in September 1990.  The interest rate is
          either a base rate which approximates the prime rate or a
          certificate of deposit rate plus 1-1/2% per annum.  No borrowings
          were made on this facility in fiscal 1994, 1993 or 1992.

          (6)  TAXES ON INCOME

          Effective July 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted SFAS
          No. 109.  SFAS No. 109 requires the Company to utilize the
          liability method to recognize deferred taxes.  Under this method,
          deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on differences
          between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
          liabilities and the differences are measured at enacted tax rates
          and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected
          to reverse.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for
          future changes in tax rates.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
          109, deferred taxes were measured using tax rates for the year in
          which timing differences arose and were not adjusted for changes
          in tax rates.

          The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 on the Company and
          its nonregulated subsidiaries as of July 1, 1993, was to increase
          net income approximately $1,562,000 ($.20 per share) in the first
          quarter of fiscal 1994.  The increase in net income was primarily
          the result of reduced currently enacted tax rates compared to
          those in effect at the time the deferred taxes were recognized. 
          Pre-tax income from continuing operations of the Company and its
          nonregulated subsidiaries was not affected by the change in the
          method of accounting for income taxes.  The adoption of SFAS No.
          109 by Mountaineer resulted in an increase in accumulated
          deferred income taxes which was offset by a corresponding
          increase in a regulatory asset to account for certain temporary
          differences for which deferred taxes had not previously been
          recognized due to state ratemaking practices.  This amount
          (approximately $8,539,000 at June 30, 1994) has been reflected in
          other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.

          Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and
          liabilities as of June 30, 1994 are as follows:<PAGE>

          In August 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 was
          enacted into law which, among other changes, increased the top
          marginal tax rate for corporations with taxable incomes in excess
          of $10 million to 35%.  The Company does not currently anticipate
          that it will be subject to the increased marginal rate.

          (7)  RETIREMENT PLANS

          The Retirement Income Plan for the Company (the Plan) covers all
          qualified employees 21 years of age and over.  Employees become
          fully vested upon completion of five years of credited service,
          as defined by the Plan.  Retirement income is based on credited
          years of service and level of compensation.  The Plan is subject
          to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
          of 1974 (ERISA).  The determination of contributions is made in
          consultation with an actuary and is based upon anticipated<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 53

          earnings of the Plan, mortality and turnover experience, the
          funded status of the Plan and anticipated future compensation
          levels.  The Company's funding policy is to be in compliance with
          ERISA guidelines and to make annual contributions to the Plan to
          assure that all employees' benefits will be fully provided for by
          the time they retire.  Funds contributed to the Plan have been
          invested primarily in government securities and corporate bonds
          and equity securities of large, well-established corporations.

          The following table sets forth the Plan's funded status and
          amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets
          at June 30, 1994 and 1993:

          The expected long-term rate of return used in the calculations
          was 8.25% for fiscal 1994 and 1993 and 9% for fiscal 1992.  The
          weighted average discount rate used in the calculations was 8.0%
          for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992.

          The Company has a Key Executives' Supplemental Retirement Benefit
          Plan (the "SERP") for its key executive employees.  The SERP
          provides for the payment of compensation for varying periods of
          time upon an executive employee reaching a specified retirement
          age or becoming permanently disabled while employed by the
          Company or its subsidiaries.  The Company funds the SERP through
          the purchase of individual life insurance contracts of which the
          Company is the sole beneficiary, and the specific level of
          compensation will be dependent upon the performance of the life
          insurance contracts.  In addition, the Company will provide
          benefits to the employee's beneficiary should the employee die
          while employed by the Company or its subsidiaries.  Benefits to
          be paid upon retirement will not vest unless the employee
          continues to be employed by the Company or its subsidiaries
          through the specified retirement age.  Should a change in control
          (as defined in the SERP) of the Company occur, the employee will
          become entitled to a portion of his retirement benefit for each
          year of participation in the SERP, except for certain executives
          having employment contracts, who will be entitled to full
          retirement benefits.  This portion is based upon the number of
          years of participation in the SERP in proportion to the total
          number of years until retirement for such employee from the time
          he or she became a participant in the SERP.  The Board of
          Directors, in its sole discretion, may terminate the SERP at any
          time, in whole or in part.  The costs associated with the SERP
          are being accrued over the respective executive employee's
          remaining years of service to retirement.

          (8)  POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

          Mountaineer provides certain medical and life insurance benefits
          for retired employees. Substantially all of Mountaineer's
          employees may become eligible for these benefits if they choose
          to retire early after reaching age 55 while working for
          Mountaineer.  The medical benefits are provided until age 65 at
          which time these employees become eligible for Medicare and
          medical benefits from Mountaineer are no longer provided. Life
          insurance benefits of approximately two times annual salary are
          provided while an employee is active and working at Mountaineer. 
          On the date of an employee's retirement and on the date the<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 55

          employee reaches age 70, life insurance benefits decrease to
          approximately 80% and 40% of annual salary, respectively.  These
          benefits are provided to retirees who meet the service
          requirements of ten continuous years of service prior to
          retirement at age 55 or five continuous years of service prior to
          retirement at age 65.  

          Effective July 1, 1993, Mountaineer adopted SFAS No. 106,
          "Employers  Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
          Pensions" (OPEB).  SFAS No. 106 significantly changes the
          accounting, measurement and disclosure practices with respect to
          OPEB's.  SFAS No. 106 requires that the expected cost of OPEB's
          be charged to expense during the period of an employee's service
          rather than expensing such costs as claims are incurred.  Under
          the plan, the attribution period is equivalent to the 10-year
          period prior to the employee reaching eligible retirement age. 
          As permitted by SFAS No. 106, Mountaineer has elected to amortize
          the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation existing at the
          date of adoption ("transition obligation") over a 20-year period. 
          Prior to fiscal 1994, Mountaineer recognized postretirement
          health care and life insurance benefits in the year the benefits
          were paid.  The cost of retirees' benefits paid in fiscal 1994,
          1993 and 1992 was approximately $297,000, $525,000 and $347,000,
          respectively.  Retiree benefits recognized by Mountaineer
          pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 106 were $1,117,000 in
          fiscal 1994.

          The following table sets forth the plan's funded status, as
          determined by an independent actuary, as of July 1, 1993 and June
          30, 1994:

          The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the
          accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 11% in 1994,
          declining gradually to 5.5% in 2005 and remaining at that level
          thereafter.  The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
          significant effect on the amounts reported.  To illustrate,
          increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
          percent in each year would increase the aggregated service and
          interest cost by $49,000 and accumulated postretirement benefit
          obligation as of June 30, 1994 by $218,000.  The weighted average
          discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
          benefit obligation was 8%.  The average assumed annual rate of
          salary increase for the life insurance benefit plan was 5%.

          As part of a PSCWV rate order dated October 29, 1993, the PSCWV
          ruled that the permitted rate recovery mechanism for OPEB's will
          be a modified accrual method.  The modified accrual method allows
          for the recovery of current service costs on an accrual basis and
          recovery of the transition obligation on a cash basis. 
          Accounting for the transition obligation on a cash method is not
          an acceptable accounting method under generally accepted
          accounting principles.  Mountaineer is recording its other
          postretirement benefit expense in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
          which is in excess of the permitted rate recovery as a result of
          the PSCWV's ruling.  Mountaineer currently estimates that the
          amount of SFAS No. 106 expense (net of those amounts expected to
          be capitalized) in excess of the modified accrual basis would be
          approximately $300,000 in fiscal 1995 and would accumulate to
          approximately $3,000,000 over the remaining nineteen year
          amortization period for transition costs.  These amounts will be
          recovered through rates in later years when the cash basis of
          prior service costs exceeds the accrual basis of such costs.

          (9)  LEASING ARRANGEMENTS

          The Company, primarily through its subsidiary, Mountaineer,
          leases buildings, office space, and equipment under various
          short-term and long-term agreements.  Total expense for leases<PAGE>

          (10) STOCK OPTION PLAN

          The Company's 1987 Stock Option Plan (the 1987 Plan), as amended,
          provides that a combined total of 1,500,000 incentive and non-
          qualified options to purchase shares of the Company's common
          stock may be granted to certain key employees by the Board of
          Directors.  Incentive options must be granted with an exercise
          price equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock
          on the date of grant.  Non-qualified options may be granted at
          prices determined by the Board of Directors.  Options granted
          expire five to ten years from date of grant and may include
          vesting provisions; however, in the event of a change in control
          of the Company (as defined in the 1987 Plan), options granted
          vest immediately.  The 1987 Plan also provides that employees may
          be granted stock appreciation rights (SAR's) at the discretion of
          the Board of Directors.  No SAR's have been granted under the
          1987 Plan.

          </TABLE>

          The increase in revenues from oil and gas producing activities is
          due primarily to MGS's natural gas sales being in place for all
          of fiscal 1994 versus only three months of fiscal 1993.

          Production costs include those costs incurred to operate and
          maintain productive wells and related equipment and include costs
          such as labor, repairs and maintenance, materials, supplies, fuel
          consumed, insurance and production taxes.  In addition,
          production costs include certain administrative expenses which
          the Company determines are directly related to oil and gas
          operations, and are net of well tending fees which are included
          in field service revenues in the accompanying consolidated income
          statements.  The increase in production costs in fiscal 1994 is
          due primarily to MGS's operations being in place for all of
          fiscal 1994 versus only three months of fiscal 1993.  The
          reduction in production expenses in fiscal 1993 reflects the
          discontinuance of TEX-HEX operations and the efforts to reduce
          field operations expenses at Allegheny.

          Exploration expenses include the costs of geological and
          geophysical activity, carrying and retaining undeveloped
          property, dry holes and leasehold impairment allowances.  

          Depletion, depreciation, and amortization expense includes costs
          associated with capitalized acquisition, exploration, and
          development costs, and the depreciation applicable to support
          equipment.  

          The income tax benefit is computed at the statutory Federal and
          state income tax rate and is reduced to the extent of permanent
          differences, which have been recognized in the Company's tax
          provision, including the utilization of Federal tax credits
          permitted for fuel produced from a non-conventional source.

          </TABLE>

          These estimates are based primarily on the reports of independent
          petroleum engineers.  The estimates include only those amounts
          considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional
          amounts that may result from extensions of currently proved areas
          or amounts that may result from new discoveries in the future. 
          Proved developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to
          be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
          operating methods.

          In fiscal 1992, the Company changed the method by which it
          computes its net proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to
          the Company's interest in producing properties in which other
          third parties participate.  Beginning in fiscal 1992, the Company
          determines the economic life of such reserves based, in part,
          upon operating costs that include general and administrative
          expenses charged to such properties.  Prior to fiscal 1992, the
          Company excluded such expenses when determining economic life. 
          The impact of this change reduced the economic life, which, in
          turn, reduced the estimated reserves.  This change resulted in a
          reduction of approximately 2,400,000 Mcf in natural gas reserves
          and 16,000 Bbl in oil reserves, which is reflected in the above
          table within the fiscal 1992 revision of previous estimates.<PAGE>

          (15)   STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS
                 AND CHANGES THEREIN RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS
                 RESERVES (UNAUDITED)

          Summarized in the table below is information for the Company with
          respect to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
          flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.  Future cash
          inflows are derived by applying current oil and gas prices to
          estimated future production.  Future production costs, likewise,
          are derived based on current costs, assuming continuation of
          existing economic conditions.  Future income tax expenses are
          computed at the Company's anticipated statutory tax rate in
          effect at the end of each fiscal year to the future pre-tax net
          cash flows, less the tax basis of the properties, and gives
          effect to permanent differences and tax credits related to the
          properties.  The future income tax expense reflected below
          excludes the benefit of the Federal tax credit available from
          production of fuel from non-conventional sources.  Utilization of
          the tax credit is permitted to the extent the Company is in a
          regular tax-paying position.  Future income tax expense may be
          lower to the extent the tax credit is utilized.

          It is necessary to emphasize that the data presented above should
          not be viewed as representing the expected cash flow from, or
          current value of, existing proved reserves since the computations
          are based on a large number of estimates and arbitrary
          assumptions.  Reserve quantities cannot be measured with
          precision and their estimation requires many judgmental
          determinations and frequent revisions.  The required projection
          of production and related expenditures over time requires further
          assumptions with respect to pipeline availability, rates of
          demand, and governmental control, among other factors. 
          Furthermore, actual future prices and costs are likely to be
          substantially different from the current prices and costs
          utilized in the computation of reported amounts.  In addition,
          the reported data are applicable only to oil and gas reserves
          classified as proved; no amounts are included with respect to
          additional reserves that may become proved in the future.  Any
          analysis or evaluation of the reported amounts should give
          specific recognition to the computational methods utilized and
          the limitations inherent therein.

          The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
          fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is
          practicable to estimate fair value:

            Cash and equivalents, accounts receivable and short-term     
              borrowings:  The carrying amounts approximate fair value due  
              to the nature and short-term maturity of these instruments.

            Short-term investments:  Fair value is based on quoted market   
              prices.

            Long-term debt:  Fair value is estimated using discounted cash  
              flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates
              for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

          In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, Mountaineer recorded a $17
          million charge to revenues relating to Mountaineer's passthrough
          to its customers of refunds received from Mountaineer's pipeline
          suppliers. This charge was offset by a corresponding reduction in
          cost of gas distributed, resulting in no impact on the Company's
          profitability.

          Mountaineer's natural gas distribution operations are
          significantly affected by weather-related heating requirements. 
          Therefore, results for interim periods are not comparable and are
          not necessarily indicative of what may be expected for a full
          year.

          The Company records an interim provision (benefit) for income
          taxes based upon its estimated annual effective rate. 
          Differences between net statutory rates and effective rates are
          caused primarily by book amortization of an acquisition
          adjustment, Federal nonconventional fuel credits and the
          treatment of certain temporary differences for ratemaking<PAGE>

          (19) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

          Gas Transmission Matters

          In 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 et. seq., (the 636
          Orders).  The 636 Orders required substantial restructuring of
          the service obligations of interstate pipelines.  Among other
          things, the 636 Orders mandated "unbundling" of existing pipeline
          gas sales services and replaced existing statutory abandonment
          procedures, as applied to firm transportation contracts of more
          than one year, with a right-of-first-refusal mechanism. 
          Mandatory unbundling required pipelines to sell separately the
          various components of their previous gas sales services
          (gathering, transportation and storage services, and gas supply). 
          To address concerns raised by utilities about reliability of
          service to their service territories, the 636 Orders required
          pipelines to offer a no-notice transportation service in which
          firm transporters can receive delivery of gas up to their
          contractual capacity level on any day without prior scheduling. 
          In addition, the 636 Orders provided for a mechanism for
          pipelines to recover prudently incurred transition costs
          associated with the restructuring process.

          All of Mountaineer's pipeline suppliers have filed their
          restructuring plans with the FERC.  The FERC has reviewed these
          plans; however, there are several issues which remain subject to
          further action by either the FERC or reviewing courts, including
          the ultimate sharing of transition costs, the level of no-notice
          protection and the impact on service reliability, and rate design
          implementation.  Mountaineer's largest pipeline supplier,
          Columbia Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission),
          received orders from the FERC which approved its proposed
          restructuring filing with certain modifications.  One of the FERC
          modifications prohibited Columbia Transmission from recovering
          contract rejection claims it may incur in its bankruptcy
          proceeding as part of its transition costs.  Columbia
          Transmission and others have filed for appellate review of this
          disallowance.  In addition, Columbia Transmission filed a revised
          compliance plan with the FERC on October 22, 1993, which was
          placed into effect on November 1, 1993, subject to further
          modification.

          As a consequence of the November 1, 1993 restructuring,
          Mountaineer has replaced the bundled firm sales service it
          previously received from Columbia Transmission with gas purchase
          arrangements negotiated with unregulated suppliers and firm
          transportation and storage agreements with Columbia Transmission. 
          Interim supply arrangements are in place, negotiations for long-
          term supplies are underway and the Company is reviewing its
          current level of firm service contracts to determine if
          additional capacity is necessary to provide reliable service to
          its customers.  Unresolved issues include whether the new
          unbundled transportation and storage services provided by
          Columbia Transmission, and the replacement natural gas supplies
          provided by others, will result in the same degree of service<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 67

          reliability as the bundled firm sales service Columbia
          Transmission has provided to Mountaineer in the past.  Because of
          these issues and others, Mountaineer has petitioned for appellate
          review of both the 636 Orders and the orders approving the
          implementation of Columbia Transmission's restructuring pursuant
          to the 636 Orders.  Mountaineer's management continues to
          actively participate in Columbia Transmission's compliance
          filings in order to protect Mountaineer's interests, ensure the
          continued reliability of service to its customers and minimize
          future transition costs.  

          Until Mountaineer's pipeline suppliers' rate filings to implement
          restructuring, including subsequent filings to recover 
          transition costs, are fully approved by the FERC, the ultimate
          amount of the costs associated with restructuring cannot be
          ascertained. However, Mountaineer's management anticipates that
          the amount of restructuring costs that will be passed through to
          Mountaineer will be significant.  Mountaineer will attempt to
          obtain approval from the PSCWV to recover any such approved
          restructuring costs from its customers.  On the basis of previous
          state regulatory proceedings involving the recovery of gas
          purchase costs and take-or-pay obligations, Mountaineer believes
          that the costs passed through from its pipeline suppliers will be
          recovered from ratepayers, although there can be no assurance
          that this will be the case.

          On July 31, 1991, Columbia Transmission and The Columbia Gas
          System, Inc. (the Columbia Companies) filed for protection under
          Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Columbia Companies stated
          that the primary basis for their filing was the failure of
          Columbia Transmission to acquire natural gas through existing
          producer contracts under terms and conditions, including price,
          which would permit Columbia Transmission to compete in the
          marketplace.  Columbia Transmission's filing could affect its
          relationship with Mountaineer.  Although Mountaineer only
          purchased 1% of its gas supplies from Columbia Transmission
          during fiscal 1994, Mountaineer relies upon Columbia Transmission
          for the delivery of a majority of Mountaineer's gas supplies. 

          On January 18, 1994, Columbia Transmission filed a proposed plan
          of reorganization in the bankruptcy proceedings, but requested
          the Bankruptcy Court to defer all further proceedings on such
          plan pending further discussions with Columbia Transmission's
          major creditors and official committees, including the official
          committee of customers which Mountaineer chairs.  The plan, if
          ultimately approved by the Bankruptcy Court and accepted by
          Columbia Transmission's customers, would inter alia, (i) pay
          Columbia Transmission's customers 100% of certain refund amounts
          ordered by the FERC, but at a lower interest rate than provided
          by the FERC, (ii) pay Columbia Transmission's customers 90% of
          certain other refunds ordered by the FERC, and (iii) require any
          customer accepting the plan to waive its entitlement to all other
          refund amounts and to not oppose Columbia Transmission's recovery
          from such customers of approximately $250 million in certain
          costs to be filed with the FERC.  Discussions on the proposed
          plan are at a preliminary stage and Columbia Transmission is in
          the process of providing additional information necessary to<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 68

          evaluate the proposal.  However, at this stage, various aspects
          of the proposal appear unacceptable to the official committee of
          customers.  

          In addition, the United States Court of Appeals of the District
          of Columbia Circuit recently granted an appeal filed by
          Mountaineer and others which challenged Columbia Transmission's
          right to recover through FERC-approved rates over $120 million in
          take-or-pay costs from its customers.  Once the court s decision
          becomes final, the case will be remanded to the FERC for further
          proceedings to determine the level of refunds owed Columbia
          Transmission's customers.  The refund amount determined may have
          a significant bearing on Columbia Transmission's proposed plan of
          reorganization and any negotiated resolution thereof.

          Mountaineer is vigorously opposing Columbia Transmission's
          efforts to recover costs related to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy
          proceedings.  The outcome of these proceedings could materially
          affect Mountaineer's prices to its customers.  Mountaineer is
          reviewing its options, including the level of Columbia
          Transmission's role in providing service to Mountaineer in the
          future.  Mountaineer's management continues to be actively
          involved in this process in order to minimize any adverse impact
          on the interests of Mountaineer or its customers.

          Legal Matters

          Cameron Gas Company and C. Richard Coleman, et al. vs. Allegheny
          & Western Energy Corporation, Mountaineer Gas Company and Gas
          Access Systems, Inc. was filed on December 31, 1992, in the
          Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia.  Plaintiffs
          allege unlawful and/or tortious conduct and violations of the
          Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and the
          West Virginia Anti-Trust Act, arising out of the termination of a
          gas sales agreement and seek $30 million compensatory damages and
          $90 million punitive damages.  Upon the petition of the Company,
          the case was removed to the United States District Court for the
          Northern District of West Virginia.  On February 19, 1993, the
          Company filed responsive dispositive pleadings to the complaint,
          including a motion to dismiss.  By Order issued March 31, 1994,
          and clarified by Order issued April 18, 1994, the West Virginia
          anti-trust claim against Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation,
          Mountaineer Gas Company and Gas Access Systems, Inc. was
          dismissed with prejudice.  In addition, the RICO claim was
          dismissed against Allegheny & Western Energy Corporation with
          prejudice.  On April 14, 1994, Mountaineer filed a general denial
          to plaintiffs' complaint and a counterclaim seeking at least
          $150,000 in compensatory and $2.0 million in punitive damages for
          the willful withholding by Cameron of monies collected by Cameron
          as agent for certain of the Company's customers and intended to
          be paid to the Company for services rendered by the Company.  In
          response to the April 18, 1994 Order, the plaintiffs filed an
          amended complaint to which the Company has filed responsive
          pleadings, including a motion to dismiss, and a counterclaim. 
          The pleadings remain pending before the Court for disposition. 
          Discovery has commenced.  No trial date has been set.  The
          Company believes Cameron's claims are without merit and plans to<PAGE>



          <PAGE> 69

          vigorously defend this matter and does not believe that this
          matter is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
          the financial position and results of operations of the Company.

          The Company has been named as a defendant in various other legal
          actions which arise primarily in the ordinary course of business. 
          In management's opinion, these outstanding claims are unlikely to
          result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
          position and results of operations.

          AWENZ and its partner posted a performance bond of NZ $500,000
          (US $297,500 as of June 30, 1994), which is a normal requirement
          of the Minister of Energy.  Should AWENZ and its partner not
          perform their commitments as required by the license, the
          government of New Zealand could elect to call the bonds, which
          would require the payment by AWENZ of 59.5% of such amount.  To
          the best of management's knowledge, all such commitments
          currently required by the licenses have been performed.

          Rate Matters

          On March 30, 1994, the PSCWV issued a final order which put
          Mountaineer on notice that in its next rate case, any savings
          generated by Mountaineer's participation in a consolidated tax
          return would be passed through to Mountaineer's ratepayers unless
          persuasive legal or accounting arguments are presented to the
          PSCWV to convince them to act otherwise.  Management is unable to
          determine what impact the consolidated tax savings issue will
          have on Mountaineer's future results of operations.  

          (20)   ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT EFFECTIVE

          In November 1992, the FASB issued SFAS No. 112 "Employers
          Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  This statement requires
          employers to recognize any obligation which exists to provide
          benefits to former or inactive employees after employment, but
          before retirement. Such benefits include, but are not limited to,
          salary continuations, supplemental unemployment, severance
          disability (including workers' compensation), job training,
          counseling and continuation of benefits such as health care and
          life insurance.  Currently, the Company provides only for
          workers' compensation benefits which would qualify as
          postemployment benefits under this standard.  

          The Company will adopt this statement in fiscal 1995.  The
          adoption of SFAS No. 112 is not expected to have a material
          impact on the Company's results of operations.

          secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each

          shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  If

          mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when

          deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder

          at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the

          Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.


                     Section 5.  Closing of Transfer Books or Fixing of

          Record Date.  For the purpose of determining shareholders

          entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders

          or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 3

          payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of

          shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors

          of the Corporation may provide that the stock transfer books

          shall be closed for a stated period but not to exceed, in any

          case, 50 days.  If the stock transfer books shall be closed for

          the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or

          to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall be closed

          for at least ten days immediately preceding such meeting.  In

          lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the board of directors

          may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such

          determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not

          more than 50 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not

          less than ten days prior to the date on which the particular

          action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be

          taken.  If the stock transfer books are not closed and no record

          date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to

          notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or

          shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date

          on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the

          resolution of the board of directors declaring such dividend is

          adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such

          determination of shareholders.  When a determination of

          shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has

          been made as provided in this section, such determination shall

          apply to any adjournment thereof.


                     Section 6.  Voting Record.  The officer or agent

          having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the

          Corporation shall make a complete record of the shareholders

          entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof,<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 4

          arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the

          number of shares held by each, which list shall be kept on file

          at the office of the Corporation and shall be subject to

          inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business

          hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the

          time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the

          inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the

          meeting.  The original stock transfer book shall be prima facie

          evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such

          list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.


                     Section 7.  Quorum.  A majority of the outstanding

          shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person

          or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of

          shareholders.  If less than a majority of the outstanding shares

          are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so

          represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without

          further notice.  At any reconvening of such previously adjourned

          meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any

          business may be transacted which might have been transacted at

          the meeting as originally notified.  The shareholders present at

          a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until

          adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough

          shareholders to leave less than a quorum.


                     Section 8.  Proxies.  At all meetings of shareholders,

          a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the

          shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact.  Such

          proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the Corporation before

          or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 5

          eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise

          provided in the proxy.


                     Section 9.  Voting of Shares.   Subject to the

          provisions of Section 11 of this Article II, each outstanding

          share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote upon each

          matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders.


                     Section 10.  Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. 

          Shares standing in the name of another Corporation, domestic or

          foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the

          bylaws of such other Corporation may prescribe or, in the absence

          of such provision, as the board of directors of such other

          Corporation may determine.

                     Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian,

          committee, curator, or conservator may be voted by him, either in

          person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his

          name.  Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by

          him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be

          entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such

          shares into his name.

                     Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted

          by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a

          receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer

          thereof into his name if authority so to do be contained in an

          appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was

          appointed.

                     A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be

          entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been

          transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 6

          pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

                     On and after the date on which written notice of

          redemption of redeemable shares has been mailed to the holders

          thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem such shares has been

          deposited with a bank or trust company with irrevocable

          instruction and authority to pay the redemption price to the

          holders thereof upon surrender of certificates therefor, such

          shares shall not be entitled to vote on any matter and shall not

          be deemed to be outstanding shares.


                     Section 11.  Cumulative Voting.  At each election for

          directors every shareholder entitled to vote at such election

          shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number

          of shares owned by him for as many persons as there are directors

          to be elected and for whose election he has a right to vote, or

          to cumulate his votes by giving one candidate as many votes as

          the number of such directors multiplied by the number of his

          shares shall equal, or by distributing such votes on the same

          principle among any number of candidates.


                     Section 12.  Meeting by Electronic Communication.  One

          or more shareholders may participate in a meeting of the

          shareholders by means of conference telephone or similar

          electronic communications equipment by means of which all persons

          participating in the meeting can hear each other.  Whenever a

          vote of the shareholders is required or permitted in connection

          with any corporate action this vote may be taken orally during

          this conference.  The agreement thus reached shall have like

          effect and validity as though the action were duly taken by the

          action of the shareholders at a meeting of shareholders if the<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 7

          agreement is reduced to writing and approved by the shareholders

          at the next regular meeting of the shareholders after the

          conference.


                     Section 13.  Informal Action. Whenever the vote of

          shareholders or members at a meeting thereof is required or

          permitted to be taken in connection with any corporate action,

          the meeting and vote of the shareholders or members may be

          dispensed with if all of the shareholders or members who would

          have been entitled to vote upon the action agree in writing to

          the corporate action being taken.  The agreement shall have like

          effect and validity as though the action were duly taken by the

          unanimous action of all shareholders or members entitled to vote

          at a meeting of the shareholders or members duly called and

          legally held.


                          Article III.  Board of Directors.


                     Section 1.  General Powers.  The business and affairs

          of the Corporation shall be managed by its board of directors.



                     Section 2.  Number, Election, Tenure and Quali-

          fications.  The number of directors of the Corporation shall be

          seven (7) or such other number not to exceed fourteen (14) as the

          board of directors may establish by resolution.  The director or

          directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of

          shareholders and until his or their successor or successors has

          or shall have been elected and qualified.  Directors need not be

          residents of the State of West Virginia or a shareholder of the

          Corporation.<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 8

                     Section 3.  Regular Meetings.  A regular meeting of 

          the board of directors shall be held without other notice than

          this bylaw immediately after, and at the same place as, the

          annual meeting of shareholders.  The board of directors may

          provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or

          without the State of West Virginia for the holding of additional

          regular meetings without other notice than such resolution.


                     Section 4.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the

          board of directors may be held at any time by the call of the

          president or any two (2) directors.  The person or persons

          authorized to call special meetings of the board of directors may

          fix any place, either within or without the State of West

          Virginia, as the place for holding any special meeting of the

          board of directors called by them.


                     Section 5. Notice.  Notice of any special meeting

          shall be given by written notice delivered personally, by mail,

          or by telegram to each director at his business address as

          appearing in the records of the Corporation.  Notice shall be

          deemed to be delivered when received at the address of the

          director and must be given at least two (2) days prior to the

          meeting.  The presence of any director at a meeting shall

          constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting as to that

          director, except when a director attends a meeting for the

          express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business

          because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither

          the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular

          or special meeting of the board of directors need be specified in

          the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting except that such<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 9

          notice must set forth the nature of the business intended to be

          transacted if such business is (a) amending the bylaws or

          (b) authorizing the sale of all or substantially all of the

          assets of the Corporation.


                     Section 6.  Quorum.  A majority of the number of

          directors fixed by Section 2 of this Article III shall constitute

          a quorum of the transaction of business at any meeting of the

          board of directors, but if less than such majority is present at

          a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the

          meeting from time to time without further notice.


                     Section 7.  Manner of Acting.  The act of the majority

          of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is

          present shall be the act of the board of directors; provided,

          however, that in the event any matter should come before the

          board of directors as to which one of the directors has or may

          have a conflict of interest, said director shall abstain from

          voting thereon, and the remaining director or directors, as the

          case may be, shall have full and complete authority to consider

          and vote upon such matter, and such vote shall be binding upon

          the Corporation.


                     Section 8.  Vacancies.  Any vacancy occurring in the

          board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a

          majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of

          the board of directors.  A director elected to fill a vacancy

          shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in

          office.  Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase

          in the number of directors may be filled by the board of

          directors at their regular meeting or at a special meeting called<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 10

          for that purpose, for a term of office continuing only until the

          next election of directors.


                     Section 9.  Compensation.  By resolution of the board

          of directors, the directors may be paid their expenses, if any,

          of attendance at each meeting of the board of directors, and may

          be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the board

          of directors or a stated salary as director.  No such payment

          shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any

          other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.


                     Section 10.  Presumption of Assent.  A director of the

          Corporation who is present at a meeting of the board of directors

          at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be

          presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his dissent

          shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall

          file his written dissent to such action with the person acting as

          the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or

          shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the secretary of

          the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. 

          Such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in

          favor of such action.


                     Section 11.  Meeting by Electronic Communication.  One

          or more directors may participate in a meeting of the directors

          by means of conference telephone or similar electronic

          communications equipment by means of which all persons

          participating in the meeting can hear each other.  Whenever a

          vote of the directors is required or permitted in connection with

          any corporate action this vote may be taken orally during this

          conference.  The agreement thus reached shall have like effect<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 11

          and validity as though the action were duly taken by the action

          of the directors at a meeting of directors if the agreement is

          reduced to writing and approved by the directors at the next

          regular meeting of the directors after the conference. 


                     Section 12.  Informal Action.  Whenever the vote of

          directors at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be

          taken in connection with any corporate action, the meeting and

          vote of the directors may be dispensed with if all the directors

          agree in writing to the corporate action being taken.  The

          agreement shall have like effect and validity as though the

          actions were duly taken by the unanimous action of all directors

          at a meeting of the directors duly called and legally held.


                               Article IV. Committees.


                     Section 1.  Executive Committee.   The board of

          directors may, in its discretion, by resolution adopted by a

          majority of the whole board, constitute a general executive

          committee for the board, appoint the members thereof, who shall

          be board members, and specify its authority and responsibility. 

          Members of said committee shall serve at the pleasure of the

          board.  The executive committee shall have such powers and shall

          perform such duties as the board may delegate to it in writing

          from time to time, including the immediate oversight and

          management of the business affairs of the Corporation, except

          that the committee shall have no power to declare dividends or to

          adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation.

                     The executive committee shall be organized and shall

          perform its functions as directed by the board and shall report

          periodically to the board.  The committee shall act by a majority<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 12

          of the members thereof, and any action duly taken by the

          executive committee within the course and scope of its authority

          shall be binding on the Corporation.

                     The executive committee may be abolished at any time

          by the vote of a majority of the board of directors at any

          meeting of the board, and during the course of the committee's

          existence, the membership thereof may be increased or decreased

          and the authority and duties of the committee changed by the

          board of directors as it may deem appropriate.

                The Chairman of the Executive Committee shall be appointed

          from time to time by the Board of Directors, and the Secretary of

          the Corporation shall act as Secretary thereof.  In the absence

          from any meeting of the Executive Committee of its Chairman, the

          President of the Corporation, if then present, shall act as

          Chairman of the meeting, and in the absence of the President, the

          Committee shall appoint a Chairman of the meeting.  In the

          absence from any meeting of the Executive Committee of its

          Secretary, the Executive Committee shall appoint a Secretary of

          the meeting.


                Section 2.  Other Committees.  The board of directors,

          at its discretion, may constitute and appoint special committees,

          in addition to the executive committee, to assist in the

          supervision, management, and control of the affairs of the

          Corporation, with responsibilities and powers appropriate to the

          nature of the several committees and as provided by the board of

          directors in the resolution of appointment or in subsequent

          resolutions and directives.  The membersof each committee so

          constituted and appointed by the board shall serve at the

          pleasure of the board of Directors.<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 13

                     In addition to such obligations and functions as may

          be expressly provided for by the board of directors, each

          committee so constituted and appointed by the board shall from

          time to time report to and advise the board on corporate affairs

          within its particular area of responsibility and interest.


                                Article V.  Officers.


                     Section 1.  Number.  The officers of the Corporation

          shall be President, Secretary, and Treasurer, each of whom shall

          be elected by the board of directors.  Such other officers and

          assistant officers, such as Vice President and Chairman of the

          Board, as may be deemed necessary, may be elected or appointed by

          the board of directors.  Any two or more offices may be held by

          the same person, except the offices of president and secretary.

          of the Corporation to be elected by the board of directors shall

          be elected annually by the board of directors at the first

          meeting of the board of directors held after each annual meeting

          of the shareholders.  If the election of officers shall not be

          held at such meeting, such election shall be held as soon

          thereafter as conveniently may be.  Each officer shall hold

          office until his successor shall have been duly elected and shall

          have qualified or until his death or until he shall resign or

          shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided.


                     Section 3.  Removal.  Any officer or agent elected or

          appointed by the board of directors may be removed by the board

          of directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the

          Corporation would be served thereby.  Election or appointment of<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 14

          an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.


                     Section 4.  Vacancies.   A vacancy in any office

          because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or

          otherwise, may be filled by the board of directors for the

          unexpired portion of the term.


                     Section 5.  Chairman of the Board.  The chairman of

          the board shall preside at all meetings of the board of directors

          and of the shareholders at which he shall be present.  He shall

          have and may exercise such powers and perform such other duties

          as are, from time to time, assigned to him by the board and as

          may be provided by law.


                     Section 6.  President.   The president shall be the

          principal executive officer of the Corporation and, subject to

          the control of the board of directors, shall in general supervise

                     Section 10.  Assistant Officers. The board of

          directors shall have the power, in its discretion, to appoint any

          qualified person to act as assistant to any officer of the

          Corporation.  Such assistant shall perform such duties as the

          board shall prescribe, including the performance of the duties of

          the principal officer when the incumbent is unable to act or it

          is impractical for him to act personally, subject to any

          restrictions on such authority as may be imposed by the board. 

          The acts of such assistant officer, within the scope of his

          authorize any officer or officers, agent or agents, to enter into

          any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of

          and on behalf of the Corporation, and such authority may be

          behalf of the Corporation and evidences of indebtedness shall be

          issued in its name in such manner as shall from time to time be

              Article VII.  Certificates for Shares and their Transfer.


                     Section 1.  Certificates for Shares.   Certificates

          representing shares of the Corporation shall be in such form as

          shall be determined by the board of directors.  Such certificates

          shall be signed by the president or a vice president and by the

          secretary.   All certificates for shares shall be consecutively<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 18

          numbered or otherwise identified.  The name and address of the

          person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with

          the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the

          stock transfer books of the Corporation.  All certificates

          surrendered to the Corporation for transfer shall be cancelled

          and no new certificate shall be issued until the former

          certificate for a like number of shares shall have been

          surrendered and cancelled, except that in case of a lost,

          destroyed or mutilated certificate, a new one may be issued

          therefor upon such terms and indemnity to the Corporation as the

          board of directors may prescribe.


                     Section 2.  Transfer of Shares.  Transfer of shares of

          the Corporation shall be made only on the stock transfer books of

          the Corporation by the holder of record thereof or by his legal

          representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to

          transfer, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of

          attorney duly executed and filed with the secretary of the

          Corporation, and on surrender for cancellation of the certificate

          for such shares.  The person in whose name shares stand on the

          books of the Corporation shall be deemed by the Corporation to be

          the owner thereof for all purposes.


                              Article VIII.  Indemnity.


                     Each director and officer, or former director or

          officer of this Corporation, shall be indemnified against

          expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him in connection

          with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, civil or

          criminal, in which he is made a party by reason of being or

          having been such director or officer, except in relation to<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 19

          matters in which he shall be adjudged, in such action, suit or

          proceeding, to be liable for willful misconduct in the

          performance of duty to the Corporation.  A conviction or judgment

          (whether based on a plea of guilty or its equivalent or after

          trial) in a criminal or civil proceeding shall not be deemed an

          adjudication of liability for willful misconduct in the

          performance of duty to the Corporation if such director or

          officer acted in good faith in what he considered to be the best

          interest of the Corporation and with no reasonable cause to

          believe that the action was illegal.  If in the judgment of the

          board of directors a settlement of any claim so arising is deemed

          in the best interests of the Corporation, any such director or

          officer shall be reimbursed for any amounts paid in effecting

          such settlement and reasonable expenses thereby incurred.

                To the extent available, the Corporation shall maintain

          directors and officers insurance coverage on each present and

          former director and officer of the Corporation for all acts and

          ommissions which are insurable.


                               Article IX.  Dividends.


                     The board of directors may from time to time declare,

          and the Corporation may pay, dividends on its outstanding shares

          in the manner and upon the terms and conditions provided by law

          and its articles of incorporation.


                                  Article X.  Seal.


                     The board of directors shall provide a corporate seal

          which shall be circular in form and shall have inscribed thereon

          the name of the Corporation, the state and year of incorporation,<PAGE>


          <PAGE> 20

          and the words "Corporate Seal", but the board may adopt a

          different seal from time to time.


                            Article XI.  Waiver of Notice.


                     Whenever any notice is required to be given to any

          shareholder or director of the Corporation under the provisions

          of these bylaws or under the provisions of the articles of

          incorporation or under the provisions of law, a waiver thereof in

          writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice,

          whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed

          equivalent to the giving of such notice.


                              Article XII.  Amendments.


                     These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and

          new Bylaws may be adopted by the board of directors at any

          regular or special meeting of the board of directors, but any

          Bylaws or amendments to Bylaws made by the directors may be

          amended, altered or repealed by the board of directors or by a

          majority of the stockholders.
