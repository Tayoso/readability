    Item 1 - BUSINESS


                      GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS

         Molex Incorporated originated from an enterprise established in
         1938.  It was incorporated in 1972 in the state of Delaware.  As
         used herein the term "Molex" or "Company" includes Molex
         Incorporated and its United States and international subsidiaries.

         During fiscal 1994, Molex purchased the remaining shares
         outstanding of Molex Nanco Ltd. and acquired an additional 20
         percent interest in Dongguan Molex South-China Connector Co. Ltd.
         During fiscal 1993, Molex increased its holdings in Molex India
         Ltd. (formerly Jalex Connector Systems Ltd.) to 80 percent, and
         made investments in Molex-G. Ostervig A/S, MEC International Pte.
         Ltd. and Decoupage Moulage de Savoie S.A.  All of these companies
         operate in the international connector industry.

         Molex sold its remaining interest in Flexible Automation Systems
         Pte. Ltd., a Singapore subsidiary of Molex, and sold a 15 percent
         interest in Zetronic S.p.A. during fiscal 1993.

                      GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS

         Molex is a leading manufacturer of electrical, electronic and
         fiber optic interconnection systems, ribbon cable, switches and
         application tooling.  Molex offers its customers extensive global
         design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, while
         providing local service through 41 plants in 19 countries.
         Products manufactured and sold outside the United States generated
         approximately 70% of Molex's fiscal 1994 sales.  Molex offers more
         than 40,000 products to original equipment manufacturers in
         industries that include the computer, computer peripheral,
         business equipment, telecommunication, home appliance, home
         entertainment, automotive, medical equipment and residential
         construction industries.  Molex products are sold through direct
         sales, distributors and manufacturer's representatives.  The
         worldwide market for electronic connectors, cable assemblies and
         backplanes was estimated to be $20.6 billion* in sales for fiscal
         year 1994.  With a 4.7 percent market share, Molex is the second
         largest independent connector manufacturer in the world.

         Molex conducts business in one industry segment: the manufacture
         and sale of electrical components.  The Company designs,
         manufactures, and distributes electrical and electronic devices
         such as terminals, connectors, planer cables, cable assemblies,


                                      3
<PAGE>   4
         interconnection systems, fiber optic interconnection systems,
         backplanes and mechanical and electronic switches.  Crimping
         machines and terminal inserting equipment (known as "application
         tooling") are offered on a lease or purchase basis to the
         Company's customers for the purpose of applying the Company's
         components to the customers' products.  Net revenue from
         application tooling constitutes approximately 2% of the Company's
         net revenues.  Molex products are designed for use in a broad
         range of electrical and electronic applications as set forth
         below:

</TABLE>

         The Company sells its products primarily to original equipment
         manufacturers and their subcontractors and suppliers.  The
         Company's customers include various multinational companies,
         including Apple, AT&T, Canon, Compaq, Ford, General Motors,
         Hewlett Packard, IBM, JVC, Matsushita, Motorola, Philips, Sony,
         Thomson and Xerox, many of which Molex serves on a global basis.
         Net revenues contributed by different industry groups fluctuate
         due to various factors including model changes, new technology,
         introduction of new products and composition of customers.  No
         customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues in fiscal years
         1994, 1993 or 1992.  While its customers generally make purchasing
         decisions on a decentralized basis, Molex believes that, due to
         its financial strength and product development capabilities, it
         has and will continue to benefit from the trend of many of its
         customers towards the use of fewer vendors.


                                      4
<PAGE>   5
         In the United States and Canada, the Company sells its products
         primarily through direct sales engineers and industrial
         distributors.  Internationally, Molex sells primarily through its
         own sales organizations in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,
         South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, China, England, Italy, Ireland,
         France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
         South Africa, India, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.

         Outside of the United States and Canada, Molex also sells its
         products through manufacturers' representative organizations, some
         of which act as distributors, purchasing from the Company for
         resale.  The manufacturers' representative organizations are
         granted exclusive territories and are compensated on a commission
         basis.  These relationships are terminable by either party on
         short notice.  All sales orders received are subject to approval
         by the Company.

         The Company promotes its products through leading trade magazines,
         direct mailings, catalogs and other promotional literature.  Molex
         is a frequent participant in trade shows and also conducts
         educational seminars for its customers and its manufacturers'
         representative organizations.

         There was no significant change in the Company's suppliers,
         products, markets or methods of distribution during the last
         fiscal year.

         Molex generally seeks to locate manufacturing facilities to serve
         local customers and currently has 41 manufacturing facilities in
         19 countries on five continents.  Molex facilities in the Far East
         and Europe are ISO 9000 certified, and programs are underway to
         obtain certification for facilities in Molex's other regions.
         Besides pursuing ISO 9000 quality certification in the United
         States, Molex is working on the suggestions outlined in its
         Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award application feedback
         report.

         The principal raw materials and component parts Molex purchases
         for the manufacture of its products include brass, copper,
         aluminum, steel, tin, nickel, gold, silver, nylon and other
         molding materials, and nuts, bolts, screws and rivets.  Virtually
         all materials and components used in the Company's products are
         available from several sources.  Although the availability of such
         materials has generally been adequate, no assurance can be given
         that additional cost increases or material shortages or
         allocations imposed by its suppliers in the future will not have
         a materially adverse effect on the operations of the Company.

                                  COMPETITION

         The business in which the Company is engaged is highly
         competitive.  Most of the Company's competitors offer products in
         some but not all of the industries served by the Company.  Molex


                                      5
<PAGE>   6
         believes that the ability to meet customer delivery requirements
         and maintenance of product quality and reliability are competitive
         factors that are as important as product pricing.  Some of the
         Company's competitors have been established longer and have
         substantially larger manufacturing, sales, research and financial
         resources.

                               PATENTS/TRADEMARKS

         As of June 30, 1994, the Company owned 439 United States patents
         and had 124 patent applications on file with the United States
         Patent Office.  The Company also has 497 corresponding patents
         issued and 1,841 applied for in other countries as of June 30,
         1994.  No assurance can be given that any patents will be issued
         on pending or future applications.  As the Company develops
         products for new markets and uses, it normally seeks available
         patent protection.  The Company believes that its patents are of
         importance but does not consider itself materially dependent upon
         any single patent or group of related patents.

                                    BACKLOG

         The backlog of unfilled orders at June 30, 1994 was approximately
         $175.8 million; this compares to $156.5 million at June 30, 1993.
         Substantially all of these orders are scheduled for delivery
         within twelve months.  The Company's experience is that orders are
         normally delivered within ninety days from acceptance.

                            RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

         Molex incurred total research and development costs of $64.8
         million in 1994, $56.2 million in 1993, and $47.6 million in 1992.
         The Company incurred costs relating to obtaining patents of
         $3.3 million in 1994, $2.8 million in 1993, and $2.2 million in
         1992 which are included in total research and development costs.
         The Company's policy is to charge these costs to operations as
         incurred.

         The Company had approximately 606 full-time employees in 1994 (558
         in 1993 and 532 in 1992), engaged in research, development and
         engineering functions.

         The Company introduced many new products during the year; however,
         in the aggregate, these products did not require a material
         investment of assets.

                                   COMPLIANCE

         The Company believes it is in full compliance with federal, state
         and local regulations pertaining to environmental protection.  The
         Company does not anticipate that the costs of compliance with such
         regulations will have a material effect on its capital
         expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

                                   EMPLOYEES

         As of June 30, 1994, the Company employed over 8,100 persons
         worldwide.  The Company believes its relations with its
         employees are favorable.

                            INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

         The Company is engaged in material operations in foreign
         countries.  Net revenue derived from international operations
         for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 was approximately 70% of
         consolidated net revenue.

         The Company believes the international net revenue and earnings
         will continue to be significant.  The analysis of the Company's
         operations by geographical area appears in footnote 10 on page 44
         of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated
         herein by reference.

                        Report of Independent Auditors



The Board of Directors
Molex Incorporated

We have audited the statements of income and cash flows of the Domestic
Component of Molex Incorporated (the Company), as defined in Note 1, for the
year ended June 30, 1992 (not presented separately herein). We have also
audited Schedules II, V, VI, VIII and X of the Company for the year ended June
30, 1992 (not presented separately herein). These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the results of the Company's operations and its cash
flows for the year ended June 30, 1992 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

The Company is a part of Molex Incorporated and has no separate legal status or
existence; the nature and extent of the Company's activities are determined and
directed by Molex Incorporated. The method of determining the portions of the
assets, liabilities, income and expenses of Molex Incorporated included in the
financial statements of the Company is described in Note 1.

         To the Board of Directors and
         Shareholders of Molex Incorporated
         Lisle, Illinois

         We have audited the consolidated financial statements of
         Molex Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994
         and 1993, and for each of the three years in the period ended
         June 30, 1994, and have issued our report thereon dated
         August 9, 1994; such financial statements and report are
         included in your 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders and are
         incorporated herein by reference.  Our audits also included
         the statements of changes in shares outstanding and the
         financial statement schedules of Molex Incorporated and its
         subsidiaries, listed in Item 14(a)2.  These statements and
         financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
         Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
         opinion based on our audits.  In our opinion, which is based
         upon our audits and the report of other auditors in 1992
         included herein, such statements of changes in shares
         outstanding and financial statement schedules, when
         considered in relation to the basic financial statements
         taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
         the information set forth therein.

MANAGEMENT'S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY

The management of the Company is responsible for the information contained in
the consolidated financial statements and in the other parts of this report.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Molex Incorporated and
its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. In preparing these statements, management has made
judgments based upon available information.  To ensure that this information
will be as complete, accurate and factual as possible, management has com-
municated to all appropriate employees requirements for accurate record keeping
and accounting.  

     The Company maintains an internal accounting control structure
designed to provide reasonable assurance for the safeguarding of assets against
loss from unauthorized use or disposition and reliability of financial records.
Management believes that through the careful selection of employees, the
division of responsibilities and the application of formal policies and
procedures, the Company has an effective and responsive internal accounting
control structure that is intended, consistent with reasonable cost, to provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized.  

        The Company's independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, are
responsible for conducting an audit of the Company's consolidated financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for
expressing their opinion as to whether these consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of Molex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
MOLEX INCORPORATED, LISLE, ILLINOIS

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Molex
Incorporated (a Delaware Corporation) and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994
and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of
certain components of Molex Incorporated, which statements reflect total net
revenue constituting 31% of consolidated total net revenue for the year ended
June 30, 1992.  Such financial statements were audited by other auditors whose
reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to
the amounts included for those components, is based solely on the reports of
such other auditors.  

        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of other
auditors in 1992 provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors
in 1992, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Molex Incorporated and its subsidiaries as
of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

        As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for certain postretirement
benefits to conform with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions," in 1993.

Financial Highlights

Molex achieved another year of record revenues, net income and backlog in
fiscal 1994, despite facing difficult economic conditions in several of our
largest geographic regions. One of Molex's financial goals is to increase net
revenues at approximately twice the growth rate of the connector industry.
Molex net revenues increased 12.2 percent to $964.1 million during fiscal 1994.
This growth compares favorably to the 2.0 percent increase reported for the
worldwide connector industry. We believe Molex was able to surpass this goal
because both our product line and geographic breakdown place the Company in the
faster growing product segments and geographic regions of the connector
industry.

       Income before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
increased 27.0 percent to a record $94.9 million, or 9.8 percent of net 
revenues.  This substantial improvement over last year's 8.7 percent has the 
Company well-positioned to return to our traditional goal of 10 percent. We have
started to see the effects of our efforts to streamline the operations and
reduce costs. Profitability has improved in the acquisitions we made in Germany
and France three years ago, but these positive impacts were partially offset by
the continued recessions in Japan and parts of Europe and by price erosion in
some key product lines.

Molex is also committed to providing its shareholders with a good return on
their investment. Our total return to shareholders over the last five years has
averaged an annual compounded return of 24.7 percent, compared to the 12.0
percent return of the S&P MidCap 400 over the same period of time. A $100
investment in Molex Common Stock at June 30, 1989, together with the
reinvestment of dividends, would be worth $301 at June 30, 1994.

</TABLE>

       In fiscal 1968, Molex entered the international connector market with
annual net revenues of $54 thousand. Today, 26 years later, international
customer sales have grown to $675.4 million and represent approximately 70
percent of Molex's worldwide net revenues.  International net revenues as a
percent of total net revenues decreased one percent from fiscal 1993 due to the
impact of the recession in Japan and strong growth in the U.S. Region.

       International operations are subject to currency exchange rate
fluctuations and government actions. Molex monitors its foreign currency
exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing
economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the
prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system and
the establishment of contra-currency accounts in several international
subsidiaries. Due to the uncertainty of the foreign exchange markets, Molex
cannot reasonably predict future trends related to foreign currency
fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations have impacted results in the past
and may impact results in the future.

Financial Position & Liquidity

One of Molex's many financial strengths is its exceptionally strong balance 
sheet. This strength is a direct result of the Company's ability to generate 
sufficient cash from operations for capital expenditures, debt payments and 
dividends. Cash and short-term investments increased $42.9 million during 
fiscal 1994. Cash and short-term investments at June 30, 1994 exceeded total 
current liabilities by $23.5 million and represent 20 percent of total 
consolidated assets. Cash provided from operations was $191.1 million during
fiscal 1994, increasing $54.8 million or 40.2 percent from the $136.3 million
provided from operations during fiscal 1993. Cash used for investments
increased $45.9 million over the fiscal 1993 level due primarily to the higher
level of spending for fixed assets during fiscal 1994.
<PAGE>   5
       During fiscal 1994, Molex continued its commitment to investing in new
tooling, equipment and facilities. Capital expenditures equaled $129.5 million
for fiscal 1994, increasing 38.9 percent from the $93.2 million expended during
the previous fiscal year. Approximately 80 percent of the fixed asset purchases
during fiscal 1994 were for tooling and equipment directly related to improving
efficiencies and increasing revenues. Molex also spent $10 million to build new
facilities in Bangalore, India and Lincoln, Nebraska, increasing the worldwide
facility floor space to 3.1 million square feet.

       For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, we expect capital expenditures
to increase to between $165 and $175 million. This increase in capital
expenditures is a result of stronger sales and the required investment in
plants, equipment and technology to meet our customers' needs. One example is
the investment in tooling and equipment we are making to support the U.S.
automotive business from which we expect to generate increased revenues
beginning in our fiscal year ending June 30, 1996.

       During fiscal 1994, $3.1 million was expended to purchase the remaining
shares outstanding of Molex Nanco Ltd. and to purchase an additional 20 percent
interest in Dongguan Molex South-China Connector Co. Ltd. These expenditures
were slightly higher than fiscal 1993 when $2.4 million was expended to
purchase a controlling interest in Molex India Ltd. and to purchase minority
interests in three international connector companies.

       The net trade accounts receivable balance increased $32.6 million during
fiscal year 1994 from $184.2 million at June 30, 1993 to $216.9 million at June
30, 1994. The translation effects of foreign currency accounted for $7.1
million of this increase. The non-currency related increase in net trade
accounts receivable is consistent with the increase in annual net revenues and
follows the unusually high sales volume the Company experienced during the
month of June 1994. Factoring out the impact of currency translation, the
average trade accounts receivable days outstanding of 79 days has increased one
day from the prior fiscal year.

       Inventory increased during fiscal year 1994 from $104.5 million at June
30, 1993 to $113.3 million at June 30, 1994. Factoring out the change in
exchange rates due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar, inventory at June 30,
1994 increased $4.6 million over the prior year's balance. Average inventory
days have not changed from the 79 days reported last fiscal year.

       Molex's long-term corporate philosophy is to utilize internal sources of
capital to fund investments in plant, equipment and acquisitions, using
external borrowing only when a clear financial advantage exists.  Long-term
debt continued to decrease during the fiscal year to $7.4 million at June 30,
1994.

       Management is confident that the Company's liquidity and financial
flexibility are adequate to support its current and future growth.  The Company
also has available lines of credit totaling $34.2 million of which $32.1
million remained unused at June 30, 1994.

       Molex is committed to increasing the returns earned by shareholders of
the Company. On November 11, 1993, Molex declared a 33 percent increase in its
annual cash dividend to $.04 per share from the former $.03 per share. The
Company has also issued four stock dividends to its shareholders in the last 11
years. The last Molex stock dividend was declared in October 1992. The weighted
average shares outstanding for the current fiscal year increased to 63.3
million from the 63.0 million for fiscal year 1993. The increase in shares
outstanding is attributable to the exercise of employee stock options and the
issuance of employee stock awards. The Company did not repurchase any treasury
stock on the open market during fiscal years 1994 and 1993.

       Molex ended the fiscal year with a new record backlog level of $175.8
million, a 12.3 percent increase over the prior year's amount of $156.5
million.

       The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
countries where it operates. Molex has designed an environmental program to
reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during its
manufacturing process and believes it continues to make good progress in
exceeding local governmental regulations. The Company is a defendant to several
pending legal proceedings incidental to the normal conduct of business.
Management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not
have a materially adverse impact on the financial condition or consolidated
results of operations of the Company.

Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993

During fiscal year 1994, Molex net revenues increased 12.2 percent to an
all-time high of $964.1 million, compared to $859.3 million during fiscal year
1993. Excluding the change in exchange rates due to the generally weaker U.S.
dollar, net revenue increased 10.9 percent.

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

        The Far East North Region's customer net revenues increased 7.2 percent
in U.S. dollars, but declined slightly in local currencies as the value of the
U.S. dollar continued to decline against the Japanese yen. In Japan, the
electronics industry suffered through its second consecutive year of decline.
The softness in the electronics industry combined with ongoing price erosion
affected our Japanese domestic sales, but demand for Molex Japan products
remained strong outside the region as Japanese companies continued to relocate
some of their production outside of Japan and other non-Japanese companies
designed-in Molex Japan's micro-miniature products. During the fiscal year, the
region also focused on productivity improvements and efficiencies that allowed
the region to report a slight improvement in net return on sales from the prior
fiscal year.

        The customer net revenues in the U.S. Region increased 14.6 percent
during fiscal year 1994 to $288.7 million. The sales growth is the result of
increased customer penetration in the computer and telecommunications market,
along with higher sales of newly-introduced products such as LFH and EBBI. We
also continued to see increased customer demand for our fiber optic products.
The region was able to overcome some of the effects of price erosion in the
computer market through improved manufacturing efficiencies. 

        Far East South customer net revenues increased 13.2 percent over the
prior fiscal year. However, during the third quarter of fiscal 1993, Molex sold
a manufacturing facility in Singapore and transferred part of the region's
harness operations to a newly formed joint venture company. Adjusting for this
change, Far East South net revenues increased 18 percent from last fiscal year.
This strong growth was primarily due to increased customer penetration at many
of the multinational companies who have relocated manufacturing operations to
the region and to the continued strong growth in the personal computer and disk
drive industries. Currency fluctuations did not significantly impact the
regional results during fiscal year 1994. Profitability in the region has
improved from last fiscal year's 12.2 percent return on net sales to the
current fiscal year's 13.4 percent. This increase is due to the previously
mentioned disposition of low margin operations in Singapore, improved factory
utilization and to operational improvements in our Taiwanese R.F. Division that
was acquired three years ago. Since purchasing the company, Molex has
substantially upgraded the production equipment and improved operating
efficiencies.  

        In Europe, customer net revenues improved 20.7 percent in local
currencies, but increased 10.2 percent in U.S. dollars as the dollar continued
to gain strength against most of the major European currencies. Increased
customer demand in the U.K., Ireland and France offset the continued weakness
in the German connector market. Molex continued its efforts to improve the
regional profitability through several restructuring actions during the fiscal
year. First, we consolidated our French connector manufacturing operation into
an enlarged facility in Biberach, Germany. Second, we are in the process of
progressively improving the routing of our product flow from our manufacturing
facilities to our customers. The above efforts contributed to increasing the
regional profitability from 3.3 percent of sales during fiscal year 1993 to 6.7
percent of sales during fiscal year 1994.  

        Customer net revenue in the Americas (Non-U.S.) region grew 38.4
percent from the prior year due to substantial revenue growth in Mexico and
stronger sales in Brazil.  

        The consolidated gross profit improved during fiscal 1994 to 42.1
percent of net revenues compared to 41.0 percent during fiscal 1993. The
Company was able to offset the effects of price erosion and increased
depreciation charges with improved factory utilization, favorable changes in
product mix and improved production efficiencies. Material prices and labor
costs have remained relatively stable during fiscal 1994.  

        Over the last five years, Molex has invested over $530 million in new
facilities, equipment and tooling. This significant investment has resulted in
depreciation and amortization expenses increasing 16.5 percent to $88.8 million
from $76.2 million during fiscal 1993. As a percent of sales, depreciation and
amortization charges currently represent 9.2 percent of sales compared to 8.9
percent of sales during fiscal year 1993.  

        Operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased slightly from
25.6 percent in fiscal 1993 to 25.8 percent in fiscal 1994.  This increase is
due, in part, to higher research and development expenditures.

        Research and development expenditures reached an all-time high and
represented 6.7 percent of sales during fiscal 1994 increasing from 6.5 percent
of sales during fiscal 1993. Approximately 23 percent of fiscal 1994 net
revenues resulted from the sale of products that Molex has released within the
past three years. These expenditures, coupled with the efforts of our
engineering department, resulted in the release of 158 new product families and
granting of 181 new patents during fiscal year 1994. The continued increase in
research and development reflects Molex's long-term commitment to the
reinvestment of its profits in new product design and tooling. We believe this
commitment has significantly improved our competitive position. 

        The foreign currency transaction losses decreased 29.8 percent from
fiscal 1993 losses when the Company incurred high losses due to the abrupt
devaluation of several European currencies. The majority of the exchange losses
during fiscal 1994 were due to exchange losses in Brazil as a result of the
severe devaluation of the cruzeiro against the U.S. dollar.  

        Interest income, net of interest expense for fiscal 1994 has increased
2.0 percent from fiscal 1993. Higher short-term investment balances during
fiscal 1994 were able to offset lower interest rates earned in many of the
countries where the Company has significant short-term investments.  Interest
expense has remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 1993.  

        The effective tax rate decreased to 39.6 percent during fiscal 1994
from 43.7 percent during fiscal 1993. The decrease reflects increased pretax
profitability in countries with lower effective tax rates coupled with the
ability of the Company to utilize additional foreign tax credits.

        Earnings before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
increased 27.0 percent to $94.9 million. Earnings per share increased to $1.50
during fiscal 1994 from $1.19 during fiscal 1993. Excluding the effects of
currency fluctuations, earnings before the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle increased 24.0 percent over fiscal 1993 earnings.  

Fiscal 1993 Compared to Fiscal 1992 

Net revenue for fiscal 1993 increased 10.7 percent to $859.3 million, compared
to $776.2 million for fiscal year 1992. Excluding the change in exchange rates
due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar, net revenue increased 8.1 percent. The
growth in net revenue was primarily due to the record sales by the United
States and Far East South Regions and strong revenue growth in the
Americas (Non-U.S.) Region during fiscal 1993. Revenues grew in these regions
by 18.7%, 17.6% and 17.9%, respectively, over fiscal 1992.  

        Net revenue in the Far East North Region increased 5.0 percent over
fiscal 1992. The region experienced no growth in local currencies as the growth
was due to the decline of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. The 2.3
percent growth reported in the European Region was impacted by the regional
recession as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar against most European
currencies. Excluding the effects of currency fluctuations, European net
revenues increased 5.2 percent over fiscal 1992.  

        During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, Molex adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, ''Employees' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions'' (SFAS 106). SFAS 106 requires
that the cost of retiree benefits be accrued over the period in which the
employees become eligible for such benefits. Previously, these benefits were
expensed as incurred. In adopting this standard, Molex elected to immediately
recognize the cumulative effect and restate the previously reported fiscal 1993
quarterly results; the charge to fiscal 1993 first quarter net income was $3.6
million ($5.8 million before taxes) or six cents per share. Incremental annual
service and interest charges were $.7 million ($1.1 million before taxes) or
one cent per share.  

        Earnings before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
increased 10.7 percent to $74.7 million. Earnings per share increased to $1.19
from $1.08 for fiscal 1992. Excluding the effects of currency fluctuations,
earnings before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
increased by 6.6 percent over the prior fiscal year's amount.  

        The gross profit percentage of 41.0 percent remained unchanged from
fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993. The Company was able to offset the effects of price
erosion and increased depreciation charges with increased sales volume,
favorable changes in product mix and improved operating efficiencies.

        Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 26.6
percent in fiscal 1992 to 25.6 percent in fiscal 1993. The improvement was the
result of the continued emphasis on streamlining the business and improving
efficiency.  

        Research and development expenditures represented 6.5 percent of sales
during fiscal 1993, increasing from 6.1 percent of sales during fiscal 1992.
The increase in research and development expenditures reflects Molex's
long-term commitment to the reinvestment of profits in new product design and
tooling.  

        The foreign currency transaction losses for fiscal 1993 increased $4.0
million over fiscal 1992 losses primarily due to the strength of the U.S.
dollar and Japanese yen and the volatility of exchange rates in Europe during
fiscal 1993.  

        Interest income, net of interest expense, for fiscal 1993 decreased
11.1 percent from the prior fiscal year. The decrease reflects lower interest
rates in countries where the Company has significant short-term investments.  

        The effective tax rate for fiscal 1993 increased to 43.7 percent from
42.4 percent for the prior fiscal year. The increase reflects faster revenue
growth and increased profitability in countries with higher effective tax rates
coupled with the inability of the Company to utilize all of its foreign tax
credits generated during fiscal 1993.    

Outlook 

The prospects for fiscal 1995 look promising. We believe that the connector
industry is emerging from one of the most difficult economic climates since the
Second World War. Molex has the people, products and resources to take
significant advantage of this improving climate. We continue to make the
necessary investments for continued success and have a world class organization
that is totally committed to serving our customers and making Molex a premier
global company. Molex will continue to push into new markets and expand our
product line through the introduction of new and innovative products. We expect
this effort to produce worldwide sales in excess of $1 billion during fiscal
1995. 

        During the past fiscal year, Molex has demonstrated its ability to
control costs and improve productivity. We will continue to review and
challenge all activities in the Company with the goal of improving customer
service and operating efficiencies. We believe these efforts will allow Molex
to achieve its corporate financial goal of generating 10 percent net return on
sales for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995.

                                              ========        ========

(E) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND RELATED RESERVES 
Depreciation and amortization are provided substantially on a straight-line 
basis for financial statement purposes and on accelerated methods for tax 
purposes. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 

        Buildings                       25-45 years 
        Machinery and equipment          3-10 years 
        Molds and dies                    3-4 years 

        Cost of leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the
related leases using various methods.  

(F) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PATENT COSTS 
Costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and 
applications are charged to operations as incurred. Total research and 
development costs equaled $64,772 in 1994; $56,204 in 1993 and $47,596 in 1992.

        Included in these totals are patent costs of $3,252, $2,784 and $2,174

Standards (SFAS) No. 106, ''Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits 
Other Than Pensions.'' SFAS No. 106 requires the Company to accrue retiree 
insurance benefits over the period in which employees become eligible for such 
benefits. The Company implemented SFAS 106 by recognizing the transition 
obligation immediately.

statements in order to conform to the 1994 classifications.

The shares of Common Stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are
identical except as to voting rights. Class A Common Stock has no voting rights
except in limited circumstances. So long as more than 50% of the authorized
number of shares of Class B Common Stock continue to be outstanding, all
matters, other than the election of directors, submitted to a vote of the
shareholders must be approved by a majority of the Class B Common Stock, voting
as a class, and by a majority of the Common Stock voting as a class. During
such period, holders of a majority of the Class B Common Stock could veto
corporate action that requires shareholder approval other than the election of
directors.  

        During Fiscal 1990, the shareholders approved an amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation affecting the capital structure of the Company.
The amendment provided for the creation of 60.0 million shares of a new class
of non-voting Class A Common Stock, 25.0 million shares of a new class of
Preferred Stock, and the elimination of the previously authorized class of
Preferred Stock. The issuance, terms and conditions of the new Preferred Stock
are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no shares of the
new class of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding during the three years ended
June 30, 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

        The Class B Common Stock can be converted into Common Stock on a share
for share basis at any time at the option of the holder. The authorized Class A
Common Stock would automatically convert into Common Stock on a share for share
basis at the discretion of the Board of Directors upon the occurrence of
certain events. Upon such conversion, the voting interests of the holders of
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock would be diluted.  

        The holders of the Common Stock, Class A Common Stock, and Class B
Common Stock participate equally, share for share, in any dividends which may
be paid thereon, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors, or in any
assets available upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

        The long-term portion as of June 30, 1994 is due subsequent to fiscal
year 2000.  

        The provisions of certain loan agreements contain restrictive
covenants, the more significant of which require the Company to maintain
specified liquidity and debt-to-equity ratios.

(4) DEFERRED UNEARNED COMPENSATION 
Under the 1979 Stock Option Plan and 1990 Stock Option Plan all shares issued 
are nonqualified. The option price per share is less than the fair market value
at the date of grant, thus creating deferred unearned compensation. The 
difference between the fair market value and the option price was recorded as 
deferred unearned compensation and is charged to operations over a five year 
period.  In fiscal 1994, $2,822 was charged to operations ($1,696 in 1993 and 
$2,250 in 1992).

(5) INCOME TAXES 
Effective July 1, 1991 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 109, ''Accounting for Income Taxes'' (SFAS 109). Under SFAS 109, 
the deferred tax provision is determined under the liability method. Under 
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on 
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. Adoption of the statement did 
not have a material effect on the results of operations. 

        Income tax provisions are as follows:

(6) POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS 
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Parent Company and certain of
its subsidiaries provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to its
employees. The majority of the Parent Company employees may become eligible for
these benefits if they reach age 55, with age plus years of service equal to
70. During fiscal 1994, the Company made several modifications to the
cost-sharing and benefit provisions of its postretirement plans. There are no
significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the United
States.  

        During fiscal 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, ''Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions.'' SFAS No. 106 requires that the cost of retiree
insurance benefits be accrued over the period in which the employees become
eligible for such benefits. The Company elected to immediately recognize the
effect of the change in accounting for postretirement benefits of $3.6 million
($5.8 million before tax), or six cents per share which represents the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) existing at July 1, 1992.
The Company continues to fund benefit costs primarily as claims are paid.  

        Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for fiscal years 1994 and 1993
included the following components:

        The discount rate used in determining the APBO was 7.5% and 8.5% as of
June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The assumed health care cost trend rate
used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 11.1%
in 1994, declining per year to an ultimate rate of 5.0% by 2017. The health
care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the
obligation and periodic cost reported. An increase in the assumed health care
cost trend rate by 1% in each year would increase the APBO as of June 30, 1994
by $1,035 and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by $191.  

        In fiscal 1992 the costs relating to the health care and life insurance
benefits for retirees of $95 was recognized as expense primarily as claims were
paid.

significant terms of this plan provide that (1) options may be granted for 3.1
million shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, (2) the options are
not exercisable for one year after the date of grant and thereafter up to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the options may be exercised cumulatively  during
each of the four succeeding years, and (3) the option price shall be fifty
percent (50%) of the fair market value of the stock of the Company on the date
of grant. The options expire five years from the date of the grant. The plan
expired as of June 30, 1989, and therefore, no future grants will be made under
the plan.

</TABLE>


        Intercompany net revenues are generally at cost plus the normal mark-up
charged to unaffiliated customers. Identifiable assets are those assets of the
Company that are identified with operations in each country. During 1994, 1993
and 1992, the largest single customer accounted for less than 10% of
consolidated net revenues.

(11) ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS 
The Company periodically engages in the acquisition and/or divestiture
of companies within the connector industry. These transactions have not been
material to the financial position or results of operations of the Company,
either individually or in the aggregate, and are therefore not separately
identified herein.  

        During fiscal 1994, Molex purchased the remaining shares outstanding of
Molex Nanco Ltd. and acquired an additional 20 percent interest in Dongguan
Molex South-China Connector Co. Ltd. During fiscal 1993, the Company increased
its ownership percentage in Molex India Ltd. to 80 percent, and made minority
investments in three international connector companies. Molex also sold its
remaining shares in a majority owned company and sold a portion of one of its
minority owned investments in fiscal 1993.

        The majority owned investments have been accounted for as purchases.
Operating results have been included in the financial statements from the date
of acquisition and did not have a significant effect on consolidated operating
results. The minority investments have been accounted for on the equity basis of
accounting.
