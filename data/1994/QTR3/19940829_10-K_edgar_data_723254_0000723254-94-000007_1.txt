                                ========  ========   =======
     The Company was organized as an Ohio corporation in 1929 and
     changed its state of incorporation to Washington in 1986.  At May
     31, 1994, the Company employed 8,581 employees of which 111 are
     represented by labor unions.  The Company considers its
     relationship with its employees to be satisfactory.
     
     Cintas provides a highly specialized service to businesses of all
     types - from small service companies to major corporations that
     employ thousands of people.  The Company designs, manufactures and
     implements corporate identity uniform programs throughout the
     United States.
     
     The rental markets served by the Company are highly fragmented and
     competition for this business varies at each of the Company's
     locations.  There are other companies in the uniform rental
     business which have financial resources comparable to those of the
     Company, although much of the competition consists of smaller
     local and regional firms.  In certain instances, local competitors
     may also have financial resources comparable to those deployed by
     the Company in a particular market.
     
     The service provided to the rental markets served by the Company
     principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as
     well as providing on-going uniform upgrades to each customer.  The
     Company also offers ancillary products which includes the rental
     or sale of walk-off mats, fender covers, towels, mops and linen
     products.  
     
     Due to its diverse customer base and average size account, the
     loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact
     on the Company.
     
     In its sale of customized uniforms, Cintas competes on a national
     basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers, some of
     which have financial resources comparable to the Company's.
     
     The Company operates four manufacturing facilities which provide
     for a substantial amount of standard uniform needs.  Additional
     products needed are purchased from one of several outside
     suppliers.  Because of the Company's ability to manufacture much
     of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have
     a significant effect on the Company.  In regard to the
     availability of fabric for the manufacturing process, the Company
     purchases fabric from several suppliers.  The Company is not aware
     of any circumstances which would hinder its ability to obtain
     these materials.
     
     The Company is not aware of any non-compliances with environmental
     laws or any material capital expenditures for environmental
     controls that have a material effect on its financial condition.
     
     The Company believes that the primary competitive factors that
     affect its operations are quality, service, design and price, in
     that order.

                             PROPERTIES
     
     The Company currently occupies 102 facilities located in 96
     cities.  The corporate offices provide centrally located
     administrative functions including accounting, finance, marketing
     and data processing.  The Company operates processing plants that
     house administrative, sales and service personnel and the
     necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk
     items.  Branch operations provide administrative, sales and
     service functions.  Cintas operates two distribution facilities
     and has four manufacturing plants, two of which produce uniform
     trousers and two producing uniform shirts.  The Company considers
     the facilities it operates to be adequate for their intended use. 
     The Company owns or leases 2,150 vehicles.

                        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     
     In December 1992, the Company was served with an "Imminent and
     Substantial Endangerment and Remedial Action Order" (the "Order")
     by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control relating
     to the facility leased by the Company in San Leandro, California. 
     The Order requires Cintas and three other allegedly responsible
     parties to respond to alleged soil and groundwater contamination
     at and around the San Leandro facility.  Details surrounding the
     claim are not yet known, and it is not possible at this time to
     estimate the loss or range of loss associated with the claim.

     the ordinary course of business, none of which individually or in
     the aggregate, is considered to be material to its operations or
     financial condition.  Cintas maintains insurance coverage against
     certain liabilities that it may incur in its operations from time
     to time.

     TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND FRIENDS,
     
     
          This annual report celebrates our twenty-fifth consecutive
     year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits.  We have
     reached significant milestones over these 25 years and have
     highlighted some of them in this report.  During this 25-year
     period, our sales have grown at a compound rate of 25% and profits
     have grown at a compound rate of 35%.
     
          Our vision for the future is bigger and broader than our
     vision of 25 years ago.  With sales of over a half billion dollars
     and substantial management and financial resources, we are poised
     to take advantage of the great opportunities available to us.
     
          There's hardly a business or an industry that doesn't use or
     need a uniform service of some kind.  Cintas is in an excellent
     position to fill that need.  We have grown to become the largest
     public company specializing in the uniform service business.  We
     are one of the few companies with a national presence and an
     infrastructure which consists of design and manufacturing
     capabilities, along with a national distribution system and
     management structure.
     
          Cintas has only 13% of the served market and 5% of the
     potential market which is estimated to be over $10 billion, so the
     opportunity for continued growth is excellent.  We've become quite
     adept at converting non-users to our service at a rapid rate.  In
     fact, in fiscal 1994, 67% of our new customers were first-time
     users.
     
          Acquisitions will continue to play an important role in our
     future.  The industry is highly fragmented and most companies in
     the business are smaller, family-owned and operated companies,
     with limited financial and management resources.  New technology
     and government regulations are making it more and more difficult
     for these smaller companies to compete with larger, better
     financed and managed firms.  Therefore, the reasons for them to
     merge with or sell to these larger companies are more tangible
     today than they have ever been.
     
          And so, the future looks quite promising.  The opportunities
     are fantastic and Cintas is well positioned to take advantage of
     them.
     
          Our founding principle has been, and continues to be: To
     maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and
     working partners by exceeding our customers' expectations.  That's
     more than just a slogan at Cintas - it's an overriding objective
     that is the single, 
                                     -23-
     <PAGE>
      most important aspect of our corporate
     culture.  We also want everyone at Cintas to be an owner - and
     everyone who has been with the Company for more than one year
     shares in the ownership.
     
          The net worth of our top executives consists primarily of
     Cintas stock.  Unlike many public companies where management is
     motivated more by salaries and bonuses, Cintas people are owners
     and focus on maximizing the long-term value of the Company.
     
          Our philosophy of sharing ownership has enabled us to attract
     a special group of talented people who are united in a common
     cause and enjoy what they do...people like Larry Harmon and Carl
     Kettenacker, great sources of strength and energy, will help lead
     us into the future.
     
          Larry Harmon, a 12-year partner, has been promoted to Vice
     President of our Western Region after serving as the General
     Manager of our Los Angeles operation.  Carl Kettenacker, who was
     Vice President of the Western Region, is now the Vice President
     of a newly created Research and Development Group, an organization        
     expected to accelerate the implementation of technological innovations to
     enhance our quality and improve our costs.  With 23 years of
     experience, Carl is highly qualified for this key position.
     
          In addition to these senior executives, we have a core of
     younger talented people who came to us through a management
     trainee program that we instituted back in 1981.  That first class
     of young, talented college graduates consisted of several bright,
     ambitious people, most of whom continue to serve Cintas in
     exciting positions today.  They make substantial contributions to
     our Company in high level positions at early ages...people like
     Scott Farmer, our youngest corporate officer, and other executives
     including Todd Gregory, Jim Trucksess, Pete Gilreath, Steve Kling,
     Steve Mitrione and Jeff Jones.  Their grass roots knowledge and
     understanding of our business enabled them to take on important
     management assignments, as well as serve as mentors for all of the
     management trainees we've brought into our Company since then.
     
          The opportunities for continued growth are exciting, our
     management team is stronger than it's ever been, and our financial
     resources are substantial.  Therefore, we are confident that we
     can maintain outstanding growth rates in the future as we have in
     the past.
     
     
     Sincerely yours,

ENHANCING THE IMAGE OF WORKING AMERICA
     
     Fiscal 1994 sales of $523.2 million increased 15.6% from $452.7
     million last year.  Pretax income of $85.5 million increased 19.8%
     from $71.3 million last year, while net income of $52.2 million
     increased 16.3% over $44.9 million in fiscal 1993.  Earnings per
     share increased 15.5% to $1.12 versus $.97 last year.
     
     We have broken out pretax income and net income separately to
     highlight the impact of the new tax law which involved retroactive
     taxes and some minor tax credits.  In the first quarter we
     recorded a one-time tax expense of approximately $1.1 million or
     $.02 per share.  Without this expense, our net income and earnings
     per share increases would have been more in line with the increase
     in pretax income.
     
     Our uniform rental operations, which represent approximately 90%
     of our business, extended service to five new markets.  The
     Company also completed construction of uniform rental facilities
     in Kansas City, Kansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Akron, Ohio,
     with facilities currently under construction in Portland, Oregon;
     Phoenix, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; and Charlotte, North
                                  -25-
     <PAGE>
     Carolina.  These  new facilities are all scheduled to open in
     fiscal 1995.  Sites in other cities have also been purchased for
     the construction of additional plants.  The plans for these
     additional facilities are currently being finalized and they will
     be fully operational in fiscal 1996.  Our impressive growth over 
     the past 25 years has been both exciting and rewarding.  We now
     have 100 uniform rental operations in 33 states, serving 91 of the
     top 100 U.S. markets.
     
     The National Account Division continues to expand, posting a
     dramatic increase in sales in fiscal 1994.  This increase is
     attributable to existing customers converting to newly- designed
     uniform programs and to the addition of many new customers to the
     already impressive list of regional and national companies.  The
     ability to implement major programs of this type is evidence of
     Cintas' unique capabilities.  For example, during the fourth
     quarter, we efficiently implemented newly-designed uniform
     programs for three major national accounts and expanded the
     product line for two other large customers.  As a result, our
     National Account Division had a 41% increase in sales compared to
     the fourth quarter 
                                     -26-
     <PAGE>
     of fiscal 1993.  This is an example of how our
     systems are able to accommodate demand in a relatively short
     period of time.
     
     National presence and distribution capabilities are vital
     competitive advantages, and are also key reasons for the success
     of our catalog program.  This program was created to provide
     customers and prospects with a convenient, user-friendly method
     to order uniforms and any accessory that a person might need on
     the job, including rain gear, caps, gloves, long underwear, socks
     and work shoes.  When the catalog program first began, sales of
     these types of products through the rental operations were quite
     small.  However, over the three years since it began, sales have
     grown dramatically and we anticipate this program becoming a
     significant contributor to our growth over the next three to five
     years.
     
     Acquisitions continue to play an important role in the Company's
     continued growth.  Two acquisitions in fiscal 1994 helped Cintas
     strengthen its market position in Pittsburgh and Baltimore.  A
     third acquisition, the tailored uniform division of Palm Beach
     Company, moves us in the direction of becoming a full 
                                      -27-

     uniform
     supplier for some of our customers who previously bought their
     tailored uniforms and rented our line of industrial work clothes.
       The number of acquisitions made in fiscal 1994 was relatively
     small compared to recent years.  For example, in fiscal 1993, the
     Company made 17 acquisitions, which exhausted our list of
     prospects at that time.  Cintas will continue to devote
     significant resources to identifying, evaluating and discussing
     acquisition opportunities with many new prospects and we expect
     acquisitions to continue to play a key role in the future growth
     of our Company.
     
     As the economic recovery continues, employment levels are
     rebounding.  The improving economy and the fact that we have
     increased the size of our sales force during the year should
     enable us to increase our rate of internal growth in fiscal 1995.
     
     In fiscal 1994 we continued to innovate and improve our products
     by building new style and comfort into a diversified line of
     uniforms.  Our fourth manufacturing facility came on stream late
     in the year and will enable us to sustain growth by increasing our
     manufacturing capacity.  Innovation and product 
                                       -28-

     improvement continue to distinguish us from our competitors and play an
     important role in our pursuit of new customers.  Our quality
     process and our new training programs have enhanced our already
     impressive customer retention.   As a matter of fact, our customer
     retention improved substantially in a very competitive market
     during fiscal 1994.  
     
     Cintas continues to be successful in convincing companies to adopt
     a uniform program for the first time.  In fiscal 1994, 67% of our
     new customers were companies that had never had a uniform program
     before.  We began to focus on this undeveloped potential four
     years ago and the percentage of new business generated from this
     segment has increased each year since then.  We are encouraged by
     our success in this area and will continue to pursue this
     strategy.
     
     Cintas has grown to become the largest public company in this
     business and one of the few with a national presence.  However,
     we have never given up our "close to the customer" approach to
     doing business.  Cintas is large - but the Company consists of 100
     small, local operations.  Each operation concentrates on providing
     personal customer service 
                                     -29-
     <PAGE>
     in their community.  Serving customers is a daily mission carried out by  
     1,350 service sales representatives - Cintas ambassadors who have close,  
     personal relationships with their customers.  These ambassadors are       
     Cintas' most important people.  They know their customers' needs and
     expectations and fully understand that superior service is the
     only way to guarantee life-time customers.
     
     We continue to dedicate ourselves to training our front-line
     people.  Training programs are constantly being evaluated,
     updated, expanded and implemented to meet the ever-changing needs
     of our customers.  In addition, Cintas employs exciting new
     technology to improve quality and efficiency, giving our front-
     line people the necessary tools they need to deliver superior
     service.
     
     We are proud of our past and excited about the prospects for our
     future.  We continue to set new records in revenues and net income year   
     after year.  Our dedication to customer satisfaction, attention to detail 
     and commitment to improved quality is the key to our continued success
     as the country's preferred uniform provider.

                              CINTAS CORPORATION
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
            (Amounts in thousands except per share and share data)
     
     1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     
         Business description.  Cintas provides a highly specialized
     service to businesses of all types--from small service companies
     to major corporations that employ thousands of people.  The
     Company designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity
     uniform programs which it sells or rents to customers throughout
     the United States.
         Principles of consolidation.  The consolidated financial
     statements include the accounts of Cintas Corporation and its
     subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany balances
     and transactions have been eliminated.
         Earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted
     average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
     year, including the dilutive effect, if any, of assumed conversion
     of common stock equivalents.
         Cash flows.  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the
     Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity
     of three months or less, at date of purchase, to be cash
     equivalents.  
         Marketable securities, which consist primarily of industrial
     revenue bonds and securities issued by the federal government, are
     carried at cost which approximates market.
         Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-
     out) or market.  Inventories primarily represent finished goods.
         Uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost
     less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method
     generally over periods of eight to eighteen months.
         Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
     the estimated useful lives of the assets.
         Service contracts are obtained through the acquisition of
     businesses and are amortized using the straight-line method over
     periods of five to ten years.
         Other assets consist primarily of non-compete or consulting
     agreements obtained through the acquisition of businesses, which
     are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the
     estimated lives of the agreements which are generally five to ten
     years.  Other assets also include the excess of purchase price
     over the fair market value of net assets acquired which are
     amortized using the straight-line method over forty years.

     carrying value of $38,742 at May 31, 1994 and letters of credit
     in the amount of $19,757.  Maturities of long-term debt during the
     five years ending May 31, 1999 are:  $15,742, $24,536, $18,622,
     $5,977 and $5,771, respectively.  At May 31, 1994, the fair value

     5.  LEASES
     
        The Company conducts operations from several leased facilities
     and leases certain equipment.  Most leases contain renewal options
     for periods from one to ten years.  The lease agreements provide
     for increases in rentals if the options are exercised based on
     increases in certain price level factors or prearranged increases. 
     The minimum rental payments for the five years ending May 31, 1999
     are:  $3,245, $2,807, $2,286, $2,229 and $2,071, respectively.

</TABLE>   
   
   
          In fiscal 1992, the Company recorded a $2.7 million ($.06 per
     share) cumulative credit to earnings upon adoption of SFAS No. 96,
     Accounting for Income Taxes.  SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
     Taxes, which superseded SFAS No. 96, was adopted by the Company
     effective June 1, 1993, without restatement of prior period
     financial statements or recording of a cumulative adjustment.  The
     adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted primarily in the
     reclassification of certain deferred tax balances.
     
          The components of deferred income taxes included on the
     balance sheet at May 31, 1994 and 1993 are as follows:
     
                                                 1994          1993
   Deferred tax assets:
     Employee benefits                          $4,272        $3,333
     Allowance for bad debts and other           2,667         2,447
                                                 6,939         5,780
   
   Deferred tax liabilities:
     In-service inventory                       27,575        22,827
     Depreciation                               13,509        11,380
     Other                                       3,326         1,860
                                                44,410        36,067
   
   Net deferred tax liability                  $37,471       $30,287
   
          The enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
     1993 (the Act) on August 10, 1993, resulted in increases to
     corporate marginal tax rates, retroactive to January 1, 1993.  In
     the first quarter of fiscal 1994, in accordance with the
     requirements of SFAS No. 109, the Company recorded a charge to
     earnings of $1,064 and adjusted current and deferred tax
     liabilities to reflect the change in tax rates.  The Act also
     reinstated jobs tax credits retroactive to July, 1992.  This
     reinstatement amounted to $201, which partially offset the one-
     time tax rate adjustment.
     
          Income taxes paid were $29,741, $20,938 and $17,924 for the
     years ended May 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

7.  ACQUISITIONS
     
          During fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company acquired
     eight, seventeen and eight uniform rental businesses,
     respectively.  
     
          Information relating to the acquisitions of uniform rental
     businesses which were accounted for as purchases is as follows:
     
                                               1994     1993     1992
      Number of acquisitions                       8       16        7
      Fair value of assets acquired          $11,996  $47,264  $14,058
      Liabilities assumed and incurred           200    4,880     ---
      Total cash paid for acquisitions       $11,796  $42,384  $14,058
   
   
          The results of operations from the acquired businesses are
     included in the consolidated statements of income from the dates
     of acquisition.  The unaudited pro-forma results of operations for
     the years ended May 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, assuming the
     acquisitions had occurred on June 1 of each respective fiscal year
     would be approximately as follows:
     
                                               1994     1993     1992
       Revenues                             $529,322  $483,819 $457,102
       Net income                             52,614    45,517   39,867
       Earnings per share                       1.13       .98      .86
   
   
          The unaudited pro forma results of operations are not
     necessarily indicative of the actual operating results that would
     have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on June 1 of
     each respective fiscal year or of future operating results of the
     combined companies.
     
          The Company acquired one business in fiscal 1993 in exchange
     for 180,383 shares of common stock.  This acquisition was
     accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The accompanying prior
     year consolidated financial statements were not restated as the
     results of operations of this acquisition were not material.
     
          In fiscal 1992, the Company acquired Rental Uniform Service
     of Greenville, S.C., Inc. in exchange for 2,616,230 shares of
     common stock.  
     

     
     8.  CINTAS PARTNERS' PLAN
     
          The Cintas Partners' Plan (the Plan) is a non-contributory
     profit sharing plan and ESOP for the benefit of Company employees
     who have completed one year of service.  Contributions to the Plan
     are determined at the discretion of the Company.  Effective June
     1, 1993, the Company added a defined contribution feature to the
     Plan covering substantially all employees.  A maximum 20% matching
     contribution to the Plan may be made at the Company's discretion. 
     Total contributions, including the Company's matching contribution
     during fiscal 1994, were $4,300, $3,700 and $3,200 for the years
     ended May 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     9.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     
          On February 24, 1992, the Board of Directors approved a two-
     for-one common stock split, effective April 2, 1992.  All per
     share data and other stock related disclosures appearing in these
     consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect
     all stock splits.  
     
     10.  STOCK OPTIONS
     
          Under a stock option plan adopted by the Company in fiscal
     1993, the Company may grant officers and key employees incentive
     stock options and/or non-qualified stock options to purchase an
     aggregate of 2,300,000 shares of the Company's common stock. 
     Options are generally granted at the fair market value of the
     underlying common stock on the date of grant and generally become
     exercisable at the rate of 20% per year commencing five years
     after grant, so long as the holder remains an employee of the
     Company.
     
          The information presented in the table relates to incentive
     stock options granted and outstanding under either the plan

     REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE
     
     
          The Audit Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors
     is composed of three independent directors.  The Committee, which
     held two audit meetings during fiscal year 1994, oversees the
     Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of
     Directors.
     
          In fulfilling its responsibility, the Committee recommended
     to the Board of Directors the selection of the Company's
     independent auditors.  The Committee discussed with the
     independent auditors the overall scope and specific plan for their
     audits.  The Committee also discussed the Company's consolidated
     financial statements and the adequacy of the Company's system of
     internal control.
     
          The Committee meets with the Company's independent auditors,
     without management present, to discuss the results of their
     audits, their evaluation of the system of internal control and the
     overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.  The
     meetings also are designed to facilitate any private
     communications with the Committee desired by the independent
     auditors.

     REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
     
     
     The Board of Directors
     Cintas Corporation
     
          We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
     of Cintas Corporation as of May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
     consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
     flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31,
     1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
     Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
     on these financial statements based on our audits.
     
          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
     perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
     financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
     includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
     amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
     also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
     significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
     the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
     audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     
          In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
     present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
     financial position of Cintas Corporation at May 31, 1994 and 1993,
     and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows
     for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1994, in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
     
          As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
     statements, the Company has given effect to the changes in
     accounting for income taxes pursuant to Standards promulgated by
     the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

                   CINTAS CORPORATION
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     
     
     FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993
     
          Total revenues for fiscal 1994 increased 15.6% to $523.2
     million.  Net rental revenues increased 14.8%.  Revenues in
     existing rental operations increased 9.5% while acquisitions
     accounted for the remaining growth.  
          Net sales revenues increased 21.8%.  The increase was
     attributable to the implementation of new uniform programs for
     several large national accounts and the conversion of existing
     accounts to newly-designed uniform programs.
         Income before taxes increased 19.8% to $85.5 million.  Pre-tax
     margins improved during the year from 15.7% in fiscal 1993 to
     16.3% in fiscal 1994.  Margins were impacted favorably primarily
     by decreases in medical benefits costs and workers compensation
     as the company continues to focus on cost control measures in
     these areas.  Net interest expense decreased by $.6 million
     reflecting the repayment of $8.4 million in debt and an increase
     in interest income.  
          The Company's effective tax rate increased from 37.1% to
     38.9% as a result of an increase in the federal tax rate.
     Return on equity of 18.2% was comparable with the prior year.
       Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by
     $5.8 million due to strong cash flow from internal operations. 
     The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used
     to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
     Marketable securities consist primarily of industrial revenue
          bonds and federal government securities.
       Inventories increased $7.6 million in order to provide service
     to recent acquisitions and to increase the service level to
                     existing locations.
       Net property, plant and equipment increased by $11.7 million. 
     In fiscal 1994, the Company constructed three new uniform rental
     facilities to accommodate growth in rental operations. 
       The current portion of long-term debt increased $11.3 million,
     in line with the scheduled maturities of long-term  debt.
       All other changes in balance sheet accounts correlate with the
              change in the Company's revenues.
                              
             FISCAL 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1992
                              
       On December 28, 1992, the Company purchased Maryatt Industries
     for approximately $30 million.  The Company financed a portion of
     this acquisition by borrowing $20 million.  Prior to the
     acquisition, Maryatt Industries had annual sales volume of
     approximately $28 million and operations in 9 cities primarily in
       the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and California.
       Total revenues for fiscal year 1993 increased 12.7% to $452.7
     million.  Net rental revenues increased 14.6%.  Revenues in
     existing rental operations increased 7.5% while acquisitions
             accounted for the remaining growth.
       Net sales revenue decreased 1.1%.  The decrease was attributed
     to the significant impact on the prior year's sales from the
     implementation of new uniform programs for several large national
     companies and the conversion of two major national accounts to
              newly-designed uniform programs.
       Income before income taxes increased 22.5% to $71.3 million. 
     Pre-tax margins improved during the year from 14.5% in fiscal 1992
     to 15.7% in fiscal 1993.  The margin improvement resulted from the
     consolidation of certain Rental Uniform Service of Greenville,
     S.C., Inc. operations which were in their start-up phase and were
     incurring substantial losses prior to the acquisition by the
     Company.  Margins were also impacted favorably by increased
     efficiency due to continued investment in state-of-the-art
     equipment and facilities as the Company continued to improve its
     infrastructure.  
       The Company's effective tax rate of 37.1% was comparable with
     the prior year.
       Return on equity of 18.3% compares to the previous year's
     return of 18.8%.  The fiscal 1992 results reflect the impact of
     adoption of SFAS No. 96, a change in accounting for income taxes
     which resulted in a cumulative credit of $2.7 million.  Excluding
     this credit to earnings, return on equity would have been 17.6%
     in fiscal 1992.
                                      -43-
     <PAGE>
       Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by
     $32.1 million due to strong cash flow from internal operations and
     $10.0 million borrowed through a private placement of notes.  The
     cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to
     finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Marketable
     securities consist primarily of industrial revenue bonds and
     federal government securities.  Net property, plant and equipment
     increased by $7.9 million.  In fiscal 1993, the Company
     constructed four new uniform facilities to accommodate growth in
     rental operations.
       Investments and other assets increased by $36.6 million or
     73.8% reflecting service contracts and non-compete or consulting
     agreements obtained through the acquisition of other uniform
     businesses.
       All other changes in balance sheet accounts correlated with
     the change in the Company's revenues.
                              
                     FINANCIAL CONDITION
                              
       At May 31, 1994, the Company had $60.8 million in cash, cash
     equivalents and marketable securities.  The Company's investment
     policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative. 
     Preservation of principal while earning an attractive yield are
     the criteria used in making investments.  Working capital
     increased $8.0 million to $130.0 million due primarily to an
     increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
                              
       Capital expenditures for fiscal 1994 totaled $37.2 million. 
     The Company continues to reinvest profits into land, buildings and
     equipment in order to expand capacity for future growth.  The
     Company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 1995 will
                  approximate $48 million.
                              
       The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase
     of up to two million shares of the Company's common stock.  The
     stock may be purchased from time to time as market conditions
                          dictate.
                              
       The Company believes that its current cash position, funds
     anticipated to be generated from operations and the strength of
     its banking relationships is sufficient to meet its anticipated
      financing requirements in the foreseeable future.
                              
       The Company's percentage of debt to total capitalization was
     24.4% at May 31, 1994, vs. 29.0% at May 31, 1993.  
                              
       During the fiscal year, the Company paid a dividend of $.17
     per share.  This dividend is an increase of 21%over that paid in
     fiscal 1993.  
                              
                          INFLATION
                              
       Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on
     the Company's financial condition or a negative effect on
     operations.
