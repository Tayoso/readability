PART I

Item 1.  -  Business.

	Worthington Industries, Inc. was initially incorporated in 
Ohio in 1955.  It reincorporated in Delaware in 1986 through a 
statutory merger.  Worthington Industries, Inc. and its 
subsidiaries are herein referred to as the "Company."  The 
Company's operations are grouped into three segments: processed 
steel products, custom products and cast products.

	The processed steel products segment is engaged in the 
business of processing flat rolled steel to close tolerances for 
sale to industrial customers who require steel of precise 
thickness, length, width, shape, surface finish and temper for 
their own product fabrication.  The Company also makes its own 
line of finished processed steel products such as low pressure 
cylinders for containing liquefied petroleum, refrigerant and 
other gases.

	The custom products segment produces injection-molded 
plastic and precision metal parts for sale to manufacturers of 
automobiles, appliances, lawn equipment, audio equipment, 
recreational items, housewares and other items in North America.

	The cast products segment produces a broad line of cast 
steel products for sale to the freight railcar, mass transit and 
industrial markets.

	For information regarding the net sales and revenues, 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, and 
identifiable assets attributable to each segment for each of the 
last three fiscal years, reference is made to page 25 of the 
Company's annual report to shareholders for the year ended 
May 31, 1994 which is incorporated herein by reference.

	During the year ended May 31, 1994, the Company acquired 
additional equity in Rouge Steel Company, exercising a favorable 
option acquired when the original investment was made in fiscal 
1990.  This brought the Company's equity ownership in Rouge to 
approximately 28% and the Company was required by generally 
accepted accounting principles to change its method of carrying 
the investment from cost to equity.  See Note J of the Notes to 
the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which are 
included in Item 8 hereof, for additional information concerning 
the Company's investment in Rouge Steel Company and other 
unconsolidated affiliates.

Processed Steel Products.

	The Company buys coils of wide, open tolerance sheet steel 
from major steel mills, and processes it to the custom order of 
more than 1,700 industrial customers in the automotive, 
automotive supply, appliance, electrical, communications, 
construction, office furniture, office equipment, agricultural, 
machinery, leisure time and other industries.  The Company does 
not process steel for inventory.

	Techniques such as slitting, roller leveling, cold reduc-
tion, edge rolling, blanking, coating, annealing and pickling are 
used to process steel to specified thickness, length, width, 
shape, temper and surface quality.  One or more processes are 
applied to produce steel of specified character and dimension 
which the customer can stamp, blank, draw, roll form, fabricate 
or otherwise incorporate into component parts or end products.  
Slitting is cutting steel to specified widths.  Roller leveling 
is flattening steel and cutting it to exact lengths.  Cold 
reduction is rolling steel to close tolerances of thickness and 
temper.  Edge rolling imparts round, smooth or knurled edges.  
Blanking cuts the steel into specific shapes.  Coating results in 
the production of painted, galvanized or nickel-plated steel.  
Annealing is a thermal process which changes the hardness of 
steel.  Pickling is a chemical process whereby an acidic solution 
removes the surface oxide, commonly called "scale", which 
develops on steel when it is hot rolled.

	Steel processing is highly competitive.  The Company 
competes with many other intermediate processors.  The Company 
knows of no other intermediate processor which offers the same 
type and extent of technical service support provided by the 
Company relating to material testing and application of material 
suited to the particular needs of customers (see "Technical 
Services").  The Company is unable to gauge, however, the extent 
to which its technical service capability has improved its 
competitive position.

	The Company manufactures steel cylinders having refrigerant 
gas capacities of 15 to 1000 pounds, and steel and aluminum 
cylinders with liquefied petroleum gas capacities of 4-1/4 to 420 
pounds.  These cylinders are designed and produced in accordance 
with safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation which specify materials, design limitations, and 
marking, inspection and testing procedures to be used.  The 
cylinders are produced by precision stamping, deep drawing and 
welding of component parts to customer specifications.  They are 
then tested, painted and packaged as required.

	Disposable steel cylinders manufactured by the Company are 
sold predominantly to major refrigerant gas producers who fill 
the cylinders with refrigerant gases and re-sell them to dealers 
for use in charging residential, commercial, automotive and other 
air conditioning and refrigeration systems.  Reusable steel and 
aluminum cylinders are built to contain liquefied petroleum gas 
for use as a fuel, and the major buyers are manufacturers of 
barbecue grills.  Reusable cylinders are also sold to propane and 
gas grill distributors, mass merchandisers and manufacturers and 
users of materials-handling, heating, cooking and camping 
equipment.  The Company also manufactures other cylinder products 
such as recapture and recycling tanks for refrigerant gases, 
helium tanks and compressed air tanks.  It also sells acetylene 
cylinders for welding applications.  While a large percentage of 
sales are made to major accounts, the Company has over 1,000 
cylinder customers.

	The Company has two principal competitors in its major 
pressure cylinder markets, of which management believes the 
Company has the largest share.  However, the Company has no 
reliable information with respect to the size of any of its 
various product markets or its relative position therein for any 
segment.

	The largest customer of the processed steel products segment 
is General Motors Corporation, purchasing through decentralized 
divisions and subsidiaries and in different geographical areas.  
(See "Marketing and Competition").  The loss of General Motors as 
a customer could have an adverse effect on the segment, but the 
Company has no reason to believe that the loss of this customer 
is likely.

	The Company purchases steel in large quantities, at regular 
intervals from major primary producers for its steel processing 
and pressure cylinder operations.  During the fiscal year ended 
May 31, 1994 the Company's major suppliers were Rouge Steel 
Company (in which the Company holds a minority equity position) 
Bethlehem Steel Corporation, LTV Steel Corporation, USX 
Corporation, WCI Steel, Inc., Weirton Steel Corporation and 
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation. During the fiscal year 
ended May 31, 1994, the Company's major suppliers of aluminum for 
pressure cylinders were Alumax Aluminum Sales Corporation 
Cressona Aluminum Company and Aluminum Corporation of America. 
Management believes that its supplier relationships are good.

Custom Products.

	In the custom products segment, the Company manufactures 
injection molded plastic and precision metal parts to customer 
specifications. The primary customers of this segment are in the 
automotive original equipment markets, but sales are also made to 
manufacturers of appliances, lawn equipment, audio equipment, 
recreational items, hand tools, housewares and other items. 
Principal products of the segment are a variety of custom made 
injection molded plastic components (both functional and decorative) 
which, depending on the customers' needs, can also be painted, assembled, 
silk screened, vacuum metalized, hot stamped, roll foiled, vinyl 
wrapped, foamed in-place and/or appliqued by the Company. 
Precision metal components are made primarily for power steering, 
transmission, brake and other mechanical systems.

	The custom products segment relies heavily on sales to 
General Motors Corporation, The Ford Motor Company and Chrysler 
Corporation.  The loss of any of these customers could have an 
adverse effect on the segment but the Company has no reason to 
believe that the loss of any of these customers is likely.

	Plastic resins and bar steel, the major raw materials 
required by this segment, are available from many sources.

	The Company has numerous competitors in the sale of its 
custom products.  This business competes in its markets by 
seeking to provide well-engineered, quality products within 
required delivery terms to meet the specific needs of its plastic 
parts and precision metal component customers.

Cast Products.

	The Company's cast products segment operates a steel 
castings business.  The steel castings operation manufactures a 
diverse line of cast steel products ranging in size from 100 
pounds to 30 tons.  These products are offered to the railroad, 
mass transit, construction and off-highway markets, and are 
produced to satisfy customer orders.  The Company can also pour 
ingots of special alloy steel which are converted to coils, 
plates, bars and forgings by outside users.

	In general, there are a number of companies involved in the 
sale of steel castings.  However, there are four major 
competitors in the sale of certain railcar castings.  The 
Company's cast products are generally sold under trademark which 
is a stylized "Circle B", and the Company utilizes various other 
owned and licensed trademarks and patents in connection with its 
cast products.  The Company is the leading North American 
designer and producer of undercarriages for mass transit cars and 
holds numerous patents for them.

	Scrap steel, the major raw material required by the cast 
products segment, is purchased from several sources, including a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Supplies of scrap steel 
have been adequate, although pricing in the market tends to be 
volatile.  Other raw materials used by this segment are obtained 
from a number of major suppliers.

Technical Services.

	The Company employs a staff of engineers and other technical 
personnel and maintains fully-equipped, modern laboratories to 
support its operations.  The facilities enable the Company to 
verify, analyze and document the physical, chemical, 
metallurgical and mechanical properties of its raw materials and 
products.  Technical service personnel also work in conjunction 
with the sales force to determine the types of flat rolled steel 
and steel castings required for the particular needs of the 
Company's customers.  In order to provide such service, the 
Company maintains a continuing program of developmental 
engineering with respect to the characteristics and performance 
of its products under varying conditions.  Laboratory facilities 
are also used to perform the quality control and extensive 
testing of all low pressure cylinders required by the regulations 
of the U. S. Department of Transportation and associated 
agencies, as well as varying customer requirements.  The Company 
also maintains a separate testing facility for its steel castings 
operation.

Marketing and Competition.

	The Company's products and services are sold primarily by 
Company sales personnel.

	As a percentage of the Company's consolidated sales and 
revenues, sales of steel processing services represented 59% for 
fiscal 1994, 56% for fiscal 1993 and 52% for fiscal 1992; sales 
of pressure cylinders represented 13% for 1994, 13% for 1993 and 
11% for 1992; and sales of custom plastics represented 17% in 
1994, 19% in 1993 and 20% in 1992.

	During the fiscal year ended May 31, 1994, General Motors 
Corporation, purchasing through decentralized divisions and 
subsidiaries in different geographical areas, accounted for 
approximately 12.6% of the Company's consolidated sales and 
revenues.

	The principal methods of competition encountered by the 
Company are quality of product, ability to meet delivery 
requirements of customers, and price.  Geographic proximity to 
customers has a significant effect upon relative ability to meet 
customer delivery schedules and impacts the freight charge 
portion of overall product price.  See also the information set 
forth above as to competition in the various segments.

Environmental Regulation.

	The Company's manufacturing facilities, generally in common 
with those similar industries making similar products, are 
subject to many federal, state and local requirements relating to 
the protection of the environment.  The Company continually 
examines ways to reduce emissions and waste and to effect cost 
savings related to environmental compliance.  Management does not 
anticipate that capital expenditures for environmental control 
facilities required in order to meet environmental requirements 
will be material when compared with the Company's overall capital 
expenditures.

Employees.

	The Company employs approximately 7,700 people.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

	The Company participates in four joint ventures as follows:  
(a) Worthington Armstrong Venture manufactures suspended ceiling 
systems for concealed and lay-in panel ceilings from three plants 
located in Pennsylvania, Maryland and France; (b) Worthington 
Specialty Processing processes wide sheet steel from its plant in 
Jackson, Michigan; (c) TWB Company, located in the Detroit, 
Michigan area, produces laser welded steel blanks for the 
automobile industry; and (d) London Industries, Inc. produces 
injection molded plastic products in London, Ohio.  The Company 
also owns a minority equity interest (28%) in Rouge Steel 
Company, an integrated steel mill located near Detroit, Michigan.  
See Note J of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information on these unconsolidated 
affiliates of the Company.

Item 2. - Properties.

	The Company's principal properties presently consist of 25 
owned and 2 leased manufacturing and office facilities.  These 
properties are located in Ohio (12), Alabama (1), Georgia (3), 
Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), Maryland (1), Michigan (2), Oklahoma 
(1), Ontario (1), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (2) and 
Tennessee (1).  These plants and offices are used in the 
processed steel products (16), custom products (7) and cast 
products (3) segments and for general corporate purposes (1).  
The above facilities, all of which are well maintained and in 
good operating condition, contain in excess of 5,000,000 square 
feet, and are adequate to meet the Company's present needs.

	See Item 1 under the heading "Investments in Unconsolidated 
Affiliates" for the location of the Company's unconsolidated 
affiliates.

Item 3. - Legal Proceedings.

	The Ohio EPA has threatened to sue the Company's subsidiary, 
Buckeye Steel Castings Company, for various alleged air pollution 
matters at its foundry in Columbus, Ohio.  The primary 
allegations concern (a) alleged emissions of fugitive dust from 
the facility, mainly related to malfunctions of its dust 
collection systems (i.e. baghouses) in 1989; (b) alleged failures 
to obtain permits in a timely manner; and (c) alleged failures in 
prior years to use reasonably available control measures to 
collect dust inside its facility.  The Company disputes the 
alleged violations, and is currently involved in negotiations in 
an attempt to resolve the matter.  Any remedy will be discussed 
as part of the negotiations.

Item 4. - Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

	Not applicable.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Worthington Industries, Inc. and
Subsidiaries (the "Company").  Investments in unconsolidated
affiliates are accounted for using the equity method.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated. Certain reclassifications were made to prior
years' amounts to conform with the 1994 presentation.
     Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The Company considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
     Short-Term Investments:  Short-term investments consist
principally of common stocks carried at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost was $898,000 and market value was $1,516,000
at May 31, 1993.
     Inventories:  Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost or market.  Cost is determined using the specific
identification method for steel processing and the first-in,
first-out method for all other businesses.
     Property and Depreciation:  Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.  Accelerated depreciation methods are used for
income tax purposes.
     Capitalized Interest:  Interest is capitalized in
connection with construction of qualified assets.  Under
this policy, interest of $443,000 was capitalized in 1992.
     Post Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions:  The
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Post
Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," effective June 1,
1993.  The adoption of this Statement did not have a
material impact on the Company's operating results or
financial position.  As permitted by Statement 106, the
Company elected not to restate the financial statements of
any prior years.
     Statements of Cash Flows:  With respect to non-cash
activities in fiscal 1994, the Company recorded its
increased equity from the Rouge Steel Company's initial
public offering as an increase in  investments in
unconsolidated affiliates(see Note J).  During fiscal 1993,
$6,282,000 of inventory and $3,421,000 of fixed assets were
reclassified to investments in unconsolidated affiliates as
the initial investment in Worthington Armstrong Venture.
     Supplemental cash flow information for the years ended
May 31, is as follows:
In thousands                  1994           1993           1992
Interest paid               $ 2,973        $ 3,957        $ 4,129
Income taxes paid            39,957         35,548         29,591

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The following
methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating the fair value of its financial instruments:
     Cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and long-term
debt - The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets
approximate fair value.
     Short-term investments - The fair value for marketable
equity securities are based on quoted market prices.
     The concentration of credit risks from financial
instruments, related to the markets discussed in Review of
Operations starting on page 6, are not expected to have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position, cash flow or future results of operations.
From p. 26 of Annual Report

NOTE B - Shareholders' Equity

On September 16, 1993 and on September 19, 1991, the Company's
Board of Directors authorized three-for-two splits of the common
shares, with distribution of the additional shares on October
22, 1993 and October 25, 1991, to holders of record on October 1,
1993 and October 4, 1991.  Also on September 16, 1993, the
shareholders adopted an amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company to increase the authorized number of
common shares from 100,000,000 shares to 150,000,000 shares.
References in this annual report to per share amounts and to the
number of common shares have been adjusted, were appropriate, to
give retroactive effect to the share splits. The Board of
Directors is empowered to determine the issue prices, dividend
rates, amounts payable upon liquidation, voting rights and other
terms of the preferred shares when issued.

</TABLE>

The Company had short-term notes payable to bank totaling $10,000,000, 
at May 31, 1994.  The rate for these borrowings, which was 4.8% at 
May 31, 1994, is based on the bank's cost of funds plus a fixed percent.  
The Company has committed lines of credit permitting unsecured borrowings 
totaling $40,000,000, at rates below the prime rate.  Of these lines of 
credit, $35,000,000 were unused at May 31, 1994, and do not require 
compensating balances. The industrial development revenue bonds and 
notes (IRBs) represent loans to purchase or obligations to lease 
facilities and equipment costing $24,601,000.  The leases are accounted 
for as lease purchases with ownership passing to the Company at the 
expiration dates for nominal amounts.  The IRBs mature serially through 
2011 and may be retired in whole or in part at any time. During the 
year ended May 31, 1994, the Company fixed the interest rate on 
$11,265,000 of the IRBs at 5.9%.  Of the remaining IRBs, $3,531,000 
have a fixed interest rate of 8.0%, and $113,000 carry a variable 
interest rate based upon a percentage of the prime rate.  At May 31, 
1994, this interest rate was 4.7%.During the year ended May 31, 1994, 
the Company extended the maturity date of a $13,000,000 unsecured bank 
note payable from October 1997 to October 2001. This note carries a 
variable interest rate based on the Company's choice of one, two, 
three or six month London Interbank Offered Rates plus a fixed percent.  
At May 31, 1994, this rate was 5.0%.  The Company may elect to convert 
to a fixed rate at any time during the term of the loan.  The remaining
$27,000,000 note payable is a 15 month evergreen note with a current 
maturity date of August 1995.  At May 31, 1994, the interest rate on 
this note, based on the ninety-day London Interbank Offered Rate plus
a fixed percent, was 4.9%. Various debt agreements place restrictions 
on financial conditions and require maintenance of certain ratios.  
One of these restrictions limits cash dividends and certain other 
payments to $3,000,000 plus 75% of net earnings, as defined, 
subsequent to May 31, 1976.  Retained earnings of $269,395,000 were 
unrestricted at May 31, 1994. Principal payments on long-term debt, 
including lease purchase obligations, in the next five fiscal years 
are as follows: 1995 -- $1,490,000; 1996 -- $27,660,000; 1997 -- 
$660,000; 1998 -- $4,191,000; 1999 -- $660,000; and thereafter -- 
$20,965,000. The Company is guarantor on bank loans for three 
separate joint ventures.  The guarantees totaled $37,200,000 
at May 31, 1994 and relate to debt with varying maturities.  
The Company believes the guarantees will not significantly 
affect the consolidated financial position or future results of 
operations.

</TABLE>

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective June 1, 1993.  This 
change had no material effect on the Company's financial position nor 
its results of operations.  As permitted by Statement 109, the Company has 
elected not to restate the financial statements of any prior years. 
Under Statement 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income 
taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined 
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be 
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Prior to the 
adoption of Statement 109, income tax expense was determined using the 
deferred method.  Deferred tax expense was based on items of income and 
expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements 
and tax returns and measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the 
difference originated. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects 
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax 
purposes.  Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities 
and assets as of May 31, 1994 are as follows:

NOTE E - Employee Benefit Plans
      Nonunion employees of the Company participate in a current cash profit 
sharing plan and a deferred profit sharing plan.  Contributions to and costs
of these plans are determined as a percentage of the Company's operating
income.  
      Certain operations have non-contributory defined benefit pension plans 
covering a majority of their employees qualified by age and service.  Company 
contributions to these plans comply with ERISA's minimum funding requirements.

benefit plans in 1994, 1993 and 1992, and the contributions charged to pension 
expense for the defined contribution plans follows:

NOTE J - Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates

The Company's investments in affiliated companies which are not majority owned
or controlled are accounted for using the equity method.  Investments carried
at equity and the percentage interest owned consist of Worthington Specialty 
Processing (50%), London Industries, Inc. (60%), Worthington Armstrong
Venture (50%), TWB Company (50%) and Rouge Steel Company (28%).
  
	During 1994, the Company increased its voting ownership in Rouge, an 
integrated steel mill located in Detroit, Michigan.  Accordingly, the Company 
changed its method of carrying the investment from cost to equity as required
by generally accepted accounting principles.  The financial statements of
prior years have been restated back to fiscal 1990, the year of the original
investment in Rouge.  The effect of the restatement was to increase  1993 net
income by $1,745,000 or $.02 per share and to decrease 1992 net income by
$562,000 or  $.01 per share.  Included in the 1992 restatement was equity in
Rouge's cumulative effect of adopting FASB Statements 106 and 109, which
decreased net income by $3,058,000 or $.03 per share.  Certain
reclassifications were made to prior year's amounts to conform with
the 1994 presentation. 
 
	The Company's equity interest in Rouge for the restatement periods is shown 
at 25%.  After Rouge's initial public offering (IPO), completed in April 1994, 
the Company's interest is 28%.  Rouge sold 5,601,800 shares in the IPO for 
$123,000,000.  The Company recorded its increased equity in Rouge from the IPO 
($10,046,000), which is net of deferred taxes ($5,405,000), as additional
paid-in capital.  The market value of the Company's investment in Rouge at
May 31 1994, was approximately $156 million. 

	At May 31, 1994, the Company's share of the underlying net assets of Rouge 
exceeded the investment by $10,667,000.  The excess is being amortized into 
income by increasing equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates using
the straight-line method over 14 years.

	Financial information for affiliated companies accounted for by the equity 
method is as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
 
Shareholders and Board of Directors 
Worthington Industries, Inc. 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Worthington 
Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related 
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1994.  These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these  financial statements 
based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
 An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. 
 
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
 fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of 
 Worthington Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries at May 31, 1994 and 1993, 
 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for 
 each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1994, in conformity 
 with generally accepted accounting principles.
  
As discussed in Note J to the consolidated financial statements, the 
Company's 1993 and 1992 financial statements have been restated to
retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting for an investment in an
affiliated company previously carried at cost.
