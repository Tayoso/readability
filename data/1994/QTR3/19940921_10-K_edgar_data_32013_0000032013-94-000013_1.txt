PART 1

Item 1  Business

   (a)  General Development of Business

        Registrant was initially organized as an Illinois corporation on
        November 28, 1922 under the name of "Elco Tool and Screw Corporation".
        The Registrant conducted business as an Illinois corporation under 
        that name until June 9, 1969, at which time it changed its state of
        incorporation from Illinois to Delaware and its name to "Elco 
        Industries, Inc".

        In June 1989, the Company and Nagoya Screw Manufacturing Co., Ltd. 
        ("Nagoya") formed a joint venture known as Rocknel Fastener, Inc. 
        ("Rocknel").  Each company has a 50% interest in the venture.  Elco 
        and Nagoya have equal representation on the Board of Directors of 
        Rocknel.  Rocknel manufactures and sells fasteners to Japanese-owned
        manufacturers in North America.  

        In May 1991, the Registrant purchased the busines and certain assets 
        of the Bear-Kat Products division of Key Manufacturing Group, Inc.  
        Bear-Kat Products markets a full line of fasteners and related items 
        to the consumer/do-it-yourself (DIY) market.

   (b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments

        The information called for by Item 1 (b) is hereby incorporated by 
        reference to the "Products and Major Customers" footnote of the Notes
        to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 2, pages 30-31) of the 
        Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended June 30,
        1994.

   (c)  Narrative Description of Business

        (i) Principal Products

        The Registrant is a leading U.S. designer, manufacturer and supplier 
        of specialty metal fasteners and custom-engineered metal and plastic 
        components and products.  The Registrant also offers a wide variety of 
        packaged fasteners, fastening-related products and other hardware 
        accessories to the do-it-yourself market. The Registrant's products 
        can be classified in two groups: industrial products and home and 
        construction products.

        Industrial products include engineered specialty fasteners and 
        application-specific, cold-formed, precision metal stamped and 
        plastic molded components and assemblies combining the three 
        manufacturing disciplines, which are supplied to a variety of markets 
        including the transportation, electrical and electronics, fabricated  
        metal and other industrial markets.  Industrial products are sold 
        primarily to original equipment manufacturers.

        Home and construction products include a full line of fasteners, wire
        and fastening-related products packaged and merchandised for consumer
        use.  This group is also involved in the design, manufacture and 
        marketing of specialty product lines and fastening systems for the 
        non-residential construction industry. 

        The following table sets forth sales of these product groups for the 
        years indicated:

Consolidated Sales              $225,901,000   $199,179,000   $189,337,000

</TABLE>

        Registrant sells a portion of its products through its own employee 
        sales organization which is paid on a salary plus commission basis.  
        It also sells a portion of its products through independent 
        manufacturer's representatives who are paid on a commission basis.  
        These organizations are granted territories covering the United 
        States.  Each of the Registrant's segments has a separate sales 
        force.  The Registrant's relationships with its independent
        representatives are terminable by either party on short notice.

        (ii) Status of Product or Segment

        The Registrant does not contemplate the introduction of any new 
        product or industry segment, other than in the ordinary course of 
        manufacturing custom-designed products primarily to customer 
        specifications.  The manufacturing of custom-designed products will 
        not require any substantial investment other than those capital 
        expenditures required for modernization of equipment and for 
        increased capacity for products.

        (iii) Source and Availability of Raw Materials

        The Registrant uses a variety of metals in the manufacture of its 
        products, such as low and medium carbon steel, low alloy steel, 
        stainless steel, aluminum, brass and commercial bronze.  The 
        Registrant also uses a variety of plastics for injection molding.  
        The Registrant believes that its sources of supply of these materials
        are adequate for its needs and that it is not substantially dependent
        upon any one supplier.

        The Registrant purchases most products for DIY consumers from foreign 
        suppliers for resale in the United States.  As a manufacturer, the 
        Registrant would not be competitive with foreign manufacturers of 
        standard fasteners sold primarily to consumers.  A majority of the 
        imported products are sourced through international vendors and
        importing companies. These products are imported from a variety of 
        countries, including Taiwan, Korea, India, Japan and several European
        countries.  Taiwan is currently the largest single source country.  
        There are many standard fastener sources throughout the world, and 
        thus the loss of a major vendor of imported products would not have a
        material, adverse effect on the Registrant.

        (iv) Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, and Concessions

        Registrant owns numerous patents relating to the design and 
        manufacture of its products.  Although the Registrant generally seeks
        to obtain patents where appropriate, it does not consider the success
        of its business to be dependent on any of its patents or patent 
        applications.

        The Registrant is licensed on a non-exclusive basis to manufacture 
        and sell a number of products primarily related to fasteners. These 
        licenses require the payment of royalties based on sales of the 
        licensed product. Sales of licensed products accounted for 
        approximately $32.4 million in sales for the fiscal year ended June 
        30, 1994. The Registrant considers these licenses to be of importance
        to its business, and the termination of certain of these licenses 
        would have a material, adverse effect upon the Registrant. These 
        licenses are not terminable by the licensor, except by failure of the
        Registrant to pay royalties or meet quality standards. The Registrant
        does not anticipate that any of the license agreements will be
        terminated in the near future.

        The Registrant has a number of registered trademarks, but other than 
        the trademark "Elco", none of these trademarks is considered to be 
        material to the Registrant's sales or revenues.

        (v) Seasonal Variations in Business

        Sales and revenues of a material portion of the Registrant's business
        are normally stronger in the second half of the Registrant's fiscal 
        year.  Production levels are generally lower during the Registrant's 
        first half of the fiscal year because of customer plant shutdowns due to
        summer vacations and the number of holidays scheduled during the 
        month of December by both customers and the Registrant.

        (vi) Working Capital Practices

        The Registrant has not adopted nor does it intend to adopt practices, 
        credit terms, or methods of doing business which will have a material 
        effect on changes in working capital during its fiscal year.

        The seasonal changes in sales and revenues explained in paragraph (v)
        above normally do not place an undue strain on working capital 
        requirements which would require short-term borrowings.

        (vii) Dependence Upon Limited Number of Customers

        In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, a material portion of the 
        Registrant's sales were dependent on Ford Motor Company and General 
        Motors Corp.  The Registrant's sales to Ford Motor Company and 
        General Motors Corp. accounted for 18% and 14%, respectively, of 
        total consolidated sales during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.    
        To the extent that sales to all or several divisions of Ford or
        General Motors would be terminated or materially reduced, there
        would be a material, adverse effect on the Registrant.

        (viii) Backlog

        The Registrant estimates that the total dollar amount of its backlog 
        of orders believed to be firm as of June 30, 1994, and June 30, 1993,
        was approximately $52,100,000 and $40,600,000, respectively.  The 
        Registrant expects that substantially all of the current backlog will
        be shipped in the next 12 months.  The Registrant does not consider the
        size of its backlog as of a given date to be significant relative to 
        a forecast of annual sales because most orders are for short-term 
        delivery.  Furthermore, orders may be cancelled or delivery delayed 
        by the customer without significant penalty.

        (ix) Government Contracts

        The Registrant is not dependent upon government contracts for a 
        material portion of its business.

        (x) Competitive Conditions

        Industrial Products Segment

        The metal fastener and component business is highly competitive. 
        Several competitors of the Registrant have greater financial 
        resources and operate more facilities.  However, the Registrant 
        believes its knowledge and continued refinement of the cold-forming 
        process, combined with close cooperation with customers' engineers,
        quality conformance and the capability to supply a wide range of 
        fastener products required by its customers, have established Elco as a 
        leader in the specialized fastener market.  The Registrant considers 
        the Camcar Division of Textron, the Shakeproof Division of Illinois 
        Tool Works, SPS Technologies and Federal Screw Works to be among the 
        major competitors of Elco's Industrial Products Group.  The metal 
        stamping and plastics parts businesses in which the Registrant is 
        engaged are also highly competitive.  There are numerous companies 
        supplying metal stampings and plastic parts to the automotive 
        industry.  The Registrant believes that no one supplier is in a 
        dominant position.  The Registrant also encounters competition from 
        supplier of fasteners and metal parts made by other processes, such 
        as screw machines and powdered precision forming, as well as other 
        fastening methods such as adhesives, epoxies, clips and plastic 
        parts.  Competition in this segment is based on quality, service, 
        price and engineering capability.
      
        Home and Construction Products Segment

        The Registrant considers Hillman Fasteners, Crown Bolt and the  
        Bulldog Jordan unit of Newell Co. to be the major copetitors of the 
        home products portion of the Home and Construction Products Group.  
        Competition is primarily based on service, price and merchandising 
        capability.  The Registrant believes that the major competitors of the
        construction products portion of this group include the Buildex and 
        Ramset Divisions of Illinois Tool Works.  Competition is based on 
        quality, service, price and engineering capability.

        While the Registrant faces potential competition from foreign 
        manufacturers, it does not believe it currently has significant 
        direct foreign competitors in the markets it serves.

        (xi) Research and Development

        The Registrant spent approximately $2,900,000, $2,300,000 and
        $2,200,000 on new or existing product development projects during the
        fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, none 
        of which was customer sponsored.  The Registrant believes that the
        amounts indicated above are not indicative of the total effort spent 
        on developing new products and production processes, but the 
        Registrant is not able to quantify all production related costs of 
        such activities.  Products are generally developed or improved as a
        result of providing engineering and design services for customer 
        applications.
 
        (xii) Environmental Disclosures
   
        The Registrant believes that it is in compliance with federal, state 
        and local laws and regulations.  The Registrant believes that 
        continued compliance will not have a material effect on the 
        Registrant.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the Registrant 
        spent approximately $230,000 on capital expenditures related to 
        protection of the environment, and anticipates spending a somewhat 
        higher amount in fiscal 1995 for such purposes.

        (xiii) Number of Employees

        The average number of persons employed by the Registrant during the 
        fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, was approximately 1,971.

    (d) Foreign Operations and Export Sales
   
        The Registrant is not engaged in any material operations in foreign 
        countries, nor is any material portion of its sales derived from 
        foreign countries.
 
Item 2  Properties

        The Registrant's position as a leading manufacturer of fasteners and 
        other components is due in large part to the efficiency of its
        manufacturing facilities.  Over the years, the Registrant has expanded
        and modernized its manufacturing plants and has invest substantial
        sums in order to maintain up-to-date production capacity. The 
        Registrant believes that its facilities both owned and leased, are in 
        excellent condition and are suitable and adequate to meet the desired
        levels of productive capacity.  Although there is minimal idle space, 
        major expansion is not planned for the near future.

Certain information relating to the principal properties of the Registrant is
set forth below:

     THIRD.  The nature of the business and the objects and

as natural persons might or could do, and in any part of the world,
viz:

     To engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations

on and engage in any and all lawful activities in any way
associated with the conduct of each business and the objectives and
purposes herein set forth.

or may be without voting powers; (b) may be subject to redemption
at such time or times and at such prices; (c) may be entitled to

assets of, the corporation; (e) may be made convertible into, or

     No stockholder, as such, shall have any preemptive right to
subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of stock or
securities convertible into or carrying warrants or options to

payment date, shall be and be deemed to be extinguished and
abandoned; and such unclaimed dividends in the possession of the
corporation, its transfer agents or other agents or depositaries,

disqualified member.

notice as is required by statute, or when authorized by the written
consent of the holders of no less than 66 2/3% of the voting stock

corporation shall so provide.

     EIGHTH.  The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter,
change or repeal any provision contained in this certificate of
incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statue,
and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted
subject to this reservation.

     NINTH. (a) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of
the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in
good faith and in a manner, he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action,
suit or proceeding by judgment order, settlement, conviction, or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.

     (b) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is
a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporations a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made
in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable (for negligence or misconduct
in the performance of his duty) to the corporation unless and only
to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the Court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery
or such other court shall deem proper.

     (c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in
paragraphs (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith.

     (d) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is
proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b).  Such
determination shall be made (1) by the board of directors by a
majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum
is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested
directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, or (5) by the stockholders.

     (e) Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer,
employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporations authorized in this Article.

     (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by or granted pursuant to the other sections of this Article shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may bet entitled under
any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity
and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

     (g) The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred
by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

     (h) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by, or granted pursuant to this Article shall, unless otherwise
provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person.

two-thirds of the Disinterested Directors.

     (2) All of the following conditions shall have been met:

their shares and the aggregate amount of the cash and the Fair
Market Value as of the date of consummation of the Business

shall be at least equal to the higher of the following:

     (i) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any
brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees)

the Interested Stockholder to acquire any common shares
beneficially owned by the Interested Stockholder which were
acquired (a) within the two year period immediately prior to the
first public announcement of the proposal of the Business
Combination (the "Announcement Date") or (b) in the transaction in
which it became an Interested Stockholder whichever is higher; and

     (ii) The Fair Market Value per common share on the first
trading date after the Announcement Date or on the first trading
date after the date of the first public announcement that the
Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder (the
"Determination Date"), whichever is higher.

     (B) The Business Combination shall provide for consideration
to be received by all holders of outstanding shares other than
common shares in exchange for all such shares and the aggregate
amount of the cash and the Fair Market Value as of the date of the
consummation of the Business Combination of consideration other
than cash to be received per share by holders of outstanding shares
other than common shares shall be at least equal to the highest of
the following (it being intended that the requirements of this
subparagraph (2)(b) shall be required to be met with respect to
every class and series of outstanding shares other than common
shares whether or not the Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate
or Associates of the Interested Stockholder has previously acquired
any shares of a particular class or series):

     (i) (if applicable) the highest per share price (including any
brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers fees)
paid by the Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate or Associate of
the Interested Stockholder to acquire any shares of such class or
series beneficially owned by the Interested Stockholder which were
acquired (a) within the 2-year period immediately prior to the
Announcement Date or (b) in the transaction in which it became an
Interested Stockholder, whichever is higher;

     (ii) (if applicable) the highest preferential amount per share
to which the holders of shares of such class or series are entitled
in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation;

     (iii) the Fair Market Value per share of such class or series

Determination Date, whichever is higher; and

     (iv) an amount equal to the Fair Market Value per share of
such class or series determined pursuant to clause (iii) times the
highest value obtained in calculating the following quotient for
each class or series of which the Interested Stockholder has
acquired shares within the 2-year period ending on the Announcement
Date: (x) the highest per share price (including any brokerage
commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid by
the Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate or Associate of the
Interested Stockholder for any shares of such class or series
acquired within such 2-year period divided by (y) the market value
per share of such class or series on the first day in such 2-year
period on which the Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate or
Associate of the Interested Stockholder acquired any shares of such
class or series.

     (C) The consideration to be received by holders of a
particular class or series of outstanding shares shall be in cash
or in the same form as the Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate
or Associate of the Interested Stockholder has previously paid to
acquire shares of such class or series beneficially owned by the
Interested Stockholder. If the Interested Stockholder and any
Affiliates or Associates of the Interested Stockholder have paid
for shares of any class or series with varying forms of
consideration, the form of consideration for such class or series
shall be either cash or the form used to acquire the largest number
of shares of such class or series beneficially owned by the
Interested Stockholder.

     (D) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested
Stockholder and prior to the consummation of such Business
Combination: (i) except as approved by two-thirds of the
Disinterested Directors, there shall have been no failure to
declare and pay at the regular date therefor any full periodic
dividends (whether or not cumulative) of any outstanding shares of
the corporation other than the common shares; (ii) there shall have
been (a) no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on the
common shares (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of
the common shares), except as approved by two-thirds of the
Disinterested Directors, and (b) an increase in such annual rate of
dividends (as necessary to prevent any such reduction) in the event
of any reclassification (including any reverse share split),
recapitalization, reorganization or any similar transaction which
has the effect of reducing  the number of outstanding common
shares; and (iii) such Interested Stockholder shall not have become
the beneficial owner of any additional Voting Shares except as part
of the transaction which results in such Interested Stockholder
becoming an Interested Stockholder.

     (E) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested
Stockholder, such Interested Stockholder shall not have received
the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a
stockholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other
financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages
provided by the corporation or any Subsidiary whether in
anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or
otherwise.

     (F) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed
Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations (or
any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations)
shall be mailed to public stockholders of the corporation at least
30 days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination
(whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to

     (c) For purposes of this Article Tenth:

     (1) "Business Combination" shall mean any of the following:

Associate of an Interested Stockholder;

     (B) any sale, lease, exchange: mortgage, pledge, transfer or

of any Interested Stockholder (other than the corporation or any
Subsidiary) of any assets of the corporation or any Subsidiary
having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined)

                        The Loan and The Project

         Section 2.1.  Municipality's Representations, Warranties, and
Covenants.

         (a)   The Municipality represents and warrants that:

          (i)  The Municipality is a duly organized and existing
   municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State of
   Indiana, with full power and authority under the Act to enter into
   the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out its
   obligations hereunder.

         (ii)  The Municipality has duly authorized the issuance,
   execution, and delivery of the Bonds and the execution and delivery
   of this Agreement.

         (b)   The Municipality covenants that:

          (i)  The Municipality shall not take any action to interfere
   with any obligation it may have with respect to the Bonds, the
   proceedings authorizing the Bonds or this Agreement.

         (ii)  The Municipality shall provide funds from the proceeds
   from the sale of the Bonds for the redemption and retirement of the
   1988 Bonds, and shall secure the payment of the Bonds by assigning
   this Agreement (except the right to receive payment for its
   expenses, the right to receive indemnities, and rights relating to
   any amendment of this Agreement) and the Note to the Trustee
   pursuant to the Indenture.

         Section 2.2.  Company's Representations, Warranties, and
Covenants.  The Company makes the following representations and warranties
(all as of the date on which this Agreement has been executed) and in
addition, makes the following covenants:

         (a)   It is a duly organized and validly existing corporation
   in good standing under the laws of the State of Indiana, has the
   power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on
   its business as now being conducted and as now contemplated, and has
   full power and authority to issue the Note and to execute and
   deliver this Agreement and the Indenture; all actions necessary for
   the execution and delivery of the Note, this Agreement, and the
   Indenture have been taken; and the Note will be a valid and binding
   obligation of the Company.

         (b)   The execution, delivery, and performance of this
   Agreement, the Note, and the Indenture will not conflict with or
   result in a breach of, or a default under, the Company's Articles of
   Incorporation, By-Laws, or any material agreement or instrument to
   which the Company is a party or by which it is bound (excepting,
   however, such agreements or instruments with respect to which the
   Company has been required to and has obtained waivers or consents)
   or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
   encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company,
   except for the lien of the Indenture.

         (c)   The 1988 Bonds were, to the best knowledge and belief of
   the Company, exempt from federal and State of Indiana income
   taxation when issued, as described in and subject to the limitations
   contained in the offering circular for the 1988 Bonds, the Company
   has no knowledge of any event occurring since the date of issuance
   of the 1988 Bonds that adversely affects that tax exempt status of
   the 1988 Bonds and the Company has received no notification of any
   such event from the Municipality, the trustee for the 1988 Bonds, a
   holder of a 1988 Bond, the Internal Revenue Service or the State of
   Indiana.

         (d)   The "average maturity" of the Bonds (taking into account
   their issue prices) does not exceed 120% of the remaining "average
   reasonably expected economic life" of the facilities originally
   financed with the proceeds of the 1988 Bonds (taking into account
   the respective cost of such facilities), all as determined in
   accordance with the provisions of Section 147(b) of the Code.

         (e)   No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to
   provide any facility the primary purpose of which is retail food and
   beverage service, automobile sales or services, or the provision of
   recreation or entertainment, any private or commercial golf course,
   country club, massage parlor, tennis club, skating facility
   (including roller skating, skateboard, and ice skating), racquet
   sports facility (including any handball or racquetball court), hot
   tub facility, suntan facility, racetrack, airplane, sky box or other
   private luxury box, health club facility, facility used for
   gambling, or facility used for the sale of alcoholic beverages.

         (f)   The Bonds are not and shall not be "federally
   guaranteed" as defined in Section 149(b) of the Code.

         (g)   The proceeds of the Bonds that will be used to acquire
   land (or any interest therein) will not exceed 24.9% of the net
   proceeds of the Bonds.  No portion of the proceeds other than those
   used to acquire land (or an interest therein) will be used to
   acquire any property (or an interest therein) where the first use of
   such property is not pursuant to such acquisition.

         (h)   The aggregate authorized face amount of the Bonds
   allocated to any "test period beneficiary," as such term is defined
   in Section 144 of the Code, when increased by the outstanding tax-
   exempt industrial development bonds of such beneficiary, does not
   and shall not exceed $40,000,000.

         (i)   The Company represents and warrants that it is the
   lawful owner of the Mortgaged Property, free and clear of all liens,
   security interests, charges, or encumbrances whatever except
   Permitted Encumbrances, and that the Company has full power and
   lawful authority to mortgage the Mortgaged Property and the real
   property improvements thereon to the Trustee; and that the Company
   has good and marketable title to the Mortgaged Property except
   Permitted Encumbrances and will preserve, warrant, and defend the
   same unto the Trustee against the claims of all persons and parties.

         (j)   The execution, delivery, and performance by the Company
   of this Loan Agreement and the Note do not require the consent or
   approval of, the giving of notice of, the registration with, or the
   taking of any other action in respect of, any federal, state or
   other governmental authority or agency, not previously obtained or
   performed.

         (k)   No litigation, environmental investigations, arbitration
   proceedings, or governmental proceedings are pending or threatened
   against the Company which would, if adversely determined, materially
   and adversely affect the financial condition or continued operations
   or properties of the Company and which the Company believes, after
   consulting with its counsel, are reasonably likely to be adversely
   determined.

         (l)   The Company will take no action which would (and will
   omit no action reasonably within its power, the omission of which
   would) cause the interest on the Bonds to become includable for
   Federal income tax purposes in the gross income of any Bondholder,
   other than a Bondholder who is a "substantial user" of the Project
   or a "related person" within the meaning and for the purpose of
   Section 147 of the Code.

         Section 2.3.  The Project.  The Company shall cause the Project
to continue to be used, throughout the term of this Agreement as an
"economic development facility" within the meaning of the Act.  The
failure or inability of the Company to use the Project, or to cause it to
be used, for the intended purposes shall not affect in any way the
Company's obligations under this Agreement or the Note and shall not be
deemed a breach or default under this Agreement as long as the use does
not affect the validity of the Bonds or result in the interest on the
Bonds becoming includable for federal income tax purposes in the gross
income of a Bondholder.

         Section 2.4.  Mortgage and Title Insurance.  As security for the
payment of the Bonds and the performance of its obligations under the
Indenture and the Note, the Company shall mortgage the Mortgaged Property. 
The Company shall provide an ALTA mortgagee's policy of title insurance
issued by a title insurance company reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
in an amount not less than $3,500,000, which policy shall be free and
clear of all exceptions except Permitted Encumbrances.  Any Net Proceeds
payable under such policy shall, at the Trustee's option, be either
(a) used to acquire and construct replacement or substitute property for
that to which title has been lost and such property shall be subject to
the lien of the Indenture, or (b) used to redeem the Bonds or portions
thereof on the earliest possible redemption date.

         Section 2.5.  Granting of Easements.  If no Event of Default
shall have happened and be continuing, the Company may at any time or
times, grant easements, licenses, rights-of-way (including the dedication
of public highways), and other rights or privileges in the nature of the
easements with respect to any property subject to the lien of the
Indenture, free from the lien of the Indenture, or release existing
easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other rights or privileges, with
or without consideration, and the Municipality and the Trustee shall
execute and deliver any instrument necessary or appropriate to confirm and
grant or release any such easement, license, right-of-way, or other right
or privilege upon receipt of:  (a) a copy of the instrument of grant or
release, (b) a written application signed by the Authorized Company
Representative requesting such instrument, (c) a certificate executed by
the Authorized Company Representative stating (i) that such grant or
release is not detrimental to the proper conduct of the business of the
Company, and (ii) that such grant or release will not impair the effective
use or interfere with the operation of the Mortgaged Property and will not
materially weaken, diminish or impair the security intended to be given by
or under the Indenture accompanied by a Certificate of an independent
architect or other expert reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the
effect that such grant or release will not materially and adversely affect
the operability of the Mortgaged Property.

         Section 2.6.  Release of Liens.  The Trustee shall, at the joint
written request of the Company and the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding (and without the necessity
of obtaining the consent of the Municipality), release any item of
collateral specified or referred to in the First or Second Granting Clause
of the Indenture from the lien of the Indenture.  The Municipality and the
Trustee shall execute and deliver any instrument necessary or appropriate
to confirm and grant any such disposition or release.

         In addition to the foregoing, the Trustee shall, without the
necessity for obtaining the consent of the Municipality or the
Bondholders, release from the lien of the Indenture the Mortgaged Property
or any portion thereof at any time and from time to time provided that the
Company first furnishes the Trustee with, in the event that a portion of
the Mortgaged Property is to be released, the items set forth in
paragraphs 1 and 2 below and, in the event that the entire Mortgaged
Property is to be released, the items set forth in paragraphs (1)(iii)
and (2) below:

         (1)   A certificate of the Company containing or stating, as
   the case may be (i) an adequate legal description of the portion of
   the Mortgaged Property to be released, (ii) an "as-built" survey of
   the portion of the Mortgaged Property to be released, (iii) that the
   Company intends to exercise its privilege of having such Mortgaged
   Property released, (iv) that the portion of the Mortgaged Property
   with respect to which the release is requested is not needed to
   operate the Project, or that the Company has reserved sufficient
   right, title, and interest to fulfill such needs, and (v) that the
   release will not materially impair ingress and egress to and from or
   the operating unity of the Mortgaged Property; and

         (2)   Either:  (i) cash equal to the current fair market value
   of the Mortgaged Property or portion thereof to be released (which
   value shall be determined by an independent appraisal), which cash
   shall be deposited in the Bond Fund under the Indenture and used for
   the purposes for which the Bond Fund exists as set forth in the
   Indenture including, to the extent possible, the redemption of Bonds
   prior to maturity, or (ii) a first mortgage lien in favor of the
   Trustee (which lien may be subject to Permitted Encumbrances) on
   real property owned and used in the operations of the Company or the
   Guarantor the value of which property (determined as of the date on
   which such property becomes subject to the mortgage lien described
   herein (the "Substitution Date")) is, in the reasonable opinion of
   the Trustee, who may rely on the opinion of an expert independent
   appraiser selected by the Trustee, at least equal in value to the
   value (determined as of the Substitution Date) of the Mortgaged
   Property or portion thereof to be released.  If the Company
   determines to provide the Trustee the mortgage lien described
   herein, the mortgage instrument shall be in a form reasonably
   acceptable to the Trustee and shall be accompanied by (i) a policy
   of title insurance in the full amount of the value of the property
   to be subject to the mortgage lien described herein, issued by a
   title insurance company that is both authorized to do business in
   Indiana and in all other respects reasonably acceptable to the
   Trustee, and providing coverage substantially similar to the
   coverage provided by the policy of title insurance issued with
   respect to the Mortgaged Property, and (ii) an opinion of counsel as
   to the validity and enforceability of the mortgage.

                               ARTICLE III
                  The Bonds, Use of Proceeds, The Note

         Section 3.1.  Agreement to Issue Bonds.  In order to provide
funds to make the Loan, the Municipality shall issue the Bonds and sell
them to the Purchaser and deposit the proceeds with the Trustee as
follows:

         (a)   Into the Bond Fund, the accrued interest, if any, paid
   by the Purchaser; and

         (b)   Into the Redemption Fund, the balance of the proceeds.

         Section 3.2.  Disbursements From Redemption Fund.  The Indenture
authorizes the Trustee to make payments from the Redemption Fund to INB
National Bank (f/k/a The Indiana National Bank) in its capacity as trustee
with respect to the 1988 Bonds and solely for the purpose of discharging,
redeeming and retiring the 1988 Bonds, provided, however, that any moneys
remaining in the Redemption Fund after such discharge, retirement,
redemption, and termination shall be promptly deposited in the Bond Fund. 
Payment as aforesaid shall be made upon receipt by the Trustee of all
materials and documents necessary to evidence to the satisfaction of the
Trustee that the funds being disbursed hereunder are sufficient to
discharge fully all obligations of the Company created and existing in
connection with the 1988 Bonds, together with all instruments and
documents necessary to evidence to the satisfaction of the Trustee the
discharge of all liens and encumbrances arising and existing by reason of
the 1988 Bonds.

         Section 3.3.  Company is Required to Pay in the Event Redemption
Fund is Insufficient.  In the event the moneys in the Redemption Fund
should not be sufficient to pay the costs of retiring, redeeming, and
discharging the 1988 Bonds in full, the Company shall pay that portion of
the costs in excess of the moneys available in the Redemption Fund.

         Section 3.4.  Investment of Redemption Fund and Bond Fund Moneys. 
Any moneys held as part of the Redemption Fund and the Bond Fund shall be
invested by the Trustee at the direction of the Company in Qualified
Investments which shall be direct obligations of the United States of
America or in other obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America.

         Section 3.5.  Covenants With Respect to Arbitrage.  The Company
and the Municipality covenant to each other and to and for the benefit of
the holders of the Bonds that no use will be made of the proceeds from the
issue and sale of the Bonds which, if such use could have been reasonably
expected on the date of issue of the Bonds, would have caused the Bonds to
be classified as arbitrage bonds under Section 103(b)(2) of the Code
(within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code).  As long as any Bonds are
outstanding, the Municipality and the Company shall not violate the
requirements of the Code relating to arbitrage bonds, and any regulations
thereunder, including the requirement of Section 148 of the Code relating
to the rebate of certain amounts to the United States government.  The
Company will provide to the Trustee instructions relating to the
permissible investment of Bond proceeds and instructions and computations
(using investment information provided by the Trustee) relating to the
amount required to be rebated to the United States, all in conformity with
Section 148 of the Code.  The Company reserves the right, however, to make
any investment of proceeds permitted under the laws of the State of
Indiana, if the sections of the Code relating to arbitrage bonds or the
regulations thereunder are repealed or relaxed or are held void by final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, so long as the investment
would not result in making the interest on the Bonds includable in the
gross income of the holders thereof for purposes of Federal income
taxation.  In making investments, the Company may rely on an opinion of
counsel of recognized competence in such matters.  The Trustee may make
any and all such investments through its own bond department.

         Section 3.6.  Loan Payments and Other Amounts Payable.

         (a)   Concurrently with the sale of the Bonds, the Company shall
execute and deliver the Note to the Municipality, pursuant to which the
Company shall make payments sufficient to pay when due (whether at
maturity, upon call for redemption, by acceleration or otherwise) the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds.  The Note shall
be issued as a fully registered note substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B.  The Trustee shall act as Note Registrar and shall
cause books for the registration and for the transfer of the Note to be
kept at its principal office.  Upon surrender for transfer of the Note at
the principal office of the Trustee, endorsed for transfer by the
registered owner or accompanied by an assignment executed by the
registered owner or his authorized attorney, the Trustee shall validate
and deliver in the name of the transferee a new Note which shall have been
executed by the Company.  The person in whose name the Note is registered
shall be deemed the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and
references to the holder of the Note shall mean the registered owner
thereof.

         (b)   The Company shall also pay when due (i) the reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses of the Trustee (including any reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses in its capacity as Note Registrar) and any
paying agent for services in connection with the Bonds as specified in
Section 903 of the Indenture, and (ii) the reasonable and necessary fees
and expenses of the Municipality, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in
connection with any default of the Company under this Agreement, the Note
or the Indenture.

         (c)   If the Company fails to make any of the payments required
in this Section 3.6 or in the Note, all unpaid items or installments shall
continue as an obligation of the Company until fully paid, and the Company
shall pay the same with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law)
until paid at a per annum rate of interest equal to the per annum rate
then in effect on the Bonds plus two percent (2%), or at the maximum rate
permitted by law, whichever is lesser.

         (d)   All payments under this Section 3.6 shall be made by the
Company directly to the Trustee in immediately available funds and the
Trustee shall deposit all such payments into the Bond Fund provided that
payments under Section 3.6(b) shall be made by the Company directly to the
person entitled thereto.  The amount of any money in the Bond Fund which
is either proceeds from the sale of any Bonds or earnings on investments
made pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture which has been set aside
by the Trustee, at the request of the Company, for payments of principal,
whether at maturity or upon redemption, of the Bonds shall be credited
against the obligation of the Company to pay the principal of the Note. 
The amount of any money in the Bond Fund which is either proceeds from the
sale of any Bonds or earnings on investments made pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture which has been set aside by the Trustee for
payments of interest on the Bonds shall be credited against the obligation
of the Company to pay interest on the Note.  The principal amount of any
Bonds purchased by the Company and delivered to the Trustee, or purchased
by the Trustee and cancelled, shall be credited against the obligation of
the Company to pay the principal of the Note.

         (e)   If on any principal or interest payment date the balance in
the Bond Fund is insufficient to make the required payments of principal
of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds on that date, the
Company upon notice shall pay forthwith any deficiency to the Trustee.

         (f)   The Company shall not be obligated to make any further
payments under this Section 3.6, and the Company's liability to make
payments under this Section 3.6 shall cease, at any time that the entire
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have
been fully paid in accordance with their terms and the provisions of
Section 1201 of the Indenture (including, without limitation, principal,
interest to maturity or earliest redemption date, as the case may be,
expenses of redemption, redemption premiums, and fees and expenses of the
Municipality, the Trustee and any paying agent and any other costs and
fees required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement), or at
any time that there shall be in the Bond Fund an amount sufficient to pay
or redeem the Bonds in accordance with the provisions of Section 1201 the
Indenture (including, without limitation, principal, interest to maturity
or earliest redemption date, as the case may be, expenses of redemption
and redemption premiums, and fees and expenses of the Municipality, the
Trustee and any paying agent and any other costs and fees required to be
paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement) and all other requirements
of Section 1201 of the Indenture have been satisfied in full.

         Section 3.7.  Obligation of Company Unconditional.  The
obligation of the Company to make the payments and to perform and observe
its other agreements pursuant to this Agreement and the Note shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be subject to reduction or delay
by set-off, counterclaim, abatement or otherwise.  Until such time as the
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have
been fully paid or provision for the payment thereof shall have been made
in accordance with Section 1201 of the Indenture (including, without
limitation, principal, interest to maturity or earliest redemption date,
as the case may be, expenses of redemption, redemption premiums, and fees
and expenses of the Municipality, the Trustee and any paying agent and any
other costs and fees required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement), and all other requirements of Section 1201 of the Indenture
have been satisfied in full, the Company (a) shall not suspend or
discontinue any payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Note, (b) shall
perform and observe all its other agreements contained in this Agreement
and the Note, and (c) except as provided in Article VII hereof, shall not
terminate this Agreement or the Note for any cause.  Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be construed to release the Municipality from the
performance of any of its obligations; and in the event the Municipality
shall fail to perform any such agreement on its part, the Company may
institute such action against the Municipality as the Company may deem
necessary to compel performance, provided that no such action shall
(i) violate the agreements on the part of the Company contained in the
first sentence of this Section 3.7 or (ii) diminish the amounts required
to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof.

                               ARTICLE IV
                   Particular Covenants of the Company

         Section 4.1.  Consent to Assignment to Trustee.  The Company
acknowledges and consents to the assignment of the Note and of the
Municipality's rights hereunder (except the right to receive payment for
its expenses, the right to receive indemnities and rights relating to any
amendments to this Agreement) to the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall pay to the Trustee
all amounts payable under this Agreement and the Note, and the Company
acknowledges that the Trustee may enforce the rights, remedies and
privileges granted to the Municipality hereunder.

         Section 4.2.  Payment of Expenses of Issuance of Bonds.  In
addition to its payment obligations under Section 3.6 of this Agreement,
the Company shall pay for all the reasonable costs and shall be liable and
pay for any recording expenses, legal fees, printing expenses and other
fees and expenses reasonably incurred or to be incurred by or on behalf of
the Municipality and the Trustee in connection with or as an incident to
the issuance and sale of the Bonds or any amendment or supplement to this
Agreement or the Indenture.

         Section 4.3.  Company to Maintain its Existence; Conditions Under
Which Exceptions Permitted.  The Company shall during the term of this
Agreement maintain its corporate existence and will be duly qualified to
transact business in the State of Indiana and shall not voluntarily take,
or omit to take, any action that would cause the Company to be dissolved,
nor shall the Company sell, lease transfer or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets or consolidate with or merge into another
corporation or permit one or more other corporations to consolidate with
or merge into it; except that the Company may consolidate with or merge
into another corporation incorporated and existing under the laws of the
United States of America or one of the states of the United States of
America or permit one or more other corporations to consolidate with or
merge into it or sell or otherwise transfer to another such corporation
all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety and may thereafter
dissolve, provided, that immediately after such action there is no default
under the Note, this Agreement or the Indenture, and further provided that
if the Company is not the surviving, resulting or transferee corporation
(the "Survivor"), the Survivor is (a) qualified to do business in the
State of Indiana and (b) shall expressly assume and agree to perform all
of the Company's obligations under this Agreement, the Note and the
Indenture.

         Section 4.4.  Further Assurances and Corrective Instruments.  The
Municipality and the Company shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such supplements hereto and further instruments as
may reasonably be required for carrying out the intention of or
facilitating the performance of this Agreement.

         Section 4.5.  Covenants of Company With Respect to Use of Bond
Proceeds.  The Municipality is issuing the Bonds pursuant to an exemption
contained in the Code.  It is the intention of the parties that the
interest on the Bonds remain excludable from gross income for purposes of
federal income taxation and to that end the Company covenants with the
Municipality and with the Trustee for the benefit of the future holders of
the Bonds, that it will never, insofar as it is able, permit Bond proceeds
to be expended or utilized in such a manner as to cause the loss of the
exclusion claimed other than as a result of previously unanticipated
capital expenditures.

         Section 4.6.  Indemnification of Municipality and Trustee.  The
Company shall indemnify and hold the Municipality and the Trustee harmless
against any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence
or bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Municipality or the
Trustee arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the
Indenture or the Project or Project Site, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and the costs and expense of defense against any such claim or
liability.

         Section 4.7.  Right of Access to Project.  The Municipality, the
Trustee, and any of their duly authorized agents shall have the right at
all reasonable times during normal business hours after reasonable prior
notice, subject to the Company's safety and security requirements, to
enter upon the Project Site and to examine and inspect the Project without
interference or prejudice to the Company's operation.  The Municipality
and its duly authorized agents shall have such right of access to the
Project as may be reasonably necessary for the proper maintenance of the
Project in the event of failure by the Company to perform its obligations
under Section 5.1 hereof.

         The Municipality and the Trustee shall not disclose to any other
person any trade secrets or other information designated by the Company as
confidential and obtained by the Municipality or Trustee from the above
mentioned inspection and examination.

         Section 4.8.  Insurance.  Subject to Article V of this Agreement,
the Company shall maintain such insurance as may be required by law and
such other insurance, to such extent and against such hazards and
liabilities, as is customarily maintained by companies similarly situated.

         Section 4.9.  Taxes and Liabilities.  Subject to Article V of
this Agreement, the Company shall pay when due all taxes, assessments and
other liabilities including trade accounts, except such as are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which
appropriate reserves have been established and, as to trade accounts,
subject to industry practices.

                    Maintenance, Taxes, and Insurance

         Section 5.1.  Maintenance and Modifications of Project by
Company.  The Company shall, during the Agreement Term and at its own
expense (a) keep the Project and the Project Site in as reasonably safe
condition as its operations shall permit, and (b) keep the Project in good
repair and in good operating condition, making from time to time all
necessary repairs thereto (including external and structural repairs) and
renewals and replacements thereof.  Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and the Indenture, the Company may, also at its own expense,
make from time to time any additions, modifications or improvements to the
Project, including specifically additions and expansions to the Project,
as it may deem desirable for its business purposes that do not materially
adversely affect the structural integrity of the Project or substantially
reduce its value; provided, that all such additions, modifications and
improvements to the Project shall be located wholly within the boundary
lines of the Project Site or any other real property owned by the Company
and made subject to the mortgage created by the Indenture and that is
subject to no liens, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind excepting
Permitted Encumbrances.

         The Company shall not permit any mechanic's lien, security
interest or other encumbrance to remain against the Project or the Project
Site for labor or materials furnished in connection with any additions,
modifications, improvements, repairs, renewals or replacements so made by
it; provided, that if the Company shall first notify the Trustee of its
intention so to do, the Company may in good faith contest any such
mechanic's or similar lien filed or established against the Project or the
Project Site and in such event may permit the items so contested to remain
undischarged and unsatisfied during the period of such contest and any
appeal therefrom unless the Municipality or the Trustee shall notify the
Company that, by non-payment of any such items, the lien of the Indenture
as to any part of the Project or the Project Site will be materially
endangered or the Project or the Project Site or any part thereof will be
subject to loss or forfeiture, in which event the Company shall promptly
pay and cause to be satisfied and discharged all such unpaid items or
shall promptly provide the Municipality and the Trustee with a bond or
other security, reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

         Section 5.2.  Taxes, Other Governmental Charges, and Utility
Charges.  The Company shall promptly pay, as the same become due, all
taxes and governmental charges of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
be lawfully assessed or levied against or with respect to the Project or
the Project Site, or any interest therein or any machinery, equipment or
other property installed or bought by the Company therein or thereon
(including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any taxes
levied upon or with respect to the revenues, income or profits of the
Company from the Project which if not paid, will become a lien on the
Project or the Project Site prior to or on a parity with the lien of the
Indenture and including all ad valorem taxes lawfully assessed upon the
Project or the Project Site), all utility and other charges incurred in
the operation, maintenance, use, occupancy and upkeep of the Project or
the Project Site and all assessments and charges lawfully made by any
governmental body for public improvements that may be secured by lien on
the Project or the Project Site.

         The Company may, at its expense and in its own name and behalf,
in good faith contest by appropriate proceedings any such taxes,
assessments and other charges and, in the event of any such contest, may
permit the taxes, assessments or other charges so contested to remain
unpaid during the period of such contest and any appeal therefrom,
provided during such period enforcement of any such contested item shall
be effectively stayed and appropriate reserves shall be established.

         Section 5.3.  Insurance Required.  The Company shall insure or
cause to be insured during the Agreement Term the Project and the Project
Site, against such risks as are customarily insured against by businesses
of like size and type, paying as the same become due all premiums in
respect thereto, including but not necessarily limited to:

         (a)   Insurance upon the repair or replacement basis if
   available, and otherwise to the full insurable value of the Project
   (with deductible provisions not to exceed $100,000 in any one
   casualty), against loss or damage by fire, lightning, windstorm,
   hail, explosion and similar risks and perils with uniform standard
   extended coverage endorsement limited only as may be provided in the
   standard form of extended coverage endorsement at the time in use in
   Indiana.

         (b)   Boiler explosion insurance on any steam boilers,
   pressure vessels and pressure piping in an amount not less than the
   full replacement cost of the Project (with deductible provisions not
   to exceed $100,000), provided that such insurance need not be taken
   out unless and until steam boilers, pressure vessels and pressure
   piping have been installed in the Project.

         (c)   Comprehensive general public liability insurance to the
   extent of $1,000,000 per occurrence against liability for bodily
   injury, including death resulting therefrom, and damage to property
   including loss of use thereof occurring on or in any way related to
   the Project or the Project Site or any part thereof.

         (d)   Worker's compensation and occupational disease coverage
   as required by the laws of the State of Indiana.

         Section 5.4.  Application of Net Proceeds of Insurance.  The Net
Proceeds of the insurance carried pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5.3(a) and (b) hereof shall be paid and applied as provided
in Section 6.1 hereof, and the Net Proceeds of insurance carried pursuant
to the provisions of Section 5.3(c) and (d) hereof shall be applied toward
extinguishment or satisfaction of the liability with respect to which such
insurance proceeds have been paid.

         Section 5.5.  Additional Provision Respecting Insurance.  All
insurance required in Section 5.3 hereof shall be taken out and maintained
in generally recognized responsible insurance companies selected by the
Company and qualified to do business in the State of Indiana.  All
policies evidencing such insurance shall provide for payment to the
Company and the Trustee, as their respective interest may appear, and
shall not be cancelled or modified without at least ten days' prior
written notice to the Trustee.  The policies required by Section 5.3(a)
and 5.3(b) shall contain standard mortgagee clauses requiring that all Net
Proceeds of insurance resulting from any claim in excess of $250,000 for
loss or damage covered thereby be paid to the Trustee; provided, however,
that all claims, regardless of amount, may be adjusted by the Company with
the insurers, subject to approval of the Trustee to the extent that its
interests may appear as to any settlement of any claim in excess of
$250,000.

         A certificate, or certificates, of the insurers that such
insurance is in force and effect, together with copies of the insurance
policies, shall be deposited promptly with the Trustee and, prior to the
expiration of any such policy, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with
evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that the policy has been renewed or
replaced, or is no longer required by this Agreement.  The insurance
herein required may be contained in blanket policies now or hereafter
maintained by the Company.

         Section 5.6.  Advances by Trustee.  In the event the Company
shall fail, as required herein, (a) to maintain the full insurance
coverage, (b) to keep the Project and the Project Site in a reasonably
safe condition as its operating condition will permit, (c) to keep the
Project in good repair and good operating condition, (d) to discharge any
mechanic's lien, security interest or other encumbrance, or (e) to pay all
taxes, other governmental charges and utility charges, the Trustee may
(but shall be under no obligation to) take out the required policies of
insurance and pay the premiums on the same, make the required repairs,
renewals and replacements, discharge the lien or other encumbrance or pay
all taxes, other governmental charges and utility charges; and all amounts
so advanced therefor by the Trustee shall become an additional obligation
of the Company to the Trustee, which amounts, together with interest
thereon (to the extent permitted by law) until paid until repaid at the
rate of one percent (1%) per annum over the prime rate (which prime rate
shall be the rate from time to time announced by the commercial banking
department of the Trustee or any of its affiliates to be its prime rate on
90-day commercial loans), or at the maximum rate permitted by law,
whichever is lesser, the Company shall pay.

                  Damage, Destruction, and Condemnation

         Section 6.1.  Damage and Destruction.  Unless the Company shall
have exercised its option to prepay the Note in full pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7.1 hereof, if prior to full payment of the Bonds
(or provision for payment thereof having been made in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture) the Project is destroyed (in whole or in
part) or is damaged by fire or other casualty to such extent that the
claim for loss under the insurance policies required to be carried
pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and (b) hereof resulting from such destruction
or damage is not greater than $250,000, the Company (a) shall promptly
repair, rebuild or restore the property damaged or destroyed to
substantially the same condition as it existed prior to the event causing
such damage or destruction, with such changes, alterations and
modifications (including the substitution and addition of other property)
as may be desired by the Company and as will not impair operating unity or
productive capacity or the character of the Project, and (b) shall apply
for such purpose so much as may be necessary of any Net Proceeds of
insurance resulting from such claims for losses, as well as any additional
moneys of the Company necessary therefor.  All Net Proceeds of insurance
resulting from such claims for losses not in excess of $250,000 shall be
paid to the Company.

         Unless the Company shall have exercised its option to prepay the
Note in full pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof, if prior to
full payment of the Bonds (or provision for payment thereof having been
made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) the Project is
destroyed (in whole or in part) or is damaged by fire or other casualty to
such extent that the claim for loss under the insurance policies required
to be carried pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and (b) hereof resulting from
such destruction or damage is in excess of $250,000, the Company shall
promptly give written notice thereof to the Trustee.  All Net Proceeds of
insurance resulting from such claims for losses shall be paid to and held
by the Trustee in a separate trust account, whereupon (i) the Company
shall proceed promptly to repair, rebuild or restore the property damaged
or destroyed to substantially the same condition as it existed prior to
the event causing such damage or destruction, with such changes,
alterations and modifications (including the substitution and addition of
other property) as may be desired by the Company and as will not impair
operating unity or productive capacity or the character of the Project,
and (ii) the Trustee shall apply so much as may be necessary of the Net
Proceeds of such insurance to payment of the costs of such repair,
rebuilding or restoration, either on completion thereof or as the work
progresses as directed by the Company.  In the event said Net Proceeds are
not sufficient to pay in full the costs of such repair, rebuilding or
restoration, the Company shall, nonetheless, complete the work thereof and
shall pay that portion of the costs thereof in excess of the amount of
said Net Proceeds. The Company shall not, by reason of the payment of such
excess costs (whether by direct payment thereof or advances to the Trustee
therefor), be entitled to any reimbursement from the Trustee, or the
holders or owners of the Bonds, or any abatement or diminution of the
amount payable under this Agreement.  Any balance of such Net Proceeds
remaining after payment of all the costs of such repair, rebuilding or
restoration shall be deposited into the Bond Fund.  If the Bonds have been
fully paid (or provision for payment thereof has been made in accordance
with the Indenture), any balance of such Net Proceeds shall be paid to the
Company.

         Any moneys held by the Trustee in the separate trust account
under the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall, at the written
request of the Authorized Company Representative, be invested or
reinvested by the Trustee as provided in Section 3.4 hereof.  The Company
shall forthwith pay to the Trustee the amount of any losses with respect
to principal on such investments.

         Section 6.2.  Condemnation.  Unless the Company shall have
exercised its option to prepay the Note in full pursuant to the provisions
of Section 7.1 hereof, in the event that title to, or the temporary use
of, the Project or the Project Site or any part thereof shall be taken
under the exercise of the power of eminent domain by any governmental body
or by any person, firm or corporation acting under governmental authority,
the Company shall be obligated to continue to make payments on the Note
and all other payments specified herein.  The Company and the Trustee
shall cause the Net Proceeds received by them or either of them from any
award made in such eminent domain proceedings to be paid to and held by
the Trustee in a separate trust account, and to be applied in one or more
of the following ways as shall be directed in writing by the Company:

         (a)   The prompt repair, restoration, relocation, modification
   or improvement of the Project and the Project Site, to substantially
   the same condition as existed prior to the exercise of said power of
   eminent domain.

         (b)   Redemption of the Bonds pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof;
   provided, that no part of any such condemnation award may be applied
   for such redemption, unless the Company shall furnish to the Trustee
   a certificate of the Authorized Company Representative stating
   (i) that the property forming a part of the Project or the Project
   Site that was taken by such condemnation proceedings is not
   essential to the Company's use or occupancy of the Project or the
   Project Site, or (ii) that the Project or the Project Site has been
   repaired, restored, relocated, modified or improved to a condition
   substantially equivalent to its condition prior to the taking by
   such condemnation proceedings.

         Unless the Company shall have exercised its option to prepay the
Note in full pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof within
ninety days from the date of entry of a final order in any eminent domain
proceedings granting condemnation, the Company shall direct the Trustee in
writing as to which of the ways specified in this Section 6.2 the Company
elects to have the condemnation award applied.  Any balance of the Net
Proceeds of the award in such eminent domain proceedings shall be paid
into the Bond Fund.  If the Bonds have been fully paid (or provision for
payment thereof has been made in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture), all Net Proceeds shall be paid to the Company.

         Any moneys held by the Trustee under the provisions of this
Section 6.2 shall, at the written request of the Authorized Company
Representative, be invested or reinvested by the Trustee in accord with
Section 3.4 hereof.  The Company shall forthwith pay to the Trustee the
amounts of any losses with respect to principal on such investments.

   an extension of the time prior to its expiration; provided, however,
   that with respect to this clause (c), if such failure of performance
   shall be such that it cannot be corrected within such period, it
   shall not constitute an Event of Default if such failure of
   performance, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee, is
   correctable without material adverse effect on the Bonds and if
   corrective action is instituted by or on behalf of the Company
   within such period and diligently pursued until such failure of
   performance is corrected.

         (d)   A decree or order shall have been entered by a court of

                  The Loan and The Project

        Section 2.1.  Municipality's Representations, Warranties, and
Covenants.

        (a)  The Municipality represents and warrants that:

         (i) The Municipality is a duly organized and existing
   municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State of
   Indiana, with full power and authority under the Act to enter into
   the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out its
   obligations hereunder.

        (ii) The Municipality has duly authorized the issuance,
   execution, and delivery of the Bonds and the execution and delivery
   of this Agreement.

        (b)  The Municipality covenants that:

         (i) The Municipality shall not take any action to interfere
   with any obligation it may have with respect to the Bonds, the
   proceedings authorizing the Bonds, or this Agreement.

        (ii) The Municipality shall provide funds from the proceeds
   from the sale of the Bonds for the redemption and retirement of the
   1988 Bonds, and shall secure the payment of the Bonds by assigning
   this Agreement (except the right to receive payment for its
   expenses, the right to receive indemnities, and rights relating to
   any amendment of this Agreement) and the Note to the Trustee
   pursuant to the Indenture.

        Section 2.2.  Company's Representations, Warranties, and
Covenants.  The Company makes the following representations and warranties
(all as of the date on which this Agreement has been executed) and in
addition, makes the following covenants:

        (a)  It is a duly organized and validly existing corporation
   in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, has the
   power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on
   its business as now being conducted and as now contemplated, and has
   full power and authority to issue the Note and to execute and
   deliver this Agreement and the Indenture; all actions necessary for
   the execution and delivery of the Note, this Agreement, and the
   Indenture have been taken; and the Note will be a valid and binding
   obligation of the Company.

        (b)  The execution, delivery, and performance of this
   Agreement, the Note, and the Indenture will not conflict with or
   result in a breach of, or a default under, the Company's Articles of
   Incorporation, By-Laws, or any material agreement or instrument to
   which the Company is a party or by which it is bound (excepting,
   however, such agreements or instruments with respect to which the
   Company has been required to and has obtained waivers or consents)
   or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge, or
   encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company,
   except for the lien of the Indenture.

        (c)  The 1988 Bonds were, to the best knowledge and belief of
   the Company, exempt from federal and State of Indiana income
   taxation when issued, as described in and subject to the limitations
   contained in the offering circular for the 1988 Bonds, the Company
   has no knowledge of any event occurring since the date of issuance
   of the 1988 Bonds that adversely affects that tax-exempt status of
   the 1988 Bonds and the Company has received no notification of any
   such event from the Municipality, the trustee for the 1988 Bonds, a
   holder of a 1988 Bond, the Internal Revenue Service, or the State of
   Indiana.

        (d)  The "average maturity" of the Bonds (taking into account
   their issue prices) does not exceed one hundred twenty percent
   (120%) of the remaining "average reasonably expected economic life"
   of the facilities originally financed with the proceeds of the 1988
   Bonds (taking into account the respective cost of such facilities),
   all as determined in accordance with the provisions of
   Section 147(b) of the Code.

        (e)  No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to
   provide any facility the primary purpose of which is retail food and
   beverage service, automobile sales or services, or the provision of
   recreation or entertainment, any private or commercial golf course,
   country club, massage parlor, tennis club, skating facility
   (including roller skating, skateboard, and ice skating), racquet
   sports facility (including any handball or racquetball court), hot
   tub facility, suntan facility, race track, airplane, skybox or other
   private luxury box, health club facility, facility used for
   gambling, or facility used for the sale of alcoholic beverages.

        (f)  The Bonds are not and shall not be "federally
   guaranteed" as defined in Section 149(b) of the Code.

        (g)  No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to
   acquire land (or an interest therein) or to acquire any property (or
   an interest therein) where the first use of such property is not
   pursuant to such acquisition.

        (h)  The aggregate authorized face amount of the Bonds
   allocated to any "test period beneficiary," as such term is defined
   in Section 144 of the Code, when increased by the outstanding tax-
   exempt industrial development bonds of such beneficiary, does not
   and shall not exceed $40,000,000.

        (i)  The Company represents and warrants that it is the
   lawful owner of the Project Site, free and clear of all liens,
   security interests, charges, or encumbrances whatever except
   Permitted Encumbrances, and that the Company has full power and
   lawful authority to mortgage the Project Site and the real property
   improvements thereon and grant a security interest in the Project
   Equipment to the Trustee; and that the Company has good and
   marketable title to the Project Site except Permitted Encumbrances
   and will preserve, warrant, and defend the same unto the Trustee
   against the claims of all persons and parties.

        (j)  The execution, delivery, and performance by the Company
   of this Loan Agreement and the Note do not require the consent or
   approval of, the giving of notice of, the registration with, or the
   taking of any other action in respect of, any federal, state, or
   other governmental authority or agency not previously obtained or
   performed.

        (k)  No litigation, environmental investigations, arbitration
   proceedings, or governmental proceedings are pending or threatened
   against the Company which would, if adversely determined, materially
   and adversely affect the financial condition or continued operations
   or properties of the Company and which the Company believes, after
   consulting with its counsel, are reasonably likely to be adversely
   determined.

        (l)  The financial statements of the Company as of June 30,
   1993, presented to the Purchasers, present fairly the financial
   condition of the Company and the results of its operations as of the
   date of such statements in accordance with generally accepted
   accounting principles and since such date there has been no material
   adverse change in the financial condition of the Company.

        (m)  The Company will take no action which would (and will
   omit no action reasonably within its power, the omission of which
   would) cause the interest on the Bonds to become includable for
   federal income tax purposes in the gross income of any Bondholder,
   other than a Bondholder who is a "substantial user" of the Project
   or a "related person" within the meaning and for the purpose of
   Section 147 of the Code.

        Section 2.3.  The Project.  The Company shall cause the Project
to continue to be used, throughout the term of this Agreement, as an
"economic development facility" within the meaning of the Act.  The
failure or inability of the Company to use the Project, or to cause it to
be used, for the intended purposes shall not affect in any way the
Company's obligations under this Agreement or the Note and shall not be
deemed a breach or default under this Agreement as long as the use does
not affect the validity of the Bonds or result in the interest on the
Bonds becoming includable for Federal income tax purposes in the gross
income of a Bondholder.

        Section 2.4.  Mortgage, Security Agreement, and Title Insurance. 
As security for the payment of the Bonds and the performance of its
obligations under the Indenture and the Note, the Company shall mortgage
the Project Site. The Company shall also grant a security interest in the
Project Equipment.  The Company shall provide an ALTA mortgagee's policy
of title insurance issued by a title insurance company reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser in an amount not less than $3,500,000 which
policy shall be free and clear of all exceptions except Permitted
Encumbrances.  Any Net Proceeds payable under such policy shall, at the
Trustee's option, be either (a) used to acquire and construct replacement
or substitute property for that to which title has been lost and such
property shall be subject to the lien of the Indenture, or (b) used to
redeem the Bonds or portions thereof on the earliest possible redemption
date.

        Section 2.5.  Granting of Easements.  If no Event of Default
shall have happened and be continuing, the Company may at any time or
times, grant easements, licenses, rights-of-way (including the dedication
of public highways), and other rights or privileges in the nature of the
easements with respect to any property subject to the lien of the
Indenture, free from the lien of the Indenture, or release existing
easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other rights or privileges, with
or without consideration, and the Municipality and the Trustee shall
execute and deliver any instrument necessary or appropriate to confirm and
grant or release any such easement, license, right-of-way, or other right
or privilege upon receipt of:  (a) a copy of the instrument of grant or
release, (b) a written application signed by the Authorized Company
Representative requesting such instrument, (c) a certificate executed by
the Authorized Company Representative stating (i) that such grant or
release is not detrimental to the proper conduct of the business of the
Company, and (ii) that such grant or release will not impair the effective
use or interfere with the operation of the Project and will not materially
weaken, diminish or impair the security intended to be given by or under
the Indenture accompanied by a Certificate of an independent architect or
other expert reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that such
grant or release will not materially and adversely affect the operability
of the Project.

        Section 2.6.  Release of Liens.  The Trustee shall, at the joint
written request of the Company and the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding (and without the necessity
of obtaining the consent of the Municipality), release any item of
collateral specified or referred to in the First, Second, or Third
Granting Clause of the Indenture from the lien of the Indenture.  The
Municipality and the Trustee shall execute and deliver any instrument
necessary or appropriate to confirm and grant any such disposition or
release.

        In addition to the foregoing, the Trustee shall, without the
necessity for obtaining the consent of the Municipality or the
Bondholders, release from the lien of the Indenture the Mortgaged Property
or any portion thereof at any time and from time to time provided that the
Company first furnishes the Trustee with, in the event that a portion of
the Mortgaged Property is to be released, the items set forth in
paragraphs 1 and 2 below, and in the event that the entire Mortgaged
Property is to be released, the items set forth in paragraphs (1)(iii)
and (2) below:

        (1)  A certificate of the Company containing or stating, as
   the case may be (i) an adequate legal description of the portion of
   the Mortgaged Property to be released, (ii) an "as-built" survey of
   the portion of the Mortgaged Property to be released, (iii) that the
   Company intends to exercise its privilege of having such Mortgaged
   Property released, (iv) that the portion of the Mortgaged Property
   with respect to which the release is requested is not needed to
   operate the Project, or that the Company has reserved sufficient
   right, title, and interest to fulfill such needs, and (v) that the
   release will not materially impair ingress and egress to and from or
   the operating unity of the Mortgaged Property; and

        (2)  Either:  (i) cash equal to the current fair market value
   of the Mortgaged Property or portion thereof to be released (which
   value shall be determined by an independent appraisal), which cash
   shall be deposited in the Bond Fund under the Indenture and used for
   the purposes for which the Bond Fund exists as set forth in the
   Indenture, including, to the extent possible, the redemption of
   Bonds prior to maturity or (ii) a first mortgage lien in favor of
   the Trustee (which lien may be subject to Permitted Encumbrances) on
   real property owned and used in the operations of the Company, the
   value of which property (determined as of the date on which such
   property becomes subject to the mortgage lien described herein (the
   "Substitution Date")) is, in the reasonably opinion of the Trustee,
   who may rely on the opinion of an expert independent appraiser
   selected by the Trustee, at least equal in value to the value
   (determined as of the Substitution Date) of the Mortgaged Property
   or portion thereof to be released.  If the Company determines to
   provide the Trustee the mortgaged land described herein, the
   mortgage instrument shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the
   Trustee and shall be accompanied by (a) a policy of title insurance
   in the full amount of the value of the property to be subject to the
   mortgaged land described herein, issued by a title insurance company
   that is both authorized to do business in Indiana and in all other
   respects reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, and providing
   coverage substantially similar to the coverage provided by the
   policy of title insurance issued with respect to the Mortgaged
   Property, and (b) an opinion of counsel as to the validity and
   enforceability of such mortgage.

        In addition to the foregoing, the Trustee shall, without the
necessity for obtaining the consent of the Municipality or the
Bondholders, release from the lien of the Indenture the Project Equipment
or any portion thereof at any time and from time to time provided that the
Company first furnishes the Trustee with cash equal to the value of the
portion of the Project Equipment to be released as determined by an
independent appraisal, which cash shall be deposited in the Bond Fund
under the Indenture and used for the purposes for which the Bond Fund
exists as set forth in the Indenture, including, to the extent possible,
the redemption of Bonds prior to maturity.

                         ARTICLE III
            The Bonds, Use of Proceeds, The Note

        Section 3.1.  Agreement to Issue Bonds.  In order to provide
funds to make the Loan, the Municipality shall issue the Bonds and sell
them to the Purchaser and deposit the proceeds with the Trustee as
follows:

        (a)  Into the Bond Fund, the accrued interest, if any, paid
   by the Purchaser; and

        (b)  Into the Redemption Fund, the balance of the proceeds.

        Section 3.2.  Disbursements From Redemption Fund.  The Indenture
authorizes the Trustee to make payments from the Redemption Fund to
National City Bank, Indiana (f/k/a Merchants National Bank & Trust Company
of Indianapolis), in its capacity as trustee with respect to the 1988
Bonds and solely for the purpose of discharging, redeeming, and retiring
the 1988 Bonds, provided, however, that any moneys remaining in the
Redemption Fund after such discharge, retirement, redemption, and
termination shall be promptly deposited in the Bond Fund.  Payment as
aforesaid shall be made upon receipt by the Trustee of all materials and
documents necessary to evidence to the satisfaction of the Trustee that
the funds being disbursed hereunder are sufficient to discharge fully all
obligations of the Company created and existing in connection with the
1988 Bonds, together with all instruments and documents necessary to
evidence to the satisfaction of the Trustee the discharge of all liens and
encumbrances arising and existing by reason of the 1988 Bonds.

        Section 3.3.  The Company is Required to Pay in the Event
Redemption Fund is Insufficient.  In the event the moneys in the
Redemption Fund should not be sufficient to pay the costs of retiring,
redeeming, and discharging the 1988 Bonds in full, the Company shall pay
that portion of the cost in excess of the moneys available in the
Redemption Fund.

        Section 3.4.  Investment of Redemption Fund and Bond Fund Moneys. 
Any moneys held as part of the Redemption Fund and Bond Fund shall be
invested by the Trustee at the direction of the Company in Qualified
Investments which shall be direct obligations of the United States of
America or in other obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America.

        Section 3.5.  Covenants With Respect to Arbitrage.  The Company
and the Municipality covenant to each other and to and for the benefit of
the holders of the Bonds that no use will be made of the proceeds from the
issue and sale of the Bonds which, if such use could have been reasonably
expected on the date of issue of the Bonds, would have caused the Bonds to
be classified as arbitrage bonds within the meaning of Section 103(b)(2)
of the Code.  As long as any Bonds are outstanding, the Municipality and
the Company shall not violate the requirements of the Code relating to
arbitrage bonds, and any regulations thereunder, including the requirement
of Section 148 of the Code relating to the rebate of certain amounts to
the United States government.  The Company will provide to the Trustee
instructions relating to the permissible investment of Bond proceeds and
instructions and computations (using investment information provided by
the Trustee) relating to the amount required to be rebated to the United
States, all in conformity with Section 148 of the Code.  The Company
reserves the right, however, to make any investment of proceeds permitted
under the laws of the State of Indiana, if the sections of the Code
relating to arbitrage bonds or the regulations thereunder are repealed or
relaxed or are held void by final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, so long as the investment would not result in making the
interest on the Bonds includable in the gross income of the holders
thereof for purposes of Federal income taxation.  In making investments,
the Company may rely on an opinion of counsel of recognized competence in
such matters.  The Trustee may make any and all such investments through
its own bond department.

        Section 3.6.  Loan Payments and Other Amounts Payable.

        (a)  Concurrently with the sale of the Bonds, the Company shall
execute and deliver the Note to the Municipality, pursuant to which the
Company shall make payments sufficient to pay when due (whether at
maturity, upon call for redemption, by acceleration or otherwise) the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds.  The Note shall
be issued as a fully registered note substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B.  The Trustee shall act as Note Registrar and shall
cause books for the registration and for the transfer of the Note to be
kept at its principal office.  Upon surrender for transfer of the Note at
the principal office of the Trustee, endorsed for transfer by the
registered owner or accompanied by an assignment executed by the
registered owner or his authorized attorney, the Trustee shall validate
and deliver in the name of the transferee a new Note which shall have been
executed by the Company.  The person in whose name the Note is registered
shall be deemed the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and
references to the holder of the Note shall mean the registered owner
thereof.

        (b)  The Company shall also pay when due (i) the reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses of the Trustee (including any reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses in its capacity as Note Registrar) and any
paying agent for services in connection with the Bonds as specified in
Section 903 of the Indenture, and (ii) the reasonable and necessary fees
and expenses of the Municipality, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in
connection with any default of the Company under this Agreement, the Note
or the Indenture.

        (c)  If the Company fails to make any of the payments required
in this Section 3.6 or in the Note, all unpaid items or installments shall
continue as an obligation of the Company until fully paid, and the Company
shall pay the same with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law)
until paid at a per annum rate of interest equal to the per annum rate
then in effect on the Bonds plus two percent (2%), or at the maximum rate
permitted by law, whichever is lesser.

        (d)  All payments under this Section 3.6 shall be made by the
Company directly to the Trustee in immediately available funds and the
Trustee shall deposit all such payments into the Bond Fund provided that
payments under Section 3.6(b) shall be made by the Company directly to the
person entitled thereto.  The amount of any money in the Bond Fund which
is either proceeds from the sale of any Bonds or earnings on investments
made pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture which has been set aside
by the Trustee, at the request of the Company, for payments of principal,
whether at maturity or upon redemption, of the Bonds shall be credited
against the obligation of the Company to pay the principal of the Note. 
The amount of any money in the Bond Fund which is either proceeds from the
sale of any Bonds or earnings on investments made pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture which has been set aside by the Trustee for
payments of interest on the Bonds shall be credited against the obligation
of the Company to pay interest on the Note.  The principal amount of any
Bonds purchased by the Company and delivered to the Trustee, or purchased
by the Trustee and cancelled, shall be credited against the obligation of
the Company to pay the principal of the Note.

        (e)  If on any principal or interest payment date the balance in
the Bond Fund is insufficient to make the required payments of principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds on that date, the Company
upon notice shall pay forthwith any deficiency to the Trustee.

        (f)  The Company shall not be obligated to make any further
payments under this Section 3.6, and the Company's liability to make
payments under this Section 3.6 shall cease, at any time that the entire
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have
been fully paid in accordance with their terms and the provisions of
Section 1201 of the Indenture (including without limitation, principal,
interest to maturity or earliest redemption date, as the case may be,
expenses of redemption, redemption premiums, and fees and expenses of the
Municipality, the Trustee, and any paying agent and any other costs and
fees required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement), or at
any time that there shall be in the Bond Fund an amount sufficient to pay
or redeem the Bonds in accordance with the provisions of Section 1201 the
Indenture (including without limitation, principal, interest to maturity
or earliest redemption date, as the case may be, expenses of redemption
and redemption premiums, and fees and expenses of the Municipality, the
Trustee and any paying agent and any other costs and fees required to be
paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement) and all other requirements
of Section 1201 of the Indenture have been satisfied in full.

        Section 3.7.  Obligation of Company Unconditional.  The
obligation of the Company to make the payments and to perform and observe
its other agreements pursuant to this Agreement and the Note shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be subject to reduction or delay
by set-off, counterclaim, abatement, or otherwise.  Until such time as the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall have been
fully paid or provision for the payment thereof shall have been made in
accordance with Section 1201 of the Indenture (including without
limitation, principal, interest to maturity or earliest redemption date,
as the case may be, expenses of redemption, redemption premiums, and fees
and expenses of the Municipality, the Trustee and any paying agent and any
other costs and fees required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement), and all other requirements of Section 1201 of the Indenture
have been satisfied in full, the Company (a) shall not suspend or

nor shall the Company sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of its assets or consolidate with or merge into

Project as may be reasonably necessary for the proper maintenance of the
Project in the event of failure by the Company to perform its obligations
under Section 5.1 hereof.

        The Municipality and the Trustee shall not disclose to any other

   event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each

   consolidated statement of income, and a consolidated statement of
   cash flow of the Company for such fiscal year, each of which shall
   be audited by the Company's independent public accountants.

        (b)  Quarterly Statements.  As soon as available, and in any

   Company as of the end of such quarter, a consolidated statement of
   income and a consolidated statement of cash flow of the Company for

   material conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
   consistently applied (except for changes in which the independent
   accountants for the Company concur), and present fairly the
   financial position of the Company as of the dates of such
   statements.

        (c)  No Default Certificate.  Concurrently with providing
   such financial statements, a certificate of the President, a Vice-
   President or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company that after
   reasonable investigation he has no knowledge of the occurrence of
   any Event of Default under this Agreement or the Indenture (or of
   any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice would
   constitute an Event of Default), or if such officer shall have
   obtained knowledge of any such Event of Default or default, he shall
   disclose the same in such certificate and the nature thereof.

              Maintenance, Taxes, and Insurance

        Section 5.1.  Maintenance and Modifications of Project by
Company.  The Company shall, during the Agreement Term and at its own
expense (a) keep the Project and the Project Site in as reasonably safe
condition as its operations shall permit, and (b) keep the Project in good
repair and in good operating condition, making from time to time all
necessary repairs thereto (including external and structural repairs) and
renewals and replacements thereof.  Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and the Indenture, the Company may, also at its own expense,
make from time to time any additions, modifications or improvements to the
Project, including specifically additions and expansions to the Project,
as it may deem desirable for its business purposes that do not materially
adversely affect the structural integrity of the Project or substantially
reduce its value; provided, that all such additions, modifications, and
improvements to the Project shall be located wholly within the boundary
lines of the Project Site or any other real property owned by the Company
and made subject to the mortgage created by the Indenture and that is
subject to no liens, restrictions, or encumbrances of any kind excepting
Permitted Encumbrances.

        The Company shall not permit any mechanic's lien, security
interest, or other encumbrance to remain against the Project or the
Project Site for labor or materials furnished in connection with any
additions, modifications, improvements, repairs, renewals, or replacements
so made by it; provided, that if the Company shall first notify the
Trustee of its intention so to do, the Company may in good faith contest
any such mechanic's or similar lien filed or established against the
Project or the Project Site and in such event may permit the items so
contested to remain undischarged and unsatisfied during the period of such
contest and any appeal therefrom unless the Municipality or the Trustee
shall notify the Company that, by nonpayment of any such items, the lien
of the Indenture as to any part of the Project or the Project Site will be
materially endangered or the Project or the Project Site or any part
thereof will be subject to loss or forfeiture, in which event the Company
shall promptly pay and cause to be satisfied and discharged all such
unpaid items or shall promptly provide the Municipality and the Trustee
with a bond or other security, reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

        Section 5.2.  Taxes, Other Governmental Charges, and Utility
Charges.  The Company shall promptly pay, as the same become due, all
taxes and governmental charges of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
be lawfully assessed or levied against or with respect to the Project or
the Project Site, or any interest therein or any machinery, equipment, or
other property installed or bought by the Company therein or thereon
(including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any taxes
levied upon or with respect to the revenues, income, or profits of the
Company from the Project which, if not paid, will become a lien on the
Project or the Project Site prior to or on a parity with the lien of the
Indenture and including all ad valorem taxes lawfully assessed upon the
Project or the Project Site), all utility and other charges incurred in
the operation, maintenance, use, occupancy, and upkeep of the Project or
the Project Site and all assessments and charges lawfully made by any
governmental body for public improvements that may be secured by lien on
the Project or the Project Site.

        The Company may, at its expense and in its own name and behalf,
in good faith contest by appropriate proceedings any such taxes,
assessments, and other charges and, in the event of any such contest, may
permit the taxes, assessments, or other charges so contested to remain
unpaid during the period of such contest and any appeal therefrom,
provided during such period enforcement of any such contested item shall
be effectively stayed and appropriate reserves shall be established.

        Section 5.3.  Insurance Required.  The Company shall insure or
cause to be insured during the Agreement Term the Project and the Project
Site, against such risks as are customarily insured against by businesses
of like size and type, paying as the same become due all premiums in
respect thereto, including but not necessarily limited to:

        (a)  Insurance upon the repair or replacement basis if
   available, and otherwise to the full insurable value of the Project
   (with deductible provisions not to exceed $100,000 in any one
   casualty), against loss or damage by fire, lightning, windstorm,
   hail, explosion, and similar risks and perils with uniform standard
   extended coverage endorsement limited only as may be provided in the
   standard form of extended coverage endorsement at the time in use in
   Indiana.

        (b)  Boiler explosion insurance on any steam boilers,
   pressure vessels, and pressure piping in an amount not less than the
   full replacement cost of the Project (with deductible provisions not
   to exceed $100,000), provided that such insurance need not be taken
   out unless and until steam boilers, pressure vessels and pressure
   piping have been installed in the Project.

        (c)  Comprehensive general public liability insurance to the
   extent of $1,000,000 per occurrence against liability for bodily
   injury, including death resulting therefrom, and damage to property
   including loss of use thereof occurring on or in any way related to
   the Project or the Project Site or any part thereof.

        (d)  Worker's compensation and occupational disease coverage
   as required by the laws of the State of Indiana.

        Section 5.4.  Application of Net Proceeds of Insurance.  The Net
Proceeds of the insurance carried pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5.3(a) and (b) hereof shall be paid and applied as provided in
Section 6.1 hereof, and the Net Proceeds of insurance carried pursuant to
the provisions of Section 5.3(c) and (d) hereof shall be applied toward
extinguishment or satisfaction of the liability with respect to which such
insurance proceeds have been paid.

        Section 5.5.  Additional Provision Respecting Insurance.  All
insurance required in Section 5.3 hereof shall be taken out and maintained
in generally recognized responsible insurance companies selected by the
Company and qualified to do business in the State of Indiana.  All
policies evidencing such insurance shall provide for payment to the
Company and the Trustee, as their respective interest may appear, and
shall not be cancelled or modified without at least ten (10) days' prior
written notice to the Trustee.  The policies required by Section 5.3(a)
and 5.3(b) shall contain standard mortgagee clauses requiring that all Net
Proceeds of insurance resulting from any claim in excess of $250,000 for
loss or damage covered thereby be paid to the Trustee; provided, however,
that all claims, regardless of amount, may be adjusted by the Company with
the insurers, subject to approval of the Trustee to the extent that its
interests may appear as to any settlement of any claim in excess of
$250,000.

        A certificate, or certificates, of the insurers that such
insurance is in force and effect, together with copies of the insurance
policies, shall be deposited promptly with the Trustee and, prior to the
expiration of any such policy, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with
evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that the policy has been renewed or
replaced, or is no longer required by this Agreement.  The insurance
herein required may be contained in blanket policies now or hereafter
maintained by the Company.

        Section 5.6.  Advances by Trustee.  In the event the Company
shall fail, as required herein, (a) to maintain the full insurance
coverage, (b) to keep the Project and the Project Site in a reasonably
safe condition as its operating condition will permit, (c) to keep the
Project in good repair and good operating condition, (d) to discharge any
mechanic's lien, security interest or other encumbrance, or (e) to pay all
taxes, other governmental charges, and utility charges, the Trustee may
(but shall be under no obligation to) take out the required policies of
insurance and pay the premiums on the same, make the required repairs,
renewals and replacements, discharge the lien or other encumbrance or pay
all taxes, other governmental charges and utility charges; and all amounts
so advanced therefor by the Trustee shall become an additional obligation
of the Company to the Trustee, which amounts, together with interest
thereon (to the extent permitted by law) until paid at the rate of one
percent (1%) per annum over the prime rate (which prime rate shall be the
rate from time to time announced by the commercial banking department of
the Trustee or any of its affiliates to be its prime rate on 90-day
commercial loans), or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is
lesser, the Company shall pay.

            Damage, Destruction, and Condemnation

        Section 6.1.  Damage and Destruction.  Unless the Company shall
have exercised its option to prepay the Note in full pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7.1 hereof, if prior to full payment of the Bonds
(or provision for payment thereof having been made in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture) the Project is destroyed (in whole or in
part) or is damaged by fire or other casualty to such extent that the
claim for loss under the insurance policies required to be carried
pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and (b) hereof resulting from such destruction
or damage is not greater than $250,000, the Company (a) shall promptly
repair, rebuild, or restore the property damaged or destroyed to
substantially the same condition as it existed prior to the event causing
such damage or destruction, with such changes, alterations, and
modifications (including the substitution and addition of other property)
as may be desired by the Company and as will not impair operating unity or
productive capacity or the character of the Project, and (b) shall apply
for such purpose so much as may be necessary of any Net Proceeds of
insurance resulting from such claims for losses, as well as any additional
moneys of the Company necessary therefor.  All Net Proceeds of insurance
resulting from such claims for losses not in excess of $250,000 shall be
paid to the Company.

        Unless the Company shall have exercised its option to prepay the
Note in full pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof, if prior to
full payment of the Bonds (or provision for payment thereof having been
made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) the Project is
destroyed (in whole or in part) or is damaged by fire or other casualty to
such extent that the claim for loss under the insurance policies required
to be carried pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and (b) hereof resulting from
such destruction or damage is in excess of $250,000, the Company shall
promptly give written notice thereof to the Trustee.  All Net Proceeds of
insurance resulting from such claims for losses shall be paid to and held
by the Trustee in a separate trust account, whereupon (i) the Company
shall proceed promptly to repair, rebuild, or restore the property damaged
or destroyed to substantially the same condition as it existed prior to
the event causing such damage or destruction, with such changes,
alterations and modifications (including the substitution and addition of
other property) as may be desired by the Company and as will not impair
operating unity or productive capacity or the character of the Project,
and (ii) the Trustee shall apply so much as may be necessary of the Net
Proceeds of such insurance to payment of the costs of such repair,
rebuilding, or restoration, either on completion thereof or as the work
progresses as directed by the Company.  In the event said Net Proceeds are
not sufficient to pay in full the costs of such repair, rebuilding, or
restoration, the Company shall, nonetheless, complete the work thereof and
shall pay that portion of the costs thereof in excess of the amount of
said Net Proceeds.  The Company shall not, by reason of the payment of
such excess costs (whether by direct payment thereof or advances to the
Trustee therefor), be entitled to any reimbursement from the Trustee, or
the holders or owners of the Bonds, or any abatement or diminution of the
amount payable under this Agreement.  Any balance of such Net Proceeds
remaining after payment of all the costs of such repair, rebuilding, or
restoration shall be deposited into the Bond Fund.  If the Bonds have been
fully paid (or provision for payment thereof has been made in accordance
with the Indenture), any balance of such Net Proceeds shall be paid to the
Company.

        Any moneys held by the Trustee in the separate trust account
under the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall, at the written
request of the Authorized Company Representative, be invested or
reinvested by the Trustee as provided in Section 3.4 hereof.  The Company
shall forthwith pay to the Trustee the amount of any losses with respect
to principal on such investments.

        Section 6.2.  Condemnation.  Unless the Company shall have
exercised its option to prepay the Note in full pursuant to the provisions
of Section 7.1 hereof, in the event that title to, or the temporary use
of, the Project or the Project Site or any part thereof shall be taken
under the exercise of the power of eminent domain by any governmental body
or by any person, firm, or corporation acting under governmental
authority, the Company shall be obligated to continue to make payments on
the Note and all other payments specified herein.  The Company and the
Trustee shall cause the Net Proceeds received by them or either of them
from any award made in such eminent domain proceedings to be paid to and
held by the Trustee in a separate trust account, and to be applied in one
or more of the following ways as shall be directed in writing by the
Company:

        (a)  The prompt repair, restoration, relocation,
   modification, or improvement of the Project and the Project Site, to
   substantially the same condition as existed prior to the exercise of
   said power of eminent domain.

        (b)  Redemption of the Bonds pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof;
   provided, that no part of any such condemnation award may be applied
   for such redemption, unless the Company shall furnish to the Trustee
   a certificate of the Authorized Company Representative stating
   (i) that the property forming a part of the Project or the Project
   Site that was taken by such condemnation proceedings is not
   essential to the Company's use or occupancy of the Project or the
   Project Site, or (ii) that the Project or the Project Site has been
   repaired, restored, relocated, modified or improved to a condition
   substantially equivalent to its condition prior to the taking by
   such condemnation proceedings.

        Unless the Company shall have exercised its option to prepay the
Note in full pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof within
ninety (90) days from the date of entry of a final order in any eminent
domain proceedings granting condemnation, the Company shall direct the
Trustee in writing as to which of the ways specified in this Section 6.2
the Company elects to have the condemnation award applied.  Any balance of
the Net Proceeds of the award in such eminent domain proceedings shall be
paid into the Bond Fund.  If the Bonds have been fully paid (or provision
for payment thereof has been made in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture), all Net Proceeds shall be paid to the Company.

        Any moneys held by the Trustee under the provisions of this
Section 6.2 shall, at the written request of the Authorized Company
Representative, be invested or reinvested by the Trustee in accord with
Section 3.4 hereof.  The Company shall forthwith pay to the Trustee the
amounts of any losses with respect to principal on such investments.

   Default if such failure of performance, in the reasonable opinion of
   the Trustee, is correctable without material adverse effect on the
   Bonds and if corrective action is instituted by or on behalf of the
   Company within such period and diligently pursued until such failure

the property, business and assets of such party associated with the
Products subject to this Agreement are transferred (such a
transferee being herein referred to as the "Corporate Successor");
provided, however, no such transfer may be made unless (i) the
transferring Stockholder shall first provide the other Stockholder
thirty days advance notice of its intention to transfer,
identifying the proposed Corporate Successor and the nature of the
transaction in connection with which the proposed transfer will
occur, (ii) no offer to sell has been made by the other Stockholder

Other Stockholder has accepted the offer of the Initiating
Stockholder to sell all of the Shares of the Initiating Stockholder

                            OPERATIONS

     7.1 Exclusive Manufacturing and Sales.  Except for the
provisions of the second paragraph of this Section 7.1, it is the
intent of the Stockholders that the Company shall have the
exclusive right to manufacture Products in the Territory for sale
to original equipment manufacturers in the Territory directly or
indirectly controlled by Japanese entities (such Japanese or
Japanese controlled manufacturers in the Territory hereinafter
"Japanese Manufacturers") and for sale to such Japanese
Manufacturers' Japanese controlled suppliers and subcontractors
("Japanese Suppliers") and Designated Suppliers in the Territory.
Except as permitted in the second paragraph of this Section 7.1,
Nagoya agrees that it shall not sell Products to such Japanese
Manufacturers in the Territory or their Japanese Suppliers or
Designated Suppliers in the Territory and shall not design or
manufacture Products for sale to such Japanese Manufacturers,
Japanese Suppliers or Designated Suppliers by third parties (other

to such Japanese Manufacturers in the Territory or such Japanese
Suppliers or Designated Suppliers in the Territory and shall not
design or manufacture Products for sale to such Japanese
Manufacturers, Japanese Suppliers or Designated Suppliers by third
parties (other than the Company).
     In the event the Company from time to time lacks the design,
manufacturing or production capability or otherwise chooses not to
manufacture Products for which it receives a specific inquiry, an
invitation to bid or an order from, or with respect to which it
understands inquiries, bids or solicitations will be considered by,
Japanese Manufacturers or Japanese Suppliers in the Territory, then
Nagoya or Elco may manufacture or sell such Products in response to
such specific inquiry, bid solicitation or order.  In the further
event, should a Japanese Manufacturer, Japanese Supplier or
Designated Supplier in the Territory indicate a preference to
purchase Products other than from the Company (and such preference
has not been solicited by or on behalf of Elco or Nagoya), then the
Company shall permit Elco and Nagoya and Elco and Nagoya shall be
entitled to manufacture and sell such Products to such Japanese
Manufacturer, Japanese Supplier, or Designated Supplier, and should
a non-Japanese controlled supplier or subcontractor to a Japanese
Manufacturer indicate a preference to purchase from the Company
rather than from Elco or any other person (and such preference has
not been solicited by or on behalf of the Company), then the
Company shall be permitted to manufacture and sell such Products to
such supplier and subcontractor.
     
     7.2. Technical Assistance.  Nagoya and Elco shall each
contribute to the Company without royalty all of their existing and
future Confidential Information, data and know how relating to the
manufacture and sale of the Products as may be reasonably useful to
the Company in conducting the Business of the Company, except that
the royalty to be paid by Elco as provided in the Technical
Assistance Agreement for products manufactured by Know-how as
defined therein shall continue thereunder until expiration of the
Technical assistance Agreement.  

     7.3. Confidentiality.  Nagoya and Elco to take appropriate
steps to keep, and will cause the Company to enter into an
agreement with them to keep, strictly secret and confidential and
not to disclose to any third party, any of the Confidential
Information, data or know-how acquired from the Company or from
each other, unless disclosure of such information is required by
law or permitted by any subsequent or supplemental agreement of
both of the parties hereto.
     
     7.4. Use of Information.  Nagoya and Elco each agree that it
shall not use, and agree that they will cause the Company to agree
not to use, any information described in Section 7.3 and obtained
from the other or from the Company, or in the case of use by the
Company, obtained by the Company from Nagoya or Elco for any
purpose whatsoever except in a manner expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Technical Assistance Agreement or any subsequent or
supplemental agreements.
     
     7.5. Exceptions to Confidentiality and Use Restrictions.

     Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
restrict or limit Elco's, Nagoya's or the Company's right to use,
disclose or otherwise dispose of any information which:
     (a) is in the possession of Elco or Nagoya, as the case may
be, prior to the disclosure of information to one of them by the
other after the date hereof, provided that if such possession was
obtained by one of them from the other in accordance with
agreements then or now existing, including the Technical Assistance
Agreement, such right of Nagoya or Elco shall be exercised in
accordance therewith; or
     (b) at the time of disclosure is or thereafter becomes,
through no act or failure to act on the part of Elco, Nagoya or the
Company, as the case may be, part of the public domain by
publication or otherwise.

     7.6. Office and Plant Site.  Elco presently leases property
commonly known as Brearley Plant #2, 5309 Eleventh Street,
Rockford, Illinois (the "Leased Premises') pursuant to an
industrial lease agreement dated August 2, 1984 between Elco, as
lessee, and Rowe Properties-Rockford, a Virginia limited
partnership, as lessor.  Subject to such consents of the lessor as
may be required, Nagoya and Elco shall cause the Company to enter
into a sublease with Elco covering approximately 49,600 square feet
of the Leased Premises upon the terms and conditions set out in the
Sub-Lease Agreement attached hereto as Appendix C.
     
     
                              TERMINATION

     8.1. Termination.  This Agreement shall continue in effect
until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or until
either party hereto transfers all of its shares in the Company
pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof; provided, however, that if either
party suspends payment of its debts or enters into or becomes
subject to corporate rehabilitation procedures, liquidation,
dissolution or bankruptcy proceedings, or shall make a composition
with its creditors, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of
its creditors, or shall seek relief under any similar laws for
debtor's relief, then the other party, at its option, may thereupon
immediately terminate this Agreement.

     8.2. Discontinuance of Name.  In the event of a purchase and
sale provided for in Section 6.3 of this Agreement, the name of the
Company shall be promptly changed so that it does not contain the
word "Elco" if Elco is the selling Stockholder and does not contain
the word "Nagoya" if Nagoya is the selling stockholder.

     8.3 Change of Law.  In the event there is a new, or a change
in any, law or administrative regulation or ruling or action of any
administrative agency of either Japan or the United States or a
decision of a court having jurisdiction over either of the parties
hereto or a consent decree under the United States or Japanese
antitrust laws binding upon Nagoya or Elco, which requires
modification of this Agreement in a way which would be unacceptable
to either party, then such party  may request the other to
renegotiate in good faith the terms of this Agreement so as to
conform to such new or changed law, regulation, ruling or action,
court decision or consent decree in a way which will be acceptable
to both parties.
     In the event that an agreement cannot be reached by the
parties within ninety (90) days after such renegotiations have
commenced, either party may, by written notice to the other,
terminate this Agreement.  

     8.4. Dissolution.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any
reason, other than when a party voluntarily ceases to be a
Stockholder through sale of its shares in the Company to the other
party or through transfer to a Corporate Successor pursuant to
Section 6.2, the Company shall, unless the parties hereto otherwise
agree in writing, be dissolved and liquidated and the assets
thereof shall be divided and distributed as promptly as reasonably
possible among its stockholders in proportion to their then
respective stock interests in the Company.

     8.5. Force Majeure.  Neither of the parties shall be liable on
any account for any failure to fulfill any terms of this Agreement,
if such fulfillment has been delayed, hindered or prevented by
force majeure, including strikes, riots, lockouts, civil commotion
or any other unforeseeable supervening event of whatever nature
beyond the control of the party asserting the provisions of this
Section.  If such event of force majeure continues uninterrupted
for a period of six (6) months, either Nagoya or Elco may, at its
option, terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other.

     8.6. Survival of Obligations.  Termination of this Agreement
and/or the dissolution of the Company for any cause shall not
release either party from any other liability which at the time of
termination and/or dissolution has already occurred to the other
party, nor affect in any way the survival of the rights, duties and
obligations of either party provided for in Sections 7.3, 7.4, 8.2,
9.1 and 9.2.

                            ARBITRATION

     9.1. Arbitration.  All disputes, controversies or differences
which may arise between the parties, out of or in relation to or in
connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be
finally settled by arbitration pursuant to the Japan-American Trade
Arbitration Agreement of September 16, 1952, by which each party
hereto is bound; provided, however, that neither party shall
initiate arbitration without first having given the other party
sixty (60) days prior notice thereof so as to afford the parties
the opportunity amicably to resolve their differences.

     9.2. Place and Conduct of Arbitration.  The place of
arbitration shall be a place designated by mutual agreement of the
parties, provided that if the parties fail to agree on a place
within two weeks after the expiration of the sixty (60) day period
provided in Section 9.1 above after arbitration is requested in
writing by a party, then the arbitration will be held in London,
England. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the arbitration
shall be conducted under the Rules of the London Court of
International Arbitration.  The arbitration tribunal shall consist
of three arbitrators, each party to appoint one "neutral"
arbitrator of its choice, and the third arbitrator, who shall not
be a citizen or national of Japan or the United States and shall
act as the chairman of the arbitration tribunal, shall be appointed
by the two arbitrators appointed by the parties.  If the parties
hereto shall fail to appoint their respective arbitrators or the
two appointed arbitrators fail to appoint the third arbitrator
within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the arbitration, the
arbitrator or arbitrators shall then be selected by the London
Court of Arbitration in accordance with its rules.  The decision
and award rendered by the arbitration tribunal shall be final and
binding upon the parties, who hereby agree that the award shall be
enforceable in both Japan and the United States and any other
country which would recognize the award under its domestic law. 
The parties agree that the arbitration tribunal shall award the
costs of arbitration, including the arbitration tribunal fees and
the legal fees of the parties to the loser provided that, in cases
where the award is a compromise of the parties' position, the
arbitration tribunal shall allocate the costs as it deems
appropriate.

corporation and directors in question shall be severally under the
duty of disclosing all material facts as to their interest to the
remaining directors promptly if and when such interested officers
or such interested directors in question shall become advised of
the circumstances.  In the case of continuing relationships in the
normal course of business such disclosure shall be deemed
effective, when once given, as to all transactions and contracts
subsequently entered into.
     
     SECTION 3.5. Dividends and Reserves.  Dividends upon stock of
the corporation may be declared by the Board of Directors at any
regular or special meeting, pursuant to law.  Dividends may be paid

of the Board of Directors, the presence of an even number of
directors but in no event fewer than four directors, no fewer than
two of whom shall be directors elected by holders of the Class A
Common Stock and two of whom shall be directors elected by holders
of the Class B Common Stock, shall be necessary and sufficient to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Each director
shall have one vote, except that the Chairman of the Board shall
have two votes.   Every reference in these by-laws and in the
certificate of incorporation to a majority or other proportion of
directors (except for purposes of establishing a quorum) shall
refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such
directors.  The act of a majority of the directors present at any
meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of
Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by
statute or these by-laws.  If a quorum shall not be present at any
meeting of directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

provided by statute, a director of the corporation who is present
at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action is taken on
any corporate matter shall be presumed to have assented to the
action taken unless his dissent shall be entered in the minutes of
the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent to such
action with the person acting as Secretary of the meeting before
the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered
mail to the Secretary of the corporation immediately after the
adjournment of the meeting.  Such right to dissent shall not apply
to a director who voted in favor of such action.

corporation shall, in the performance of his duties, be fully
protected in relying in good faith upon the books of account or
reports made to the corporation by any of its officials, or by an

relying in good faith upon other records of the corporation,
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
records setting forth or relating to the value and amount of
assets, liabilities and profits of the corporation or any other
facts pertinent to the existence and amount of surplus or other
funds from which dividends might properly be declared or paid or
with which stock of the corporation might lawfully be purchased or
redeemed.
     
     SECTION 3.15. Translator.  Any director may be accompanied by

                       Form of Sublease Agreement
     <PAGE>
                    SUBLEASE AGREEMENT
     
     
     
     This Sublease Agreement dated the 25th day of July 1989, is
entered into by and between Elco Industries, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, having an office at 1111 Samuelson Road, Rockford,
Illinois 61125 (hereinafter referred to as "Sublessor") and Rocknel
Fastener, Inc., a Delaware corporation, having an office at 5309
11th Street Rockford, Illinois 61125 (hereinafter referred to as
"Sublessee").
     
     WHEREAS, Sublessor is the tenant of Rowe Properties Rockford,
a Virginia limited partnership, having an office at Suite 920, 1001
East Main Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 (hereinafter referred to
as "Landlord"), consisting of approximately 174,652 square feet of
office, warehouse and manufacturing space and related parking and
surrounding grounds, located at 5309 11th Street, Rockford,
Illinois 61125 (the "Premises"); and
     
     WHEREAS, Sublessor's leasehold interest is set forth in a
Lease Agreement dated as of August 2, 1984 (which is hereinafter
referred to as the "Lease") and is incorporated herein, and
attached hereto, as Exhibit A; and
     
     WHEREAS, Sublessor desires to sublease the premises outlined
on the floor plan, attached as Exhibit B, consisting of
approximately 49,600 square feet (hereinafter referred to as the
"Demised Premises") to Sublessee; and
     
     WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublease the Demised Premises
from Sublessor;
     
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration,
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, it is
mutually agreed as follows:
     
     1. This Sublease Agreement (hereinafter referred to as
"Sublease"), is made subject and subordinate to the Lease.  The
Lease is hereby incorporated into this Sublease by reference with
the effect that whenever the term "Tenant" occurs in the Lease,
said term will mean Sublessee, and whenever in the Lease the term
"Landlord" occurs, said term will mean Sublessor; provided,
however, that such references as far as Sublessee's and Sublessor's
obligations hereunder are concerned shall be limited and pertain
solely to the Demised Premises.  Sublessee and Sublessor accept
this Sublease subject to, and hereby assume and agree to perform
and observe, all of the terms, covenants and conditions contained
in the Lease, as if Sublessee originally had been named as the
tenant therein and as if Sublessor originally had been named as the
landlord therein; provided, however, Sublessee shall not be
obligated to pay monetary charges under the Lease unless otherwise
specified herein.  All items of the Lease as to the Demised
Premises, shall remain in full force and effect and will inure to
the benefit of Sublessee and Sublessor, except as otherwise
provided herein:
     
     Notwithstanding anything hereunder contained to the contrary,
however, whenever the Sublease shall be in conflict with, the
Sublease shall be deemed superior and prevailing:
     
     (a) Sublessor hereby subleases the Demised Premises to
Sublessee and Sublessee hereby accepts the Demised Premises from
Sublessor.
     
     (b) The term of said Sublease and possession of the Demised
Premises shall commence on April 1, 1989 and shall terminate at
11:59 P.M. on August 31, 1996.
     
     (c) Commencing on April 1, 1989 and on the first day of each
month thereafter, Sublessee shall pay rent to Sublessor, in equal
monthly installments, each equal to one-twelfth of the annual rents
set forth in the table contained in Exhibit C.
     
     A late charge of five percent (5%) of all amounts then due to
Sublessor shall be immediately due and payable to Sublessor as
additional rent for each and every month in which rental payments
are not received by Sublessor on or before the 7th day of the
month.  If Sublessor has not received payment of rental by the 5th
day of the month, it will attempt to orally so notify Sublessee.
Failure to so notify Sublessee shall not affect any of Sublessee's
duties or obligations hereunder, in any manner whatsoever.
     
     In addition, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor with each rental
payment, an amount equal to 1/12 of Sublessee's proportionate share
(based upon the percentage of square footage the Demised Premises
contains relative to the total square footage of the Premises) of
any Taxes attributable to the Premises and of any operating
expenses or costs or charges or insurance premiums attributable to
the Premises, other than costs such as capital improvements to
portions of the Premises which do not in any way affect or benefit
or enhance the value of the Demised Premises, it being understood
that the annual rent shall be absolutely net to Sublessor.  All
such costs, expenses, charges and Taxes shall be deemed to be
additional rent due to Sublessor.
     
     (d) Upon termination of the Sublease by lapse of time or
otherwise, Sublessee shall immediately vacate the Demised Premises
and return and surrender same to Sublessor in the same condition as
exists on the date hereof, ordinary wear and tear excepted and at
Sublessor's option, Sublessee shall remove any leasehold
improvements installed by or constructed by Sublessee. Sublessee
shall repair all damage to the Demised Premises except for any
damage caused by (a) fire or other casualty for which the Demised
Premises are fully insured or (b) the Landlord or Sublessor.  In
the event the Landlord under the Lease shall require, pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the Lease, the removal from the
Demised
Premises at the termination of this Sublease of any property placed
in or upon the Demised Premises by Sublessee, such removal and the
cost thereof shall be the sole responsibility of the Sublessee.  If
Sublessee shall fail to remove said property, if required to do so
aforesaid, then at Sublessor's sole option it may remove the same
at Sublessee's sole cost, or upon Sublessor's election, title to
said property shall pass to Sublessor without any further
consideration therefor.
     
     (e) Sublessee shall obtain comprehensive general liability
insurance in the amount of not less than Five hundred thousand
Dollars ($500,000.00), combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage liability claims with an insurance carrier
reasonably acceptable to Sublessor.  Certificates of Insurance
shall be provided to Sublessor evidencing such coverage on a
continuing basis.  Sublessee's personal property and such leasehold
improvements as are made by Sublessee shall be at Sublessee's sole
risk, and Sublessee shall observe and comply with all indemnity
provisions of the Lease only as to the Demised Premises.  Sublessor
shall be indemnified and included as an additional insured in the
same manner as the Landlord under the insurance provided hereunder.
     
     (f) Sublessor shall have the same rights and duties under this
Sublease in respect to the Sublessee as the Landlord has under the
Lease in respect to the Tenant, subject, however, to all of the
provisions contained herein.
     
     (g) Sublessee shall have the same rights and duties under this
Sublease in respect to the Sublessor as the Tenant has under the
Lease in respect to the Landlord, subject, however, to all of the
provisions contained herein.
     
     (h) Sublessor agrees that upon receipt from Sublessee of
written notice of any default of any obligation or duty of the
Landlord under the Lease, to notify the Landlord of Sublessee's
notice in order for Landlord to rectify or fulfill any default,
obligation or duty as listed in Sublessee's notice.  Sublessor
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Landlord to
rectify or fulfill any default, existing obligation or duty under
the Lease.
     
     (i) Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor monthly and be
responsible for any charges for utility and other services (other
than electricity, gas and water metered separately to the Demised
Premises) used by Sublessee at the Demised Premises to the extent
that Sublessee would be required to pay such charges under the
Lease if Sublessee were the Tenant thereunder, unless the Demised
Premises are separately metered for utilities.
     
     (j) Sublessor and Sublessee agree to timely and fully perform
all of their obligations under this Sublease and the Lease.
     
     (k) The Demised Premises are to be used for office, warehouse
and manufacturing operation consisting of the manufacture of nuts,
bolts, screws and similar parts, and uses incidental thereto only.
     
     2. Provided Sublessee is not in default under the terms
hereof, and provided that Sublessor elects to exercise any of the
options contained in paragraph 4 of the Lease, Sublessee may extend
the term of this Sublease for a term equal to (less one day) the
term of any extension in accordance with the provisions of said
paragraph 4.  It is expressly agreed that Sublessor shall have no
obligation to exercise any such extension option. The Annual Rent
for any extension term shall be Sublessee's proportionate share of
the Annual Rent described in paragraph 4.
     
     3. Sublessee shall not have the right to contest or review
Taxes as set forth in paragraph 10.4 of the Lease.  In the event
that Sublessor elects to contest or review Taxes (it being agreed
that Sublessor is under no obligation to do so), Sublessee shall
pay to Sublessor when billed, its proportionate share of the cost
of any such contest or review and shall share proportionately in
the amount of any reduction or savings attributable to any year of
the term of this Sublease.
     
     4. The provisions of paragraph 11.2 of the Lease shall not
apply to this Sublease.
     
     5. Sublessee shall be entitled to the use by its employees and
invitees of 35 parking spaces in any area or areas to be designated
by Sublessor, subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as
Sublessor may from time to time promulgate.
     
     6. Sublessee shall hold Sublessor harmless from and defend and
indemnify Sublessor against any claims, costs, liabilities or
expenses of any kind (including attorneys' fees) for any injury or
damages to any person or property whatsoever and from any remedial
or preventive action asserted by any governmental agency or
authority related to illegal or unlawful use, accumulation, storage
or discharge, spill or escape or emission of hazardous or toxic
waste or hazardous or toxic material or contamination resulting
therefrom or pollution or any other environmental hazard or
condition (whether or not the same may be lawful on the date
hereof) arising out of, or occurring in or about the Demised
Premises, or the Premises, caused in whole or in party by the act,
negligence, fault or omission by Sublessee, its employees,
customers, invitees or assignees.  This indemnity shall survive the
termination or expiration of this Sublease.
     
     7. It is expressly agreed that this Sublease may not be
assigned and that the Demised Premises may not be sublet, in whole
or in part, by Sublessee without the prior written consent of
Sublessor and the Landlord under the Lease.  The consent of
Sublessor to any proposed sublease may be withheld in the sole
discretion of Sublessor, or may be granted subject to such
conditions as Sublessor in its sole discretion may require.
     
     8. This Sublease shall be of no force or effect until the
Landlord has given its consent hereto. Sublessee and Sublessor
shall use their reasonable best efforts to secure said consent.
     
     9. The Sublessee agrees to take the Demised Premises in "AS
IS" condition and agrees to install all improvements required by it
at its own expense, in conformance to the Lease and all rules,
regulations and requirements of the Landlord.  Sublessee has
examined the Demised Premises prior to the execution and delivery
of this Sublease and has found it to be satisfactory.  No
representation, warranty or agreements is made by Sublessor to
Sublessee concerning the condition of the Demised Premises or any
of the equipment, furnishings, or fixtures, if any, installed
therein the taking of possession by Sublessee shall be conclusive
evidence that the Demised Premises were in satisfactory condition.
     
     10. Sublessor hereby represents to the Sublessee that it is
not in default of any provisions under the Lease, that the Lease is
in full force and effect, that it is still the Tenant under the
Lease, that it has the right under the Lease to enter into this
Subleases subject only to obtaining the consent of Landlord, that
a copy of the Lease attached hereto is a true, correct and complete
copy of the document it purports to represent and that it will not
alter, amend, terminate or cancel the Lease as to the Demised
Premises without first obtaining the written consent of Sublessee,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Sublessor further
represents to the Sublessee that to the best of its knowledge and
belief, the Landlord is not in default under the Lease and no
conditions exist which, with the passage of time or
the giving of notices or both would render the Landlord in default
under the Lease.
     
     11. All notices provided for hereunder shall be in writing and
personally delivered or sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt request to the Sublessor at its address first above

Berner, Jr./Mary L. Milano and to Sublessee at its address first
above written, Attention: President, with a copy to Vice President.
All notices shall be effective upon the earlier of actual receipt
or the next business day following postmark.
      
     12. Any event of default set forth in paragraph 24 of the
Lease, or elsewhere therein, which is not cured within the time
allowed by the Lease shall be an event of default hereunder, as if
Sublessor were the Landlord and Sublessee were the Tenant
thereunder.
     
     13. In the event Sublessee shall remain in possession of the
Demised Premises after the termination of the Lease, Sublessee
shall be liable for the greater of (a) rental in an amount equal to
twice the monthly rental installments set forth herein for each
month or fraction thereof during which Sublessee remains in
possession of the Demised Premises, or (b) all obligations of
Sublessor, including but not limited to any liability, rent,
damages, costs or penalties relating to the Demised Premises which
may be recovered by the Landlord under the Lease or which are
attributable to the Sublessee's holdover.
     
     14. This Sublease shall automatically terminate on the
termination, cancellation or expiration of the Lease between
Landlord and Sublessor.
     
     15. Sublessor will send a copy of any termination notice
received by it from Landlord and any notice sent by it to the
Landlord regarding voluntary termination, contemporaneously with
same being received from or sent to the Landlord.
     
     16. If Sublessor declines to prosecute any material claim or
material cause of action against Landlord and the same materially
affects the Demised Premises, Sublessor shall assign same to
Sublessee, however, Sublessee shall have no obligations to
prosecute same.
     
     17. Sublessee shall have the right, subject to Sublessor's and

June 27, 1989

Mr. Akira Okabe, President
Okabe Company Limited 
21-15 Mukohjima 4-Chome Sumida-Ku
Tokyo, Japan

Dear Mr. Okabe:

Thank you for your letter of May 30, 1989.  Since then Mr. Ohno has
spoken to me about your plans and interests generally with respect
to your investment in Elco.  I believe I now have a clearer
understanding of your wishes.

It is now my understanding that, conditioned upon approval by the
Elco board of directors for you to increase your ownership of Elco
stock to no more than 21% of Elco's outstanding shares, you agree
to the following on behalf of yourself and your group:

      1. For ten years from the date the board approves your
increase to 21%, you and your group will not directly or indirectly
own or acquire any stock of Elco if the effect of the ownership or
acquisition would be to increase the aggregate voting power of you
and your group to greater than 21% of the total combined voting
power of the Elco stock then outstanding.

      2.  Any time you or your group wishes to sell any or all of
your stock, you will first offer the stock to Elco at whatever
price a third party in good faith is then offering to purchase the
stock from you or, if there is no pending offer from a third party,
at the closing bid price on NASDAQ the day of your offer to Elco. 
We shall have 15 days to tell you whether we, or anyone to whom we
have assigned the right to purchase, wish to buy the stock at the
offered price.  We will pay 10% of the price at the time we tell
you we wish to buy and the balance will be paid against delivery of
the stock within 30 days thereafter.  Any stock which you offer to
us and we do not purchase may be sold by you for the next 45 days
at the price you offer us or a higher price.  Other than as I have
described above, neither you nor your group will sell its Elco
stock.

If this expresses your understanding and is agreeable to you,
please sign and return to me the duplicate copy of this letter and
I will present it to the board at our next meeting presently
scheduled for August 17, at which time I will ask the board to
approve this agreement.  I will then promptly notify you.

Elco is a good company with capable and energetic employees.  We
are pleased that you agree.

Kindest regards,



Jack W. Packard
Chairman
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Mr. Packard,



I am pleased to return to you herewith your letter-agreement dated
June 27, 1989 regarding further purchases of Elco stock by Okabe
Co., Ltd.  I have signed the same, as President, and am returning
it to you herewith with our following understanding to your
letter-agreement.

In case Okabe's percentage of ownership of ELco shares increases to
more than 21~ due to decrease in the number of outstanding shares
caused by acquisition of its own shares by Elco, such change in
percentage of Okabe's ownership to more than 21% shall not be
construed to be in violation of paragraph 1 of your
letter-agreement.

We believe that your intention is identical to our above
understanding.


Yours very truly,



Akira Okabe

                   Management's Discussion and Analysis
             (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

                        Elco Industries, Inc.

Results of Operations
     
Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993
     For the year ended June 30, 1994, net sales were a record $225,901, an 
increase of 13.4% over the prior year's sales of $199,179.  Net income 
increased 69.0% to $8,229, or $1.65 per share, from $4,869, or $.98 per share.
   Sales in the Industrial Products Group were $169,078, a 16.4% increase
which represented approximately 90% of the total sales increase.  Sales to
the automotive market increased 19% on an 11% increase in automotive
production.  This resulted in sales per car and light truck produced 
increasing to $8.42 per vehicle versus $7.78 the prior year.  Sales to the
nonautomotive industrial markets increased 12%, with especially strong
growth to manufacturers of controls and instruments, hand tools and
compressors.  Sales in the Home and Construction Group increased 5.5%.
Sales growth in this segment was adversely impacted by the loss of two
significant customers.  However, new business gained at two home center
customers more than offset this loss.
   Gross profit margin increased to 18.9% from 18.3% in the prior year as
a result of higher capacity utilization and cost containment efforts.  Raw
material cost and wages measured as a percentage of sales remained
constant.  Benefit costs increased at a higher rate than sales because of
increases in medical costs and employee incentive programs.
   Selling and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than sales.
The majority of the increase was caused by higher benefits costs, higher
professional expenses primarily resulting from expenses associated with an
industrial bond refinancing, additional employees and higher wage rates.
Measured as a percentage of sales, selling and administrative expenses were
11.5%, the lowest level in over 10 years.
   Income from operations was $16,569, or 7.3% of sales, versus
$12,427, or 6.2% of sales, in the prior year.  This improvement was
primarily due to strong performance from the Industrial Products Group
where greater capacity utilization and a shift in sales to higher margin
products contributed to a 54% increase in operating income.  The Home and
Construction Products Group experienced a decrease in operating income
due to an expense of approximately $500 related to the loss of one of the
customers mentioned previously and to initial stocking and product
introduction costs associated with new business gained at two home center
customers.

                              Page 23
 
<PAGE>
   Interest expense was lower because of lower debt levels and the
refinancing of two industrial revenue bonds at lower interest rates.
   Elco's share of profits from Rocknel Fastener, Inc., a joint venture
company, was $189 versus a loss of $258 in the prior year.  Greater
capacity utilization and efficiencies contributed to this improvement.
   
Fiscal 1993 Compared to Fiscal 1992
     For the year ended June 30, 1993, net sales were $199,179, up
5.2% from the prior year's sales of $189,337.  Net income for the year was
$4,869, or $.98 per share, versus a loss of $2,525, or $(.52) per share.  The
prior fiscal year included a pretax, nonoperating charge of $5,091 to reduce
the value of a promissory note receivable and a onetime, noncash charge for
retiree health care costs of $1,355, net of a related deferred tax benefit of
$852.  These two charges reduced the prior year's net income by $4,485, or
$.94 per share.
   Sales in the Industrial Products Group increased 9.0%, or $12,049.
Approximately $9,000 of this increase resulted from sales to the automotive
industry.  Production of cars and light trucks increased 9.0%, while sales to
the automotive industry increased 10.3%, indicating a continuing increase in
market share.  Sales to domestic nonassembly automotive plants and
foreign-owned automotive suppliers represented approximately 90% of this
increase.  Sales to nonautomotive markets increased modestly because of
stronger economic activity.  Sales in the Home and Construction Products
Group decreased $2,207 as a result of warehouse inventory reduction
programs at certain major customers.
   Gross profit margin was 18.3% versus 17.1% in the prior year.  This
improvement resulted from higher sales, improved operating efficiencies
which lowered manufacturing costs and, to a lesser extent, the introduction
of new products.  These positive factors were partially offset by continuing
pricing pressures, primarily in the automotive market.  The prior year's gross
profit included costs associated with moving the Bear-Kat operations and
with reorganizing certain operating units in the Industrial Products Group.
   Selling and administrative expenses increased 3.6% on a 5.2% sales
increase.  The majority of the increase was caused by increases in wages and
benefit costs.  Measured as a percentage of sales, selling and administrative
expenses were 12.0% of sales.
   Income from operations was $12,427, or 6.2% of sales, versus $9,243,
or 4.9% of sales in the prior year.  This increase of 34.4% in operating
income resulted from the 

                              Page 24

<PAGE>
significant improvement in the Industrial Products
Group.  The prior year's operating income in this segment included the cost
of reorganizing certain divisions.  The benefits of this reorganization are 
being realized in improved operating efficiencies and better cost containment
programs.  Higher sales and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices
of new products also contributed to margin improvement.  Operating income
in the Home and Construction Products Group decreased primarily because
of lower sales.
   Interest expense was lower primarily because of benefits derived from an
interest rate swap agreement which effectively lowered interest rates on
approximately 60% of total debt.
   Elco's share of losses from Rocknel Fastener, Inc., a joint venture
company, was $258 versus $649 the prior year.  This reduction in losses
was a result of continual cost containment efforts, productivity
improvements and introduction of new products.
   
Outlook
     Management believes that sales and earnings will increase next year.
This belief is based upon projections of higher automobile production,
continuing growth in market penetration and further economic expansion.  It
is assumed that further rises in interest rates will not significantly affect
the economy, especially automotive sales.  Operating income should grow faster
than sales because of implementation of profit enhancing strategies.
   Sales growth in the Industrial Products Group is expected to result from
higher automotive production, introduction of new products, expansion in
the transplant market and generally higher demand from commercial
markets.  Operating income is expected to increase because of higher sales
and improved operating leverage.  Growth in sales and earnings might be
affected somewhat by capacity constraints.  Also, profit improvement will
not likely equal the improvement experienced in the year ended June 30,
1994.
   This segment will continue to be adversely impacted by pricing pressures,
especially in the automotive industry.  Recently, prices of various raw
materials have begun to increase.  Steel and plastic price increases could
have an impact on profit margins.
   Sales in the Home and Construction Products Group are expected to
increase primarily because of growth in the home center market.  For the
next two or three quarters, initial stocking and product introduction costs
associated with the new home center business will cause operating margins
to be below historical levels.  Management expects margins to improve
toward the end of the fiscal year.
   The Company is currently involved in matters of litigation arising from the
normal course of business, including certain environmental and product
liability matters.  For a further discussion of these issues, refer to Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements, Footnote 16, "Contingencies," on page
36.
   
Balance Sheet Discussion
     
   Total assets increased 3% to $151,465 on a 13% increase in net sales.
   Working capital at June 30, 1994 was $33,380, or approximately 15%
of sales, a level the Company considers normal.  Both accounts receivable
and inventories increased by approximately the same percentage as sales.
The increases in accounts receivables and inventories, caused by higher
sales, were partially offset by a decrease in cash and an increase in accrued
salaries, wages and commissions.
   Total property, plant and equipment at cost increased $9,614 reflecting
capital expenditures of $12,388 which were offset by $2,774 of retirements and
disposals.  Approximately 85% of capital expenditures were for the Industrial
Products Group.
   Total interest-bearing debt decreased $3,729 from $50,026 to $46,297
as a result of scheduled payments.  Scheduled payments are $4,437 for
fiscal year 1995.  The weighted average interest rate on the indebtedness
was 6.8% at June 30, 1994 versus 7.4% at June 30, 1993.  It is expected
that the weighted average interest rate will increase this year as rising
interest rates decrease the benefit from interest rate swaps.
   
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     
Fiscal 1994
     For fiscal 1994, operating activities generated $17,090 of cash flow,
a level lower than in 1993.  While net income, depreciation and amortization
generated additional cash, other noncash working capital, primarily
inventories, required significant cash to finance the increasing sales base.
   Investing activities consisted primarily of $12,388 of additions to
property, plant and equipment, an amount 25% greater than the level of
depreciation.  Machinery and equipment represented 73% of the total
expenditures.  During the past three years, capital expenditures were
$32,507, compared to $27,773 of depreciation.  Capital expenditures for
fiscal 1995 are expected to approximate $14,500.

                               Page 25

<PAGE>
   Financing activities consisted primarily of the refinancing of $7,000 of
industrial development revenue bonds to obtain lower interest rates and the
payment of $3,705 of required principal.  While the Company has $18,000
of bank lines of credit, no borrowings were required during the year.
Dividend payments of $.52 per share totaled $2,593.  In August 1994, the
Company increased the dividend to an annual rate of $.60 per share, a 15%
increase.  In June 1994, the Company purchased 135,000 shares of its
stock for $2,498 from a major stockholder.
   
Fiscal 1993
     For fiscal 1993, cash sources were primarily depreciation and
amortization of intangibles of $9,916 and net income of $4,869.  Also,
reduction in noncash working capital and construction funds held in trust
totalling $4,753 contributed to the positive cash flow.  The primary use of
cash was the capital expenditure program of $9,569 and, to a lesser extent,
repayment of debt and payment of dividends.
   During the year, cash reserves increased $5,451 and total indebtedness
decreased $3,565.  Since equity increased $3,036 and debt decreased,
financial leverage decreased producing a debt to total capital ratio of 45.0%.
   The Company had $18,000 of bank lines of credit to provide for any
unplanned cash requirements.  There were no requirements to use these lines
during the year.
   
New Accounting Pronouncements
     In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
adopted Statement No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," which will be effective for the year ended June 30, 1995, and will
require accrual accounting for the estimated cost of benefits provided to
former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
Management has begun evaluating those benefits that may require accrual
accounting and believes that it is not likely to have a material impact on the
Company.
   During December 1991, the FASB issued SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," which will require additional
disclosures regarding long-term debt and other financial instruments.  The
Company must adopt SFAS No. 107 no later than June 30, 1996.  Adoption
of this statement will not impact the carrying value of the Company's assets
and liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in thousands except per share amounts)

Elco Industries, Inc.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Elco 
Industries, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  The Company's
investment in its affiliate is accounted for under the equity method.
     Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is 
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) and first-in, first-out (FIFO)
methods.
     Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost.  Depreciation and
amortization is designed to amortize costs over the estimated service lives
or lease periods using the straight-line method.  Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense.
     Deferred taxes on income is recorded to reflect the tax consequences on
future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their financial amounts at each year-end.
     Intangibles, net consist of excess of cost over net assets of businesses
acquired of $6,870 and $7,103 and other intangible assets of $3,231 and
$4,098 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Intangibles are being 
amortized on a straight-line basis over useful lives ranging from 5-39 years, 
subject to impairment write-offs determined by underlying cash flow.  
Accumulated amortization was $4,690 and $3,591 at June 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
     The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements which involve the
exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the 
life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying principal 
amounts.  The difference to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates
change and is reflected currently as an adjustment to interest expense.
     Net income per common share has been computed using the average number 
of shares outstanding during each year.
     The Company capitalizes interest costs relating to construction of 
property, equipment and its investment in unconsolidated affiliate during the
affiliate's start-up period.  Interest capitalized was $132, $90 and $99 for 
the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all 
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.
     In November 1992, the FASB adopted Statement No. 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which will be effective for the year
ended June 30, 1995 and will require accrual accounting for the estimated 
cost of benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but
before retirement.  Management has begun evaluating those benefits that may
require accrual accounting and believes that it is not likely to have a 
material impact on the Company.
     
2. PRODUCTS AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
         The Company is a leading domestic manufacturer and supplier of 
specialty metal fasteners and custom-engineered metal and plastic components 
and products.  The Company's operations can be classified into two segments:
     
A.   Industrial Products-the manufacture and sale of custom-engineered and 
     specialty components sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers 
     in a variety of markets including the transportation, electrical and 
     electronics, fabricated metal and other industrial markets.
B.   Home and Construction Products-the packaging and merchandising of a full
     line of screws, nails,  consumer and hobby wire, picture hanging wire 
     and other standard fasteners and fastening-related products for consumer
     use.  Also, the design, manufacture and marketing of specialty product
     lines and fastening systems for the commercial construction market.

     Certain financial information by industry segment follows.  Since the 
Company does not maintain complete financial information by segment, the 
following information includes both items directly traceable to each segment 
as well as an allocation to segments (based on reasonable estimates) for items
not directly traceable to a given segment.  Intersegment sales are made 
primarily at cost plus a markup.

3. INVENTORIES
         Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is 
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for approximately 46% 
and 48% of the Company's inventories at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.  The
inventories  are summarized as follows:

4. INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE
        In June 1989, Elco and Nagoya Screw Manufacturing Co., Ltd. 
("Nagoya") formed a joint venture known as Rocknel Fastener, Inc. 
("Rocknel").  Each company has a 50% interest in the venture and provided 
the initial funding in August 1989.  The following represents condensed
financial information of Rocknel as of and for the periods ended June 30, 
1994, 1993 and 1992.

     Rocknel had $5,000 of unsecured lines of credit, which were 
fully utilized at June 30, 1994.  The lines require no compensating balances
or commitment fees.  Elco and Nagoya are each contingently liable as 
guarantors of 50% of amounts used under the line.
     
5. OTHER ASSETS
         Included in other assets is the remaining balance of notes 
receivable from Acme Rivet and Machine Corp. ("Acme") of $489 and $1,336 at 
June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The notes receivable from Acme, which 
are currently not accruing interest, are expected to be repaid from the 
proceeds of the sale of its land and buildings which were collateral 
associated with the notes.  During 1994, the notes increased $303 as a result
of a final loan guarantee payment advanced to Acme.  The notes were written 
down approximately $1,150 in 1994 as the value of collateral underlying the 
notes declined, primarily as a result of higher than anticipated 
environmental remediation costs.  Environmental cost estimates are based on 
information provided by environmental consultants involved in the cleanup 
efforts and reflect future cleanup costs.
     See Note 15, Non-Operating Expenses, for other transactions related to 
the Acme divestiture.
      
6. SHORT-TERM LINES OF CREDIT
         At June 30, 1994, the Company had unused bank lines of credit 
permitting borrowing up to an aggregate of $18,000 at the banks' corporate 
base rate or at a fixed rate (at the option of the Company) as defined in the
agreements.  The lines require no compensating balances or commitment fees.
The lines, generally reviewed annually for renewal, are subject to the usual 
terms and conditions applied by the banks.
     
7. LONG-TERM DEBT
         Long-term debt at June 30, 1994 and 1993 (exclusive of current 
maturities) consisted of the following:
     
                                                             June 30,
                                                      1994              1993
Notes payable to institutional investors:
  10.04% due serially 1996-2001                     $25,200           $27,600
  9.15% due serially 1996-1997                        3,000             5,000
Economic development revenue bonds                   13,500            13,500

                                                    $41,860           $46,290
                                                    =======           =======

                   Maturities of long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 1994,
in aggregate amounts, are as follows for years ended June 30: 1995, $4,430; 
1996, $4,560; 1997, $4,000; 1998, $4,100; and 1999, $6,900.
     At June 30, 1994, the Company had two interest rate swap agreements.  
One agreement matures on April 16, 1997 and has a notional amount of $27,600.
The notional amount incrementally decreases to $21,600 by October 16, 1996. 
The agreement, 
                            Page 31
    
<PAGE>
which effectively converts the fixed-rate debt into 
variable-rate debt, is indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate.  The counterparty
to this aggreement is a major financial institution.  The notional amount is 
used to measure the volume of this agreement and does not represent exposure 
to credit loss.  The market risk is that the LIBOR rate, which is reset every
six months, will exceed the fixed rate of 5.93%.  Payments due to or from the
counterparty are payable at the end of each six-month period.
     The other agreement matures on November 2, 1996 and has a notional 
amount of $7,000.  The agreement, which effectively converts the fixed-rate 
debt into variable-rate debt, is indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate.  The
counterparty to this agreement is a major financial institution.  The
notional amount is used to measure the volume of this agreement and does not 
represent exposure to credit loss.  The market risk is that the LIBOR rate, 
which is reset every six months, will exceed the fixed rate of 4.28%.  
Payments due to or from the counterparty are payable at the end of each 
six-month period.
     Economic development revenue bonds include four issues by two 
municipalities.  Two issues have interest rates varying with maturity and 
average 5.2%.  Those bonds, initially issued in 1988, were refunded in October
1993.  The other two issues have variable interest rates which were 2.7% and
3.2% at June 30, 1994.  The bonds are collateralized by either certain 
property and equipment with a book value of approximately $4,398 at June 30, 
1994 or collateralized by a letter of credit.
     Interest expense on long-term debt, net of the interest rate swap 
benefit, was recorded at a weighted-average rate of approximately 6.8% and 
7.4% at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The Company must meet certain debt covenants.  Under the most 
restrictive covenant, $2,657 of retained earnings at June 30, 1994 is not 
restricted as to payments of dividends.  The agreements include a change in 
control provision which may result in a prepayment penalty and all unpaid
principal and interest due immediately.
     During December 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," which 
will require additional disclosures regarding long-term debt and other 
financial instruments.  The Company must adopt SFAS No. 107 no later than 
June 30, 1996.  Adoption of this statement will not impact the carrying value
of the Company's assets and liabilities.
     
8. RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE
         The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension plans covering substantially all employees.  The Company
also has an unfunded retirement plan for certain key employees which is being
provided for by charges to earnings sufficient to meet the benefit obligation.
     Charges to consolidated income for retirement plans were as follows:

     The employer contribution to one profit sharing plan is the sum of 10% 
of profits (as defined in the plan) and an additional discretionary amount 
that the directors may designate.  For the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 
and 1992, there was no additional discretionary amount.  The employer 
contribution to another profit sharing plan is discretionary as determined by
the directors.
     The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) covering 
substantially all employees.  Contributions may be made in cash, newly-issued
stock or treasury stock.  Cash contributions may be used to purchase shares 
from the Company or on the open market, depending on the Company's financing 
needs and the market price of its common shares.
     The fiscal 1994 contributions were made using 50% cash and 50% stock. 
The fiscal 1993 contributions were made using 53% cash and 47% stock.  The 
fiscal 1992 contributions were made in stock.
     In addition to providing pension and other supplemental benefits, 
certain health care benefits are provided for eligible retired employees. 
Employees become eligible for these benefits if they meet minimum age and 
service requirements, are eligible for retirement benefits and contribute a
portion of the cost.
     During 1992, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits 
Other Than Pensions" were adopted.  The Statement requires companies to 
accrue the expected cost of providing postretirement benefits other than 
pensions over the years that employees render the necessary service rather 
than the cash basis previously used.  The projected benefit obligation of 
$1,355 (net of tax of $852) relating to prior service cost was a non-cash 
transaction recognized as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of
July 1, 1991.  The total cumulative effect of this accounting change was to 
decrease net earnings by $.28 per share.
     The accounting for the unfunded health care plan incorporates the 
pattern of cost-sharing of changes to the existing plan.  The plan benefits 
are discretionary and are subject to modification or termination.
     The following table sets forth the plan's obligation.

     The discount rates used in determining the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation were 8.0% and 8.5% for fiscal years 1994 and 1993, 
respectively.  The actuarial calculations for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 
assume an increase in the health care cost trend rate of 10%, 11% and 11%,
respectively.  The assumed rate decreases gradually to 6% in 2051 and remains
constant beyond that point.  A 1% increase in the health care trend rate 
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $137 at 
year end 1994 and the net periodic cost by $10 for the year.

     Certain leases require payments by the Company, as lessee, for

10. PERFORMANCE AWARD PLAN
         The Company has a long-term incentive plan under which key employees
may be granted a monetary target award.  The awards are earned only to the 
extent that the Company achieves predetermined performance goals during a 
three-year performance period.  Payment for awards earned is payable in cash 
or shares of common stock, or a combination thereof, at the sole discretion of
the Board of Directors.
     A maximum of 14,189 awards were earned in 1994 and were paid in 
August 1994 by the issuance of 4,062 shares of common stock with the balance 
paid in cash, such allocation determined by the Board of Directors.
     There were no performance share awards earned in 1993 and 1992.
     At June 30, 1994, a maximum of 235,443 shares remained available for 
issuance under the 1988 Performance Share Plan. 
     The Company recognizes compensation costs attributable to the plan on a 
basis that spreads estimates of such costs over the performance period.  Such
costs totaled $382, $150 and $85 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     
11. STOCK OPTIONS

shares of the Company's common stock are reserved for issuance upon the 
exercise of options granted.  Options are not exercisable until five years 
after date of grant.

     In October 1992, the Company adopted the 1992 Stock Option Plan for 
Non-Employee Directors.  Under the plan, 50,000 shares of the Company's

12. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PLAN
         The Company has a plan that requires the payment of the annual 
retainer for non-employee directors under 60 years of age in common stock of 
the Company rather than in cash.  This plan also allows non-employee 
directors over 60 years of age the option of receiving the annual retainer in
common stock rather than cash.  The directors' rights to the shares vest over
five-year periods at the rate of 20% per year.  However, each director is 
entitled to receive dividends and exercise voting rights with respect to all 
shares prior to vesting.  Any unvested shares are forfeited if the director
ceases to be a director for any reason other than death or disability.
     
13. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
         During 1988, the Company adopted and amended a Stockholder Rights 
Plan and issued common stock purchase rights at the rate of one right for 
each outstanding share of common stock.
     Each right will entitle stockholders, other than those held by person or
group that has acquired more than 20% of the Company's voting stock without 
board approval, to buy one newly-issued share of common stock of the Company 
at an exercise price of $40 or, in the alternative, allows the board (by vote
of disinterested directors) to exchange rights for shares of common stock.  
The rights may be exercised or exchanged only if a person or group, without 
Elco board approval, acquires beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the 
Company's voting stock.  The Company will generally be entitled to redeem the
rights at $.025 per right at any time until 15 days following a public
announcement that a greater than 20% position has been acquired.
     If the Company is involved in a merger or other business combination 
transaction, without board approval, with any other person or group in which 
the Company's common stock is changed or converted, or sells 50% or more of 
the Company's 
                             Page 34

<PAGE>      
assets or earning power to any other person or group, each 
right entitles its holder to purchase, at the right's exercise price, shares
of common stock of such other person having a value of twice the right's then
current exercise price.
     In addition, if without Elco board approval, any person or group becomes
the beneficial owner of more than 20% of the Company's voting stock, then 
each right not owned by such other person or related parties entitles its 
holder to purchase, at the right's then current exercise price, shares of
common stock of Elco with a market value of twice the right's then current 
exercise price.
     In August 1989, the Company's Board of Directors approved an agreement 
with Okabe Company Limited permitting Okabe to increase its ownership to not 
more than 21% of the Company's outstanding shares provided that, for a period
of 10 years, Okabe will limit its ownership to no more than 21%.  Because the
Company's board approved this increase, Okabe's cumulative purchases of
amounts of not more than 21% will not trigger the Company's Stockholder 
Rights Plan.
     On June 15, 1994, the Company purchased 135,000 shares of its common 
stock for $2,498 from Okabe Company Limited.  The purchase was pursuant 
to the terms of a share purchase agreement dated as of June 7, 1994, which, 
in addition to such purchase, provided that if requested by Okabe, the 
Company would file a registration statement for an underwritten public 
offering of Okabe's remaining shares no later than September 1, 1994 (or as 
soon thereafter as practicable), Okabe will not solicit offers to buy its 
remaining shares of the Company in private transactions until the earlier of
November 15, 1994 or five business days following the effective date of such 
registration statement, and Okabe is permitted to sell up to 25,000 of its 
remaining shares of the Company per month on NASDAQ without first offering 
such shares to the Company as required by a letter agreement dated 
June 27, 1989 between the Company and Okabe.  Okabe did not request of the 
Company by September 1, 1994 that a registration statement be filed.
     No other stockholder beneficially owns, to the knowledge of the Company,
more than 5% of the Company's Common Stock.

     Included in the cumulative effect of changes in accounting is $852 of 
deferred income taxes for 1992.  The income tax for the 1992 accounting 
change has been provided at a rate higher than the Federal statutory rate to 
provide for State income taxes.
     Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109").  
The primary effect of adoption on the Company is that the balance sheet 
classification of deferred taxes now corresponds to the related assets or
liability.  Under the previous method, the balance sheet classification of 
deferred taxes was based on when the temporary differences between financial 
reporting and tax reporting were expected to reverse.  The effect of the 
change on net income was immaterial to the Company.  Accordingly, no 
cumulative adjustment for the adoption of SFAS 109 was required.
     The components of the Company's net deferred tax liability as of 
June 30, 1994 were as follows:

         For 1993 and 1992, the provision (credit) for taxes payable in 
future years, arising from the temporary differences between the financial 
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, at the tax rates in effect
when these differences are expected to reverse, are as follows:

15. NONOPERATING EXPENSES
         The Company divested Acme Rivet and Machine Corp. ("Acme") in 
June 1986 and as partial payment received promissory notes.  During 1992, the
Company incurred non-operating expenses of $5,091 to reflect the reduced 
value of notes and related collateral for the promissory notes received.

16. CONTINGENCIES
         The Company is currently involved in matters of litigation arising 
from the normal course of business, including certain environmental and 
product liability matters.  At June 30, 1994, the Company had accruals of 
approximately $1,100 (approximately $900 at June 30, 1993) with respect to
such matters based on the Company's current estimate of the most likely 
amount of losses that it believes will be incurred.  These  amounts, which 
are expected to be paid over the next several years, have been included in 
current and other deferred liabilities. The most significant portion of this
accrual relates to the following two paragraphs.
     
         The Company, together with other parties, has been designated a 
"potentially responsible party" (PRP) by the United States Environmental 
Protection  Agency (USEPA) with respect to the cost of investigation and 
cleanup of a third-party site in Illinois.  Certain removal and other interim
remediations have been completed and paid for by the PRPs.  The Company's 
current accrual for this matter is based on the percentage of costs incurred
to date that have been allocated to the Company and its estimate of the most 
likely future investigation and cleanup costs.  At June 30, 1994, the Company 
has separately recorded a receivable related to this matter of approximately 
$300 for the amount it believes is probable of recovery under insurance
contracts.

     The Company is also a third-party defendant in a federal enforcement 
action brought by the USEPA against several other primary defendants.  The 
Company's accrual for this matter is based on a settlement offer proposed 
in July 1994.
     
     It is the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, that 
additional liabilities, if any, resulting from litigation matters are not 
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the 
Company, although such matters could have a material effect on quarterly or
annual operating results when (or if) resolved in a future period.
     In January 1994, the USEPA notified the Company that it is one of over 
300 PRPs with respect to the old Southington Landfill Superfund Site in 
Southington, Connecticut.  Elco was identified as a successor to a company 
that allegedly used the site.  The USEPA has not yet selected a plan of
remediation for the site.  The Company has insufficient information to 
determine its potential exposure in connection with the site, when (or if) it
will incur such costs and the ultimate impact of the costs upon the Company's
financial condition and results of operations.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Directors
Elco Industries, Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elco 
Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the 
related statements of consolidated income, stockholders' equity and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Elco 
Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the 
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

   As discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, the Company changed 
its method of accounting for postretirement benefits in 1992.
