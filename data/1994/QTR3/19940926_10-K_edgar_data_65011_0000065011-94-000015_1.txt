Item 1.  Business


1 (a).  General Development of Business

Meredith Corporation (the Company) was founded in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1902 as
an Iowa corporation by Edwin Thomas Meredith, as the publisher of Successful
Farming magazine.  Since 1922--when Meredith introduced its second publication,
the predecessor of Better Homes and Gardens magazine--the Company has continued
to expand its operations in media and related products and services through
internal growth and acquisitions.

Today, Meredith Corporation publishes magazines and books, owns and operates
broadcast television stations and operates a residential real estate marketing
and franchising service.  The Company is also engaged in direct sales of
selected consumer products and services, and is involved in publishing, broad-
cast and cable television activities through subsidiaries and joint ventures.

In December 1993, the Company sold two of its broadcast television properties
to Granite Broadcasting Corporation.  The Company sold the assets of WTVH, a
CBS affiliate licensed to serve Syracuse, New York, and the stock of a Company
subsidiary that owned KSEE, an NBC affiliate licensed to serve Fresno,
California.

In January 1994, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., introduced Better Homes and Gardens
Garden Centers in more than 2,000 stores nationwide.  Royalties are paid to the
Company upon the sale of licensed products in the Wal-Mart/Better Homes and
Gardens Garden Centers.

In June 1994, the Company acquired a minority share in a multimedia publisher,
Multicom Publishing, Inc.  Multicom is a leading developer and publisher of
home/family/lifestyle CD-ROM titles, including several based on the Company's
home and family editorial products.

In June 1994, the Company announced that KPHO, previously an independent
station in Phoenix, will become affiliated with CBS in the fall of 1994 and
WNEM, an NBC affiliate serving the Flint/Saginaw/Bay City, Michigan market,
will affiliate with CBS in fiscal 1995.  The Company's other television
stations are KCTV, a CBS affiliate in Kansas City, and two Fox affiliates: 
KVVU in Las Vegas and WOFL in Orlando.

In August 1994, Meredith Corporation reached an agreement to acquire the assets
of WSMV-TV, an NBC network affiliate in Nashville, Tennessee.  This transaction
is expected to close in January 1995, subject to regulatory approvals.

including the Better Homes and Gardens trademark and Meredith Press. The books
are sold through retail outlets, direct mail, book clubs and other means.  Each
year, new titles or revised editions are published, and some titles are
discontinued.  Approximately 70 new or revised titles were published during
fiscal 1994.  The Company also markets other publishers' books and related non-
book products through its book club operations, including Better Homes and
Gardens Crafts Club, Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book Club, Country Homes and
Gardens Book Club, Home Craftsman Book Club and Outdoor Life Book Club.  

Books offered through retail outlets, direct mail and book clubs are primarily
sold on a fully returnable basis.

The Company has licensed Multicom Publishing, Inc., in which it has a minority
interest, to develop and publish several CD-ROM titles based on Meredith's home
and family editorial products.  The Company earns royalties on the sales of
these titles.

The Company has licensed Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to operate Better Homes and
Gardens Garden Centers in more than 2,000 stores nationwide.  Royalties are
paid to the Company for licensed products sold exclusively in the Wal-Mart/
Better Homes and Gardens Garden Centers.

Trademarks (for example, Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal),
licenses and franchises are highly important to this segment and are often
utilized in introducing new products.

Publishing revenues are subject to some seasonal fluctuations with spring and
fall generally being higher volume periods than summer and winter.

The major raw materials essential to this segment are coated and uncoated
publication paper and book-grade papers.  In recent years the paper market has
been soft, with sufficient supplies available and prices stable or falling. 
Late in fiscal 1994, the paper market began to tighten due to increasing demand
resulting from a stronger economy.  While the Company expects to be able to
obtain sufficient supplies of paper to meet its publishing requirements through
its current paper contracts, price increases are expected in fiscal 1995.  If
coated paper should become in short supply, the Company expects to use more
uncoated paper or purchase available coated paper in foreign markets.  Postage
is also a significant expense to this segment due to promotion, magazine
subscription and book mailings.  A postal increase has been proposed by the
Postal Service in 1995.

The Company has printing contracts for all its magazine titles.  Its two
largest titles, Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal, are printed
under contracts with R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company.  All of the Company's
published books are manufactured by outside printers with the Company usually
supplying the paper.  Book manufacturing contracts are generally on title by
title bases.

Publishing is a highly competitive business.  The Company's magazines, books,
and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media and
many other types of leisure-time activities.  Overall competitive factors in
this segment include price, editorial quality and customer service. 
Competition for advertising dollars in the Magazine Group is primarily based on
advertising rates, reader response to advertisers' products and services and
effectiveness of the sales teams.  Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home
Journal compete for readers and advertising dollars primarily in the women's


                                    - 8 -

service magazine category.  Both are members of a group known as the "Seven
Sisters," which also includes Family Circle, Good Housekeeping, McCall's,
Redbook and Woman's Day magazines published by other companies.

  (1) VHF (very high frequency) stations transmit on channels 2 through 13;
      UHF (ultra high frequency) stations transmit on channels above 13.  
      Technical factors and area topography determine the market served by a 
      television station.

  (2) Designated Market Area ("DMA"), as defined by A. C. Nielsen Company
      ("Nielsen"), is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties
      in which local stations receive a preponderance of total viewing hours.
      DMA data is a significant factor in determining television advertising

      rates.  The market rank is the Nielsen DMA rank based on estimated
      television households as reported in Investing in Television,
      1994 Market Report dated May 1994 ("May 1994 Nielsen Report").

  (3) The number of television broadcast stations is from the May 1994 Nielsen
      Report.  Public television stations are not included.

  (4) In June 1994, the Company announced that KPHO, it's independent tele-
      vision station in Phoenix and WNEM, it's NBC affiliate in Flint/Saginaw/
      Bay City would join the CBS television network.  In September 1994 KPHO
      became a CBS affiliate.  WNEM will become a CBS affiliate during fiscal
      year 1995.

Two other television properties, KSEE (Fresno, California) and WTVH (Syracuse,
New York), were sold in December 1993.

On August 19, 1994, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to
acquire the assets of WSMV-TV, an NBC affiliate in Nashville, Tennessee, the
country's 33rd largest market.  This acquisition is expected to close in
January 1995, pending regulatory approval.

Advertising is the principal source of revenue for the Broadcast Group.  The
stations sell commercial time to both local and national advertisers.  Rates
for national and local spot advertising are influenced by the market size and
demographics, demand for advertising time and the ability of the station to
attract the audiences reflected in rating surveys.  The rates for local and
national advertising are determined by each station.  Most national advertising
is sold through a national advertising representative firm.  Each station's own
sales force sells its local advertising time.  Revenues from the sale of
broadcast commercial time fluctuate somewhat on a seasonal basis with spring
and fall generally being the periods of highest volume.

Network affiliates receive programming and cash compensation from national
networks.  In exchange for the programming, affiliates give up most of the
advertising time in these programs to the networks.  Programming expense for
the Company's Broadcast Group has declined in the past few years largely due to
increased use of first-run programming.  The CBS affiliation of KPHO in Phoenix
(versus formerly being independent) will further reduce the need for purchased
programming.

Television broadcasting operations are subject to regulation by the Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") under the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended ("Communications Act").  Under the Communications Act, the FCC
primarily assigns frequency bands; determines stations' frequencies, locations
and power; regulates station licenses and equipment; and determines regulations
and policies which affect the ownership, operation, and employment practices of 

                                   - 10 -

<PAGE>

broadcast stations.  Television licenses are granted for maximum periods of
five years and are renewable upon proper application for additional terms of up
to five years.  The Company is aware of no reason why its television station
licenses would not be renewed.  FCC rules are subject to change and the FCC may
in the future adopt regulations that could affect operations and profitability
of the Company's Broadcast Group.  The Company cannot predict any change which
could be adopted or determine, in advance, what impact any change could have on
its television stations.

The television broadcast business is highly competitive.  Meredith television
stations compete for advertising dollars with other television stations, cable
television and other mass media in their respective markets.  The stations also
compete with other stations in the market for desirable programming for off-
network hours.  Competitive position in each of the Company's broadcast markets
is largely affected by viewer acceptance of its programming.  (As all of the
Company's television stations are now affiliated with national networks,
acceptance and ratings of national programming has increased in importance.) 
However, local news and involvement in the local community continue to be
important in determining the success of each television station.


Real Estate

The Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Service is a national residential real
estate marketing service which licenses selected real estate firms to exclusive
territories.  Members and affiliates (real estate companies affiliated with
larger member firms) totaled 698 in the United States and 10 in Canada on June
30, 1994.  The primary sources of income for the Real Estate Service are
franchise fees (based on a percentage of each member's gross commission income
on residential housing sales) and the sale of marketing programs and materials
to member firms.

Until September 1991 the Real Estate Service also engaged in the relocation of
corporate employees through Better Homes and Gardens Family Relocation Service. 
The Company sold the net assets of its relocation operation to PHH Homequity
Corporation in September 1991.

The Better Homes and Gardens trademark and service mark are very important to
the Company's real estate operation.  Consumer real estate activity is usually
highest during the spring and summer months.  The real estate business is
highly competitive and customer service remains vital to the success of this
segment.  The Real Estate Service competes for members with other national real
estate franchise networks primarily on the bases of benefits provided to the
member and fees for membership.

Cable

The Company has a 70 percent indirect ownership in Meredith/New Heritage
Strategic Partners, L.P. ("Strategic Partners") through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Meredith Cable, Inc.  Strategic Partners owns and operates two
cable television systems:  a 23,000-subscriber system in Bismarck/Mandan, North
Dakota; and a 110,000-subscriber system in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota,
area.  The principal source of revenues for the cable operations is monthly
fees charged to subscribers for basic, tier and pay cable services.  Income is
also received from advertising, pay-per-view and other subscriber services.

Nonexclusive franchises granted by local authorities are essential to the
operation of this segment.  Franchise fees (generally five percent of operating
revenues) are paid to the local authorities.  The franchise agreements
typically specify the type of cable system that must be constructed and cover
such matters as total channel capacity and access.  Failure to comply with
local requirements may entitle the local authority to terminate the franchise. 
Franchise agreements for Strategic Partners' systems extend from 1997 through
2013.  Cable management believes that its operations are in compliance with the
terms of the franchise agreements in each of the municipalities in which it
offers cable television services.

Operations of cable television systems are also subject to federal regulation.  
The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 ("1984 Act") established certain
uniform national regulatory guidelines and gave the federal government
exclusive jurisdiction over cable television.  The 1984 Act also established
procedures and standards to protect a cable operator in the renewal of a cable
franchise; limited the amount of franchise fees paid to local franchising
authorities; granted authority to franchising authorities to establish
requirements in new franchises for the designation and use of certain access
channels; and codified certain of the FCC's current ownership regulations.

The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ("1992
Act") was enacted by Congress in October 1992.  This Act amended the 1984 Act
primarily to provide increased consumer protection and to promote increased
competition in the cable television market.  On April 1, 1993, the FCC adopted
comprehensive new federal standards for local regulation of cable rates in
accordance with the 1992 Act.  Effective on September 1, 1993, the new rules
were designed to ensure that rates charged by a cable operator not subject to
effective competition were comparable to rates that would be charged if the
cable operator was subject to effective competition.  These rate regulations
required cable systems operating above a benchmark average to reduce rates from
their September 30, 1992 level by approximately ten percent.  On May 15, 1994,
additional rate regulations were enacted.  Under these rules, regulated cable
systems were required to reduce rates by an additional seven percent from their


                                    - 12 -

<PAGE>

September 1992 levels, but not below the applicable benchmark.  These rate
regulations have had a negative impact on the revenues and operating results of
Strategic Partners' cable television systems.

The 1992 Act also required cable systems, effective June 1993, to carry the
signals of local  television stations, subject to limited exceptions.  In
addition, if a commercial television station does not assert a right to
mandatory carriage on a cable system, the station's signal may not be carried
by the cable system without express retransmission consent from the
broadcaster.

Various challenges to certain provisions of the 1992 Act have been filed with
various courts.  Of primary interest to the Company are the challenges to the
rate regulations.  The Company cannot predict the outcome of these court cases
nor what impact any ruling could have on the cable operations of Strategic
Partners.

In addition to those noted, there are numerous other federal and local
regulations which pertain to the ownership and operations of cable television
systems.

The cable television systems compete with other media for viewers and
advertising dollars in their respective markets on bases of price, programming
quality and customer service.  Changing technology may be expected to produce
or encourage additional competing systems for the delivery of entertainment and
information programming, including satellite dishes, direct broadcast
satellites and wireless cable systems.  There is also the potential for
significant competition from telephone companies in all aspects of cable
television services.

In light of the cable industry changes discussed above, the Company is
considering its options in relation to its continued investment in cable
television systems.  Strategic Partners has listed its cable television systems
for sale.  While management of the Company believes this is the most likely
outcome, other alternatives are also being considered.


General

The Company did not have any material expenses for research and development
during any of the past three fiscal years.

There is no material effect on capital expenditures, earnings and the
competitive position of the Company regarding compliance with federal, state
and local provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the
environment and to the protection of the environment.

                                    - 13 -

As of June 30, 1994, the Company employed 2,194 persons (including 299 in cable
operations).

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

The Company received federal income tax deficiency notices relative to its 1986
through 1990 tax years.  Generally, the claimed deficiencies related to the
amortization of intangibles and other matters connected with the acquisition of
Ladies' Home Journal magazine.  The Company contested these deficiencies in the
United States Tax Court.  On March 14, 1994, Meredith Corporation received a
favorable decision from the Tax Court.

The dominant issue, determined in favor of the Company, involved the tax basis
and ability to amortize the Ladies' Home Journal subscriber relationships.  The
Tax Court applied the 1993 decision of the United States Supreme Court in
Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States to the facts of the Company's case. 
The appeal period, with respect to the Tax Court's opinion, expired on
September 16, 1994 and the Company has no remaining exposure to the $12 million
potential tax cost previously reported.  Approximately $12 million (post-tax
benefit, including interest), will be received by the Company as a result of

Meredith Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

a. Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meredith
Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company).  All significant 
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The Company's investments in
companies 20 to 50 percent owned are accounted for under the equity method. In
fiscal 1993, the Company acquired an indirect ownership interest of 70 percent
in a Minnesota cable television system.  The financial statements of that cable
television system are consolidated with the Company's financial statements for
fiscal 1994 and 1993.

b. Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, all cash and short-term investments with
original maturities of three months or less are considered cash and cash
equivalents, since they are readily convertible to cash.

c. Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are carried at net amortized cost.  These securities
consisted of municipal bonds, commercial paper and other short-term investments
with market values of $12,169,000 at June 30, 1994, and $21,431,000 at June 30,
1993.

d. Inventories

Inventories of paper are stated at cost, determined using the last-in, first-
out (LIFO) method, which is not in excess of market.  All other inventories are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or market.

e. Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation expense is provided primarily on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.  Expenditures for maintenance, repairs
and minor replacements are charged to operations, and expenditures for major
replacements and betterments (including labor and construction costs) are added
to the property, plant and equipment accounts.  The cost and accumulated
depreciation of property, plant and equipment retired or sold are eliminated
from the property accounts at the time of retirement or sale and the resulting
gain or loss is recorded in income. 


                                     F-9
<PAGE>

f. Unearned Subscription Revenues and Subscription Acquisition Costs

Unearned subscription revenues and subscription acquisition costs are recorded
and recognized pro rata as delivery of magazines is made, beginning with the
month of initial delivery.  The balance sheet classifications of both unearned
subscription revenues and subscription acquisition costs are determined based
on the delivery month of the subscription.  

g. Film Rental Costs

Film rental costs reflect the value of all programming available for showing
and are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.  Film
rental costs are charged to operations on an accelerated amortization basis
over the contract period.  The cost of broadcast film rental estimated to be
charged to operations during the next fiscal year is classified as a current
asset. 

h. Income Taxes

On July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  Under the asset and
liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are required to be measured using the tax rate expected to be in
effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  Thus, in fiscal 1994,
income tax expense reflected the effect of the change in tax rates on deferred
tax assets and liabilities.  The Company previously used the asset and
liability method under SFAS No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  The effect
of the adoption of SFAS No. 109 was not material to the financial statements.

i. Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill and other intangibles occurred in the acquisition of certain
businesses.  In the opinion of management, there has been no material decline
to date in the value of such intangibles and recorded goodwill does not exceed
the undiscounted future cash flows of the underlying investment.  In accordance
with Opinion 17 of the Accounting Principles Board, intangibles arising in
connection with acquisitions after October 31, 1970, are being amortized by the
straight-line method over a period not exceeding 40 years.  Non-competition
agreements and programming rights purchased in conjunction with the Minnesota
cable acquisition are being amortized using the straight-line method over
periods of five years and eight years, respectively.  Amortization of
programming rights is included in production, distribution and editorial costs.


                                     F-10

j. Revenues 

Advertising revenues are recognized when ads are published or aired.  In
accordance with industry practice, certain products are sold to customers with
the right to return unsold items.  Revenues from such sales represent gross
sales less a provision for future returns.  Sales of books and certain other
products that are sold with a right of return are recorded less a provision for
returns at the time of shipment.

k. Computation of Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Earnings (loss) per share of common stock has been computed by dividing the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and class B stock outstanding
during each year into applicable earnings or loss.  The dilutive effect of
stock options issued was immaterial. 

l. Other 

In May 1993, SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," was issued.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 115 (on a
prospective basis) on July 1, 1994, as required.  It is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company's fiscal 1995 financial statements.

In December 1993, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP)
No. 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs."  Management believes that the
Company's current accounting policies are materially in compliance with the
requirements of SOP No. 93-7.

Certain prior-year financial information has been restated to conform to the
fiscal 1994 financial statement presentation.



2.Disclosures About the Fair Value of Financial Instruments

a. Marketable Securities

The fair value of marketable securities, consisting primarily of municipal
bonds, was approximately $12,200,000 at June 30, 1994 ($21,400,000 at June 30,
1993).  The fair value of marketable securities was determined based on quoted
market prices, where available, or through a bond pricing matrix, using
securities with similar yields and maturities. 



                                     F-11
<PAGE>


b. Film Rental Contracts Payable

The amount reflected as film rental contracts payable represents future
payments to be made under film program contract agreements.  The fair value of
film rights payable is the present value of future payments which was
approximately $10,300,000 at June 30, 1994 ($15,200,000 at June 30, 1993).  In
addition, film rental contracts payable that do not appear on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets due to their unavailability (see Note 12), had fair values of
$17,500,000 and $18,500,000 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

c. Long-Term Indebtedness

The fair value of long-term debt incurred by Meredith/New Heritage Strategic
Partners, L.P., ("Strategic Partners") was determined by discounting cash flows
through maturity using rates currently available to the partnership for
borrowing and swap agreements with similar terms and maturities.  That value
was approximately $140,000,000 at June 30, 1994 ($141,000,000 at June 30,
1993).

d. Other

The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30,
1994 and 1993, for all other assets and liabilities (and all other liabilities
not appearing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets per Note 12) subject to SFAS
No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," approximate
their respective fair values.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific
point in time based on relevant market and financial instrument information. 
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. 
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.



3. Inventories

Major components of inventories follow.   Of total inventory values shown,
approximate portions determined using the LIFO method were:  1994 - 32 percent,
1993 - 42 percent, 1992 - 29 percent, 1991 - 19 percent.  The decline in
finished goods and raw materials in 1992 from 1991 is primarily related to the
downsizing and repositioning of the Book Group's direct mail operations.  Due
to the sale of the Real Estate relocation operation in fiscal 1992, there was
no house inventory at June 30, 1992 or later years.

5. Long-Term Indebtedness and Restricted Assets

Long-term debt was incurred by Strategic Partners in connection with the
purchase of North Central Cable Communications Corporation on September 1,
1992.  As of June 30, 1994, $138 million was owed under the loan agreement
Strategic Partners has with 10 banks.  This debt is non-recourse to Meredith
Corporation.  This loan converted to a term loan on June 30, 1994, and is
payable in quarterly installments, beginning on September 30, 1994, in
percentages ranging from 1.9 to 5.5 percent of the borrowings outstanding at
June 30, 1994, with the final payment due March 31, 2001.  The borrowings are
secured by an interest in the assets of Strategic Partners.  The total assets
subject to lien were approximately $275 million at June 30, 1994.  Interest is
payable at rates based on prime, Eurodollar or certificate of deposit rates. 
At June 30, 1994, borrowings of approximately $48 million bear interest at
rates ranging from 5.81 to 6.56 percent under interest rate agreements expiring
between July and December 1994.  The remaining debt of $90 million bears
interest at rates of 8.55 percent for $80 million and 8.68 percent for $10
million under interest rate swap agreements expiring in September 1995.  The
weighted average rate of interest on the total debt outstanding at June 30,
1994, was 7.78 percent.  The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at
June 30, 1994, are as follows:

This loan agreement has provisions that restrict additional debt and
investments and requires Strategic Partners to meet certain operating and
financial tests.  Strategic Partners is prohibited by this loan agreement from
making dividend payments or any distributions to the partners except for
specified payments under certain conditions that would not cause a default
under the loan agreement.  The restricted net assets of Strategic Partners
included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 1994 were
approximately $91 million.  The cash balance reflected in that amount was
approximately $6 million.

The operating cash flows of Strategic Partners may not provide sufficient funds
to allow them to meet the payment terms of the loan agreements without the sale
of part or all of its cable television systems or an amendment to the loan
agreement amortization schedule.  (Strategic Partners is currently exploring
the disposition of its cable television systems.)  Under the terms of the loan
agreement, the proceeds from any sale of cable television assets must be
applied to reduce outstanding borrowings.  The first payment is due September
30, 1994.  Although a formal request has not been made, the lenders have
indicated they would support a request to extend the amortization period or to
postpone future scheduled payments in light of Strategic Partners' efforts to
sell its assets in part or in whole.  Strategic Partners' management intends
and believes it will be able to execute an amendment to the loan agreement to
modify the amortization schedule.

At June 30, 1994, Meredith Corporation had three unused committed lines of
credit totaling $23 million.  Termination dates for these lines of credit are
June 30, 1998, for $20 million and December 31, 1994, for $3 million. 
Commitment fees paid in fiscal 1994 were not material.


6. Common Stock, Stock Awards and Stock Options

Under the Company's Savings and Investment Plan [401(k)], 36,899 common shares
were issued during the year at market prices totaling $1,436,000 (50,667 shares
totaling $1,343,000 in 1993 and 62,828 shares totaling $1,642,000 in 1992).  A
total of 4,260,000 shares has been reserved for the Plan, of which 3,935,644
were issued at June 30, 1994.

The Company has two plans under which eligible employees may receive restricted
stock awards.  It also has a restricted stock plan for non-employee directors. 
These plans have various restriction periods tied to employment or service.
Common shares awarded and annual expense under these plans are as follows:

Years Ended June 30                             1994        1993        1992

Annual expense...........................  $1,228,000    $969,000  $1,439,000


Non-qualified stock options for shares of the Company's common stock are also
granted to eligible employees under a Company plan adopted in fiscal 1993. 
These options are subject to exercise vesting restrictions that lapse for one-
third of each award granted on each of the following three annual anniversary
dates.  Exercise rights expire 10 years after options are issued.  The Company
also has a non-qualified stock option plan for non-employee directors, adopted


                                     F-15

in fiscal 1994.  Each director is granted options for 1,000 shares of common
stock annually.  These options vest 40, 30 and 30 percent in each successive
year.  No options can be issued under this plan after July 31, 2003, and
exercise rights expire after the end of each director's service.  As of June
30, 1994:

(a) Net of 6,600 options forfeited.
(b) 2,500 shares were exercised in fiscal 1994 at market prices ranging from    
    $34.13 to $41.75.

The maximum number of shares reserved for use in all Company restricted stock
and stock incentive plans totals 1,775,000.  The total number of restricted
stock shares and stock options awarded under these plans at June 30, 1994, was
876,815. 

Class B stock, which has 10 votes per share, is not transferable as Class B
stock except to family members of the holder or certain other related entities. 
At any time however, it is convertible, share for share, into common stock with
one vote per share.  Class B stock transferred to persons or entities  not
entitled to receive it as Class B stock will automatically be converted to and
issued as common stock to the transferee.  Holders of Class B stock receive
equal dividends per share as holders of common stock. 

During fiscal 1994, the Company repurchased 1,192,000 shares of common stock at
a cost of $46,862,000 under authorizations by its Board of Directors (1,050,000
shares repurchased in fiscal 1993 for $29,001,000 and 1,032,000 shares
repurchased in fiscal 1992 for $26,883,000).


7. Non-recurring Items

In the second quarter of fiscal 1994, a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $4.8
million was recorded to establish a reserve for taxes on disposed properties. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, $3 million of this reserve was reversed,
based on the resolution of a reserved assessment at no tax cost to the Company.

                                     F-16

<PAGE>
Also in the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter, a pre-tax charge of $5,584,000 was
recorded for the write-down of film assets at the Phoenix television station 
(KPHO) due to its affiliation agreement with CBS.  

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992, non-recurring items of $26,383,000 (pre-
tax) were charged to operations.  These items included $12,983,000 in
restructuring charges related to the Company's special voluntary early
retirement program and selective job eliminations; a $10 million Book Group
write-down of obsolete and excess inventory and unrecoverable deferred
promotion costs due to repositioning and downsizing its direct mail operations;
and $3.4 million for other corporate charges.


8. Income Taxes

On July 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting For Income
Taxes."  (The Company previously complied with the provisions of SFAS No. 96.) 
The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 109 was not material to the financial
statements.  Therefore, the prior period's financial statements have not been
restated.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted in the first quarter of
fiscal 1994, raised the basic corporate federal income tax rate from 34 percent
to 35 percent.  The effect of the increase on the Company's financial
statements for fiscal 1994 was $1,895,000 ($1,238,000 expense for the increase
in net deferred tax liabilities, $118,000 expense due to an additional
provision required for six months of fiscal 1993 and $539,000 additional
expense for fiscal 1994).

Components of income tax expense are as follows:

9. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits 


Pension Plans
- - -------------

The Company has noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all
employees.  The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually the maximum
amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.  Contributions are
intended to provide not only benefits attributed to service to date but also
for those expected to be earned in the future.  Assets held in the plans are a
mix of equity and debt securities.  Benefits for non-bargained plans are
determined based on length of service and compensation rates at retirement. 
For bargained plans, benefits are determined based on negotiated accruals.

Net periodic pension cost includes the following components:

expenses and settlement losses related to the early retirement program of
$2,841,000 charged as restructuring costs and a settlement loss of $1,426,000
in other corporate charges.

The weighted-average assumed discount rates used in determining the projected
benefit obligation at June 30, 1994 and 1993 were 7.5 percent before retirement
and 6.25 percent after retirement.  The rate of increase used for future
compensation levels at June 30, 1994 and 1993 was 6.0 percent.  The 
weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on assets were 8.5 percent 
for fiscal 1994, and 9.0 percent for fiscal 1993.


Postretirement Benefits
- - -----------------------

The Company sponsors a defined health care plan and a defined life insurance
plan which provide benefits to eligible retirees.  The health plan is
contributory with retiree contributions adjusted annually.  A portion of the


                                     F-20


<PAGE>



Company's contribution is a fixed dollar amount based on age and years of
service at retirement.  The health insurance plan contains the cost-sharing
features of coinsurance and/or deductibles.  The life plan is paid for by the
Company.  Benefits under both plans are based on eligible status for retirement
and length of service.  Substantially all of the Company's employees may become
eligible for these benefits upon reaching age 55 and having worked for the
Company at least 10 years.

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  Cash payments
related to retiree health and life benefits were $899,000 in fiscal 1994 and
$1,185,000 and $709,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  In fiscal 1993, the
Company began funding its postretirement benefits through a 401(h) account. 
All assets are held in equity securities.  Adoption of the rule in fiscal 1992
resulted in a reduction of net income for that year of $7.8 million, including
a $7.3 million post-tax charge for the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation ($11.8 million) accrued as of July 1, 1991, which the Company
recognized upon adoption.

A summary of the components of net periodic other postretirement benefit costs

The weighted-average assumed discount rate used in determining the actuarial
present value of other postretirement benefits was 7.5 percent at June 30,1994
and 1993.  The weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in the health
care cost trend rate for employees under age 65 was 15.0 and 16.0 percent for
June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  It is expected to decrease by 1.0
percent annually to 6.5 percent in 2002 and remain at that level.  For
employees 65 and older, the assumed rate of increase was 12.0 and 13.0 percent
at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  It is expected to decrease by 1.0
percent annually to 6.5 percent in 1999 and remain at that level.  By
increasing the trend rate by one percentage point each year, the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for retiree health benefits would increase as
of June 30, 1994, and June 30, 1993, by $1,069,000 and $1,016,000,
respectively.  The net periodic postretirement health care benefit cost would
increase by $163,000 for both fiscal 1994 and 1993.  The weighted-average rate
of compensation increase used to determine the accumulated benefit obligation
for life insurance benefits was 6.0 percent at June 30, 1994 and 1993.  The
weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5
percent for fiscal 1994.

10. Acquisitions

The acquisition of North Central Cable Communications Corporation ("North
Central"), a corporation operating cable television systems in the
Minneapolis/St. Paul area, by Meredith/New Heritage Strategic Partners, L.P. 
("Strategic Partners"), a limited partnership between Meredith/New Heritage
Partnership and Continental Cablevision of Minnesota, Inc., for approximately
$220 million, occurred on September 1, 1992.  Meredith Corporation has a 70
percent indirect ownership in Strategic Partners through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Meredith Cable, Inc.  The acquisition was accounted for by the
purchase method.  From the acquisition date of September 1, 1992, North
Central's revenues and net operating loss included in Meredith Corporation's
Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993,
were $35,778,000 and $(2,902,000) respectively.

A cable television system serving the Bismarck/Mandan, North Dakota, area was
acquired by Meredith/New Heritage Partnership on January 1, 1992.  This system
was contributed to Strategic Partners at the time of the North Central
acquisition, reducing the Company's indirect ownership interest in the North
Dakota system to 70 percent.

Twelve months of operations for the cable television systems are included in
the financial statements for fiscal 1994. The proforma effects (as if the
acquisitions of the cable television systems occurred at the beginning of
Meredith Corporation's 1993 and 1992 fiscal years) on selected income statement
items are as follows:

Recognition of goodwill and non-competition agreements as intangible assets
resulted from the purchase.  Goodwill is being amortized over 40 years and non-
competition agreements are being amortized over 5 years, both on straight-line
bases.

In August 1994, the Company announced plans to acquire the assets of WSMV-TV,
an NBC affiliate serving Nashville, Tennessee, from Cook Inlet Television
Partners (see Note 16).


11. Sale of Properties 

On December 26, 1993, the Company sold the net assets of WTVH, a CBS affiliate
licensed to serve Syracuse, New York, and the common stock of a Company
subsidiary that owned KSEE, an NBC affiliate licensed to serve Fresno,
California, for a pre-tax gain of $11,997,000 ($8,197,000 post-tax).

The Company sold Metropolitan Home magazine to Hachette Publications, Inc., in
November 1992.  The Company sold the net assets of its Real Estate relocation
operation to PHH Homequity Corporation in September 1991.

The gains or losses on these sales are included in net earnings for their
respective year.  If these sales had occurred on July 1 of the respective
fiscal year, the impacts on the Company's consolidated revenues and earnings
would not have been significant.


12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

The Company occupies certain facilities and sales offices and uses certain
equipment under lease agreements.  Rental expense for such leases was
$7,727,000 in 1994; $7,824,000 in 1993; and $6,777,000 in 1992.  Minimum rental
commitments at June 30, 1994, under all noncancellable operating leases are
payable as follows:

In the normal course of business, leases that expire are generally renewed or
replaced by leases on similar property.

Film rental contracts payable are noninterest-bearing, and the amounts due in
the years after June 30, 1995, are $2,885,000 in 1996; $1,202,000 in 1997; and
$31,000 in 1998.  The Company is also obligated to make payments under
contracts for programs not currently available for use and, therefore, not
included in the consolidated financial statements, in the amount of $19,006,000
at June 30, 1994 ($20,219,000 at June 30, 1993).  The portion of these payments
due in succeeding years is $4,893,000 in 1995; $6,323,000 in 1996; $4,723,000
in 1997; $2,161,000 in 1998; and $906,000 thereafter.

The purchase agreement related to the acquisition of North Central by Strategic
Partners provides for contingent payments to the former owners if actual cash
flows exceed certain targeted cash flows.  There were no contingent payments
owed for fiscal 1994 or 1993.  None are expected to be paid in the near future
(see Note 5).

The Company has been advised by Strategic Partners that it believes it has
complied in all material respects with the provisions of the Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 including rate setting
provisions.  However, since Strategic Partners' rates for regulated services
are subject to review, Strategic Partners may be subject to a customer refund
liability.  The amounts of refunds, if any, which could be payable by Strategic
Partners, in the event that rates are successfully challenged by franchising
authorities, is not currently estimable.

Strategic Partners has programming agreements with three cable commissions to
provide local programming.  These agreements require annual payments of
approximately $1 million (see Note 15).

The Company received federal income tax deficiency notices relative to its 1986
through 1990 tax years. Generally, the claimed deficiencies related to the
amortization of intangibles and other matters connected with the acquisition of
Ladies' Home Journal magazine.  The Company contested these deficiencies in the
United States Tax Court.  On March 14, 1994, Meredith Corporation received a
favorable decision from the Tax Court.  The dominant issue, determined in favor
of the Company, involved the tax basis and ability to amortize the Ladies' Home
Journal subscriber relationships.  Because the Tax Court applied the 1993
decision of the United States Supreme Court in Newark Morning Ledger Co. v.
United States to the facts of the Company's case, management believes an appeal
by the Internal Revenue Service of the Tax Court's opinion is unlikely.  The
appeal period will expire as of September 16, 1994.  Absent appeal, the Company
will have no remaining exposure to the $12 million potential tax cost that was
previously reported and will recognize a material and favorable impact on net
earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 1995.

See Note 16 regarding the Company's plan to purchase WSMV-TV.

In the opinion of management, all other existing litigation and claims are not
considered to be material in relation to the Company's financial position.

See Financial Information about Industry Segments in Part I, Item 1(b) of this
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.



15. Cable Franchise Agreements

The cable television operations have nonexclusive franchise agreements with
cable commissions in their areas.  The Minnesota system's agreements are with
six cable commissions and expire from 1997 to 2001.  The North Dakota system's
agreements are with two cable commissions and expire in 2011 and 2013.  These
franchise agreements require the payment of fees, generally 5 percent of
operating revenues.  Additionally, certain franchise agreements require
Strategic Partners to provide community television programming.  Strategic
Partners has entered into programming agreements with three cable television
commissions in Minnesota to provide certain local community cable television
programming.  These agreements require annual payments of approximately $1
million (generally adjusted annually by consumer price index based escalator
clauses) and are effective for the term of the franchise agreements and any
renewals thereof.  Cable management believes that its operations are materially
in compliance with the terms of the franchise agreements in each of the
municipalities in which it offers cable television services (see Note 12).



16. Subsequent Event 

On August 19, 1994, the Company announced that it reached an agreement to
acquire the assets of WSMV-TV, an NBC affiliate in Nashville, Tennessee, from
Cook Inlet Television Partners, L.P.  The Company will pay $159 million for
WSMV-TV and plans to acquire the television station using cash and debt
financing.  The acquisition is expected to close in January 1995, pending
Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory approvals.  Nashville is
the country's 33rd largest television market.

Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 1994.  In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we
also audited the related financial statement schedules as listed in Part IV,
Item 14(a)2 herein.  These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Meredith
Corporation and subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

                         and Results of Operations


       Results of Operations:  Fiscal 1994 Compared with Fiscal 1993


Meredith Corporation net earnings for the year ended June 30, 1994, were
$27,154,000, or $1.91 per share.  Net earnings included a gain of $11,997,000
($8,197,000 post-tax or 57 cents per share) on the dispositions of the Syracuse
and Fresno television properties and a charge of $7,384,000 ($3,987,000 post-
tax or a negative 28 cents per share) for non-recurring items.  Excluding the
post-tax impacts of the gain on dispositions and non-recurring items,
comparable earnings were $22,944,000, or $1.62 per share, a 33 percent increase
from prior-year earnings per share of $1.22 (earnings of $18,626,000).  All
operating groups, except cable, contributed to this increase.  Twelve cents of
the comparable per-share increase resulted from fewer shares outstanding due to
shares repurchased by the Company.

The net assets of WTVH, a CBS affiliate licensed to serve Syracuse, New York,
and the common stock of a Company subsidiary that owned KSEE, an NBC affiliate
licensed to serve Fresno, California, were sold to Granite Broadcasting
Corporation in December 1993.  The effect on fiscal 1994 consolidated
advertising revenues and profits was not material when compared with the prior
year.  However, Broadcast Group assets declined approximately 15 percent due to
the sale.

The Company received tax assessments in the second quarter of fiscal 1994
related to discontinued operations sold in prior years.  At that time, a non-
recurring pre-tax charge of $4.8 million was recorded to establish a reserve
for possible tax liabilities.  In the fourth quarter, favorable resolution of
an assessment (at no tax cost to the Company) led to the reversal of $3 million
of the reserve.  The Company continues to protest the remaining assessment but
believes the reserve is sufficient to cover any potential liability.

Also in the fourth quarter, the Company announced that KPHO, its independent
station in Phoenix, will affiliate with CBS in September 1994 and WNEM, its NBC
affiliate serving Flint/Saginaw/Bay City, Michigan, will affiliate with CBS in
fiscal 1995.  Due to the planned affiliation of KPHO with CBS, the future
values of license agreements for owned programming rights were reviewed.  As a
result, management determined it was necessary to record a non-recurring pre-
tax charge of $5,584,000 in the fourth quarter to write-down certain KPHO film
assets.

The Company reported record revenues in fiscal 1994 of $799,526,000, a four
percent increase from prior-year revenues of $768,848,000.  Factors
contributing to the increase included higher magazine circulation revenues, an
additional two months of revenue from the Minnesota cable television system
(purchased in September 1992), and increased retail and direct response book
sales volumes.

Fiscal 1994 income from operations was $49,637,000 compared with $40,909,000 in
the prior year.  The operating margin rose from 5.3 percent of net revenues
last year to 6.2 percent in the current year, despite the negative effect of
non-recurring items.  Excluding the effect of non-recurring items, the
operating margin was 7.1 percent, a 34 percent increase from the comparable
prior-year margin. 

Production, distribution and editorial expenses, as a percentage of revenues,
declined from 42 percent in fiscal 1993 to 41 percent in fiscal 1994, primarily
due to lower programming expense at the broadcast television stations. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses also declined as a percentage of
revenues, from 49 percent in fiscal 1993 to 48 percent in fiscal 1994.  A
favorable adjustment to accrued music license fees in the Broadcast Group,
based on an industry settlement with ASCAP/BMI (American Society of Composers,
Authors & Publishers and Broadcast Music Industry) was the single biggest 
factor.  Other significant factors included lower promotion expenses in the
Book Group and lower administrative expenses due to relocating Craftways
operations from California to Des Moines in fiscal 1993.


A discussion of results by segment follows:

Publishing:  Revenues in the Magazine Group increased four percent from fiscal
1993 to a record level.  Magazine advertising revenues from on-going titles
increased four percent from the prior year (excluding the revenues of
Metropolitan Home magazine, sold in November 1992).  Advertising revenues were
down slightly at Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal magazines
primarily due to fewer ad pages.  These declines were more than offset by
increased ad revenues in most of the Company's other titles.  Increases of more
than 20 percent were reported by Traditional Home, Country America and Golf For
Women magazines, and the American Park Network collection of visitor guides,
primarily due to additional ad pages.  These publications also reported a
higher net revenue per page.  The strength in the Company's advertising page
sales has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 1995. 



                                      F-31


<PAGE>


Circulation revenues in the Magazine Group increased seven percent when
compared with the prior year.  Higher newsstand sales volume of the Better
Homes and Gardens Special Interest Publications was the biggest factor in the
increase.  Newsstand sales of several new Ladies' Home Journal special issues
and higher subscription revenues, due to increased sales volume of newer titles
including Better Homes and Gardens American Patchwork & Quilting, also
contributed.

Record operating profits were reported in the Magazine Group for the second
consecutive year.  Operating profits increased 12 percent over the prior year's
record performance.  Increased ad revenues for many titles and improved
newsstand sales and profits for the Group were the most significant factors in
the profit improvement.  Results for the Better Homes and Gardens Special
Interest Publications, Ladies' Home Journal (including special issues) and
Traditional Home magazine benefited from increased newsstand profits. 
Increased advertising revenues contributed to the profit improvements of
Country America, Traditional Home, Successful Farming, Country Home and
American Park Network.  Profits in the prior year were held down by a loss on
Metropolitan Home magazine and by moving costs associated with relocating
Craftways magazine operations to Des Moines.  

Profits were down in the custom publishing area due to start-up costs
associated with Crayola Kids (a magazine aimed at children ages 3 to 8 and
their parents that is published under a license from Binney & Smith Properties,
Inc.) and lower profit margins on periodical and premium sales.  Better Homes
and Gardens magazine reported a slight decline in profits due to fewer
advertising pages.

Total Book Group revenues were essentially unchanged from the prior year.
Consumer book revenues were up six percent due to increased sales volume in the
retail marketing and direct response operations, partially offset by lower
sales volume in the book clubs due to planned downsizing.  This increase was
offset by a decline in revenues in Craftways operations due to lower volumes.

Book Group operating results showed improvement from fiscal 1993.  Record
profits in the Group's retail marketing operations reflected increased sales of
both new and backlist titles.  The sales volume increase included a major sale
of gardening titles to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., that coincided with the January
opening of the Better Homes and Gardens Garden Centers in more than 2,000 Wal-
Mart stores nationwide. The book clubs reported improved results due to lower
manufacturing, delivery and promotion expenses.  Cost savings associated with
the consolidation of Craftways editorial and marketing operations with Book
Group operations in Des Moines also contributed to the Group's improved
results.


                                      F-32

<PAGE>


Operating results in the direct response area showed little change from the
prior year, despite the growth expected from this business. Lower-than-expected
response rates have continued to hold back the Group's direct response
business.  Efforts are continuing to develop more effective ways to use the
Company's 63 million-name database and to improve product research and
development for direct response.

The Company began to realize revenues and profits from its licensing agreement
with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., in fiscal 1994 related to the Better Homes and
Gardens Garden Centers.

Paper and postage are significant and essential expenses in the Publishing
segment.  Paper prices have been fairly stable over the past year due to soft
market conditions and increased international competition.  The Company does
not expect to experience a shortage of paper in the foreseeable future. 
However, the paper market has recently tightened and price increases could
occur.  A price increase estimated at 5 to 10 percent is possible in the first
half of fiscal 1995.  The Company also anticipates a postal rate increase in
fiscal 1995.

Broadcast:  Broadcast Group revenues in fiscal 1994 declined slightly from the
prior year due to the sale of two television stations in December 1993. 
Revenues at the five remaining television stations increased eight percent from
comparable prior-year revenues due to overall increases in local and national
advertising revenues.  Each of the five stations recorded increased advertising
revenues in fiscal 1994.  The growth primarily reflected increased market
demand for advertising resulting in higher spot rates.  KPHO in Phoenix
reported the biggest increase with double-digit percentage gains in both local
and national advertising revenues.  A stronger sales effort and an improving
economy in the Phoenix market contributed to the increase.  The strength in the
Company's television advertising sales has continued into the first quarter of
fiscal 1995. 
 
Profits increased 16 percent in the Broadcast Group despite a non-recurring
charge of $5,584,000 for the write-down of certain film assets at KPHO.  Upon
becoming a network affiliate, approximately one-half of its programming hours
will be supplied by CBS.  WNEM, an NBC affiliate serving the Flint/Saginaw/Bay
City, Michigan, market, also plans to change affiliation to CBS during fiscal
1995.  There will be initial increases in promotion and marketing expenses at
both stations.  In addition, KPHO will add staff and incur costs associated
with expanding its news department.  Management believes these changes will
strengthen the Broadcast Group.  In particular, management expects the CBS
affiliation in Phoenix to have a favorable long-term effect on Broadcast Group
revenues and profits.


                                      F-33

Excluding the non-recurring charge, Broadcast Group profits increased 50
percent from fiscal 1993.  Advertising revenue increases at the five remaining
stations, along with lower programming expenses and music license fees,
resulted in the profit increase.  Programming costs have been held down by a
combination of cost-saving measures, including the purchase of more first-run
programming.  This trend is expected to continue in fiscal 1995.  The favorable
adjustment to accrued music license fees reflected the settlement between the
broadcast industry and ASCAP/BMI.  As with revenues, KPHO reported the most
substantial improvement in operating results of the five stations, primarily
due to the revenue increase and lower programming expense.  

In August 1994, the Company announced plans to purchase WSMV-TV, an NBC
affiliate serving Nashville, Tennessee, for $159 million.  The purchase from
Cook Inlet Television Partners, L.P. is expected to close in January 1995,
subject to Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory approvals. 
Nashville is the country's 33rd largest television market.  Broadcast Group
revenues and profits are expected to increase due to the purchase.

Real Estate:  Revenues increased four percent in the Real Estate Group, while
profits showed significant improvement from fiscal 1993.  Transaction fees, the
revenues generated by members' sales volume, increased nine percent due to
continued strength in the residential housing market and record gross
commission income of the member firms.  Revenues from the sale of ancillary
products and services also increased, primarily due to higher volumes.  A
decline in joining fees partially offset other revenue increases.  Improved
profits for the Group primarily reflected the revenue increases and lower
administrative and bad debt expenses.

The residential home resale market has been very strong in the last few years,
due in part to the availability of low interest rate home mortgages.  Recent
increases in home mortgage interest rates could contribute to a slowdown in
home sales, leading to lower commission income for members and thus, lower fees
paid to the Group.

Cable Television:  An 18 percent increase in revenues for the cable television
operations primarily reflected the timing of the Minnesota system acquisition
on September 1, 1992.  This system is the larger of two cable television
systems of which the Company indirectly owns approximately 70 percent.  At June
30, 1994, the two cable television systems served a total of 133,000
subscribers.  Subscriber counts increased five percent at the Minnesota system
and three percent at the Bismarck system during fiscal 1994.  Basic subscriber
penetration rates also increased at both systems, as did the percentage of
subscribers receiving pay services.  However, average revenue per subscriber
was down slightly due to the effect of government re-regulation of cable
pricing in September 1993.


                                      F-34

<PAGE>


The decline in average revenue per subscriber, increased programming costs and
expenses associated with rate re-regulation resulted in lower operating profits
(before interest expense) for the cable television systems.  Increased
amortization of acquisition expenses (associated with the Minnesota system
purchase) and increased depreciation expense also contributed to the decline. 
Interest expense pertaining to the cable television segment increased due to
timing of the Minnesota system acquisition and bank fees paid to buy-out
interest rate contracts.  Thus the cable operations experienced a larger net
loss in fiscal 1994.

In April 1993, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted new federal
standards for local franchise regulation of cable television rates.  These
regulations were effective on September 1, 1993, and required cable television
systems operating above a price benchmark average to reduce rates from their
September 30, 1992, level.  In May 1994, revised benchmark regulations were
adopted by the FCC requiring cable television systems to further reduce rates
from September 1992 levels or to new benchmarks.  (Rates can be adjusted in the
future for certain costs and inflation.)  Cable management believes it has
complied in all material respects with federal standards.  Operating cash flows
for the cable operations are expected to decline approximately six percent in
fiscal 1995 due to the additional rate regulations.

The cable industry outlook has changed considerably since the Company decided
to invest in the cable partnership in the fall of 1991.  Re-regulation of cable
pricing, changes in cable technology and competitive developments are the
primary factors affecting the industry.  In light of these changes, the Company
is evaluating its options in relation to its continued investment in cable
television.  The cable television systems have been listed for sale;
however, a formal plan of disposal has not yet been adopted.  Although selling
the systems is the most likely strategy, the  Company is also considering other
arrangements.  Whatever alternative is selected, the Company believes it will
materially recover its investment.

Other:  The increase in fiscal 1994 interest expense primarily reflects two
additional months of debt financing versus fiscal 1993 related to the timing of
the Minnesota cable television system acquisition.  Corporate nonoperating
expenses increased from fiscal 1993 mostly due to non-recurring charges,
reserves for certain corporate assets and a $1.4 million write-down of a
building to its estimated realizable value.  The building write-down resulted
from the decision to consolidate Des Moines employees in one location with the
construction of a new building next to the current Company headquarters.
Construction is expected to begin in fiscal 1996.

In the third quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company received a favorable ruling
regarding the Ladies' Home Journal tax case.  The appeal period, with respect
to the Tax Court's decision, expired on September 16, 1994 and the Company has
no remaining exposure to the $12 million potential tax cost that was previously
reported.  Approximately $12 million (post-tax benefit, including interest)
will be received by the Company as a result of the favorable decision in this
case.  A portion of this judgment (that related to current versus deferred tax
benefits) will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 1994 exceeds the prior-year rate primarily
due to the increase in the federal corporate tax rate enacted in August 1993. 
Accounting rules require that the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax
items be reflected in earnings in the period the change is enacted.  The effect
of the increased corporate tax rate was to reduce fiscal 1994 earnings per
share by 13 cents.  The Company's effective tax rate also increased versus the
prior year due to the increased loss of the cable operations.  Most of
Meredith's share of these losses are non-deductible to the Company.  These
increases were partially offset by the favorable tax effect from the
disposition of the broadcast television stations.

In the fiscal 1992 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a charge for non-
recurring items that consisted primarily of restructuring charges and costs
associated with downsizing and repositioning the Book Group's direct mail
operations.  Restructuring charges were related to the Company's special
voluntary early retirement program and other selective job eliminations.  As of
June 30, 1994, most of the restructuring costs previously reserved had been
paid.  The number of employees in the Company's work force remains below the
comparable level prior to restructuring.  Special charges were also recognized
for the write-down of Book Group product inventory and promotional costs
(primarily due to the new focus and direction of the book clubs) and certain
other assets of the Company.  As expected, book club revenues have declined and
operating results have improved.  No further write-downs, other than ordinary
operating charges, have been required.



       Results of Operations:  Fiscal 1993 Compared with Fiscal 1992


Fiscal 1993 net earnings were $18,626,000, or $1.22 per share.  This compared
with the fiscal 1992 net loss of $6,331,000, or a negative 39 cents per
share.  Fiscal 1992 results were affected by the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and the recognition of non-
recurring items.  Excluding these factors, fiscal 1992 earnings were


                                      F-36

<PAGE>

$17,326,000, or $1.07 per share.  The fiscal 1993 increase in comparable
earnings reflected improved performance in Publishing.  The Magazine Group
reported record profits and the Book Group showed significant improvement from
fiscal 1992 results.  These improvements were partially offset by the negative
effect of the Company's investments in cable television.  A lower number of
shares outstanding, due to the Company's share repurchase program, added seven
cents to earnings per share in fiscal 1993.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 on the immediate recognition basis effective
July 1, 1991.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was
a negative post-tax impact of $7,300,000, or 45 cents per share.  Non-recurring
items recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992 had a negative post-tax
impact of $16,357,000, or $1.01 per share.  These items consisted of
restructuring charges ($12,983,000 pre-tax), costs associated with downsizing
and repositioning the Book Group's direct mail operations ($10,000,000 pre-tax)
and other corporate charges ($3,400,000 pre-tax).

Net revenues were $768,848,000 for the year ended June 30, 1993.  This
represents a nine percent increase from fiscal 1992 revenues of $706,662,000. 
The acquisition of a cable television system in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area
on September 1, 1992, by a partnership in which the Company has an indirect
ownership interest, was the most significant factor in the increase.  Higher
Magazine Group revenues also contributed.

Income from operations was $40,909,000 in fiscal 1993.  This compares with
income from operations, before non-recurring items, of $22,611,000 in the prior
year. Revenue increases and reduced production, distribution and editorial
(PD&E) expenses were the primary factors in the improvement.

PD&E expenses declined from 46 percent of revenues in fiscal 1992 to 42 percent
of revenues in fiscal 1993.  This decrease was caused by lower magazine
production costs, reduced editorial staff levels (primarily from the fiscal
1992 restructuring efforts), lower book inventory operating reserves and
reduced broadcast film expense.  PD&E expenses account for a relatively low
percentage of revenues in the cable operations as compared with the Company's
other segments.  Therefore, the growth of cable operations also contributed to
the decline in PD&E expenses as a percentage of total revenues.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $31
million but remained constant as a percentage of revenues.  The primary factors
in the overall increase were the cable television acquisitions and increased
magazine circulation costs, mostly related to the growth of newer titles.
 
The $15 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, up one
percent of revenues, reflected the impact of cable television acquisitions. 


                                      F-37

As expected, savings of approximately $8 million were realized in fiscal 1993
from the prior-year reductions in the Company's work force.


A discussion of results by segment follows:

Publishing:  Revenues in the Magazine Group increased five percent from fiscal
1992 primarily due to increases in advertising, subscription and other
revenues.  The increase in advertising revenues reflected strong advertising
page gains by most titles.  Total ad pages for comparable titles increased
seven percent, a gain of more than 400 pages.  These figures exclude the ad
pages of Metropolitan Home, the upscale shelter magazine that was sold in
November 1992.  Increased per copy subscription revenue for Better Homes and
Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal combined with the growth of newer magazines to
cause the increase in subscription revenues.  One of the fastest-growing titles
was Country America, which grew from a circulation base of 700,000 in fiscal
1992 to 1 million in February 1993.  Better Homes and Gardens American
Patchwork & Quilting, introduced with the April 1993 issue, and Decorative
Woodcrafts, new in fiscal 1992, also contributed to the new title growth in
subscription revenues.  Continued growth in Meredith Custom Marketing led to
increased revenues, including a multi-faceted sale to Chrysler Corporation.

The Magazine Group experienced record profits in fiscal 1993 as operating
profits increased more than 30 percent from fiscal 1992.  Much of the
improvement can be attributed to the strong performances of the Company's two
largest titles:  Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal.  These
magazines recorded advertising revenue gains of eight and six percent,
respectively.  When combined with favorable production costs, the result was
record profits for both titles.  The same factors contributed to double-digit
percentage growth in profits for Better Homes and Gardens Special Interest
Publications, WOOD and Midwest Living.  Improved results from three newer
titles, Country America, Traditional Home and Decorative Woodcrafts, also
contributed to the Group's profit increase.  Fiscal 1992 profits were held down
by expenses related to the discontinuation of a British version of Metropolitan
Home.

Craftways, which publishes Cross Stitch & Country Crafts magazine, and American
Park Network were the only Magazine Group operations suffering significant
declines in performance in fiscal 1993.  Craftways operations were moved from
California to the Company's headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, in the spring of
1993.  Expenses related to the move were the major factor contributing to the
decline in Craftways performance.  Lower ad revenues were the primary factor in
the profit decline at American Park Network. 



                                      F-38

<PAGE>
Book Group revenues were up more than one percent versus fiscal 1992 as
declines due to downsizing were offset by increases in other areas.  As
expected, gross revenues in the book club and syndication operations declined. 
However, fewer product returns lowered the impact on net revenues.  These
changes reflected the strategic repositioning and downsizing of operations in
the past two years which led to the recognition of non-recurring items in
fiscal 1992.  The direct response and retail marketing operations experienced
increased revenues over fiscal 1992.  An increased number of product offerings
boosted revenues in direct response.  Higher sales of backlist titles and lower
product returns were primary factors in the retail marketing revenue increase.

Book Group operating results improved significantly in fiscal 1993.  Much of
the improvement was due to the $10 million pre-tax charge for non-recurring
items recorded in fiscal 1992 for the write-down of inventory and promotional
costs related to the downsizing of direct mail operations.  No write-downs of
Book Group inventory, other than ordinary recognition of obsolete and dated
materials, occurred in fiscal 1993.  Book club results reflected the benefits
of downsizing through reduced spending for recruitment of new members.  Fewer
product returns and lower bad debt rates resulting from a more targeted
membership base also contributed to the improvement.  Record retail marketing
profits occurred due to increased net sales and lower costs of sales,
especially the cost of damaged returns.  Reduced staff levels, particularly in
editorial areas, were also a factor in the improved Book Group results.

Despite a significant increase in revenue, direct response results were down
compared with fiscal 1992.  Increased promotion spending (due to new product
testing), higher bad debt and product return rates and increased database
expense caused the decline.

As anticipated, the Company's net investment in the Book Group at June 30,
1993, remained below the level achieved following the fiscal 1992 write-downs.

Paper is an essential raw material in the Publishing segment and represents a
significant expense. Softness in the paper market and successful negotiations
with suppliers brought paper prices in fiscal 1993 below the level paid in
fiscal 1992. 

Broadcast:  Fiscal 1993 was a year of mixed results in the Broadcast Group.
National advertising revenues, which showed improvement late in fiscal 1992,
declined sharply in the southern and western markets in the fiscal 1993 second
quarter.  Soft conditions continued through the remainder of fiscal 1993.  The
Las Vegas and Phoenix markets were particularly hard hit.  Local revenues were
weak in most markets through the first half of the year, but rallied in the
second half.  Only KSEE, the group's NBC affiliate in Fresno, finished fiscal
1993 with local revenues appreciably below fiscal 1992.  Overall, Broadcast
Group revenues were down slightly from fiscal 1992 with four of the Company's
seven television stations reporting lower revenues.

                                      F-39

<PAGE>

Broadcast Group operating profits also were down slightly in fiscal 1993. 
Increased employee benefits expense and decreased revenues caused the decline
in profits.  Partially offsetting these factors were lower programming costs
due to increased use of first-run programming.  As with revenues, results were
mixed at the stations, with three stations posting improvements over fiscal
1992. 

Real Estate:  Revenues in the Real Estate Group increased slightly over fiscal
1992.  Increases in custom product and publication sales, and higher joining
and franchise fees more than offset the decline in revenues resulting from the
fiscal 1992 sale of the relocation operation.  Real Estate Group earnings,
including interest income, increased three percent in fiscal 1993 primarily due
to the increase in revenues.

Cable Television:  Cable revenues, assets and operating profits before interest
expense increased substantially in fiscal 1993 due to the timing of
acquisitions.  Fiscal 1993 results included 10 months of operations for the
Minnesota system and a full year of operations for the North Dakota system. 
(Fiscal 1992 included only six months of operations for the North Dakota
system.)  At June 30, 1993, the two cable television systems served a total of
127,000 subscribers.  Basic subscriber penetration rates in the North Dakota
system exceeded the national average of approximately 61 percent.  In addition,
more than half of those homes also subscribed to pay services.  The cable
television system owned in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area was one of the leaders
in subscribers and penetration rates in that market due to customer service and
promotional efforts.  Interest expense and amortization of intangibles
associated with the purchase of the Minnesota cable television system resulted
in a fiscal 1993 loss for the cable operations. 

Other:  Unallocated corporate expenses declined significantly in fiscal 1993
due to the recognition of non-recurring items in fiscal 1992.  Excluding these
non-recurring charges, there was no material change in the level of corporate
expenses.

Interest expense increased by more than $9 million in fiscal 1993 due to the
cable partnership's interest expense.  Interest income declined from fiscal
1992 due to lower interest-earning cash balances.  Cash balances were down due
to the Company's increased investment in the cable television partnership,
stock repurchases, payments to the Company's pension plans and the payment of
severance and early retirement packages from the fiscal 1992 restructuring
efforts.

A lower effective tax rate in fiscal 1993 primarily reflected increased
earnings.  This effect was partially offset by a decline in tax-exempt interest
income and the net loss on the Minnesota cable television operation (providing
no tax benefit to the Company).

            Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Expenditures


Cash and cash equivalents increased by $19,388,000 to $37,957,000 at June 30,
1994, compared with a decrease in cash of $23,764,000 in fiscal 1993.  The
increase primarily resulted from the sale of two broadcast television
properties and the prior-year's investment in the cable partnership, less
increased share repurchases.

The Company purchased approximately 1,192,000 shares of its common stock at an
average price of $39.30 per share in fiscal 1994.  In fiscal 1993,
approximately 1,050,000 shares were purchased at an average price of $27.66 per
share.  As of June 30, 1994, up to 280,000 additional shares may be repurchased
under an existing authorization by the Board of Directors.  The status of the
repurchase program is reviewed at each quarterly Board of Directors meeting.

The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 12 percent, or two
cents per share, to 18 cents per share with dividends payable on March 15,
1994.  On an annual basis, the effect of this quarterly dividend increase of
two cents per share would be to increase dividends paid by approximately $1
million at the current number of shares outstanding.

Meredith/New Heritage Strategic Partners, L.P., ("Strategic Partners") has term
loan payments due to banks of approximately $11 million in fiscal 1995.
Borrowings are secured by the partnership interests and assets of Strategic
Partners.  This debt is non-recourse to Meredith Corporation.  The operating
cash flows of Strategic Partners may not provide sufficient funds to meet the
payment terms of the loan agreements without the sale of part or all of its
cable television systems or an amendment to the loan agreement amortization
schedule.  (Strategic Partners is currently exploring the disposition of its
cable television systems.)  Under the terms of the loan agreement, the proceeds
from any sale of cable television assets must be applied to reduce outstanding
borrowings.  The first payment is due September 30, 1994.  Although a formal
request has not been made, the lenders have indicated they would support a
request to extend the amortization period or to postpone future scheduled
payments in light of Strategic Partners' efforts to sell its assets in part or
in whole.  Strategic Partners' management intends and believes it will be able
to execute an amendment to the loan agreement to modify the amortization
schedule. 

Strategic Partners is prohibited by this loan agreement to make dividend
payments or any distributions to the partners except for specified payments
under certain conditions that would not cause a default under the loan
agreement.  The restricted net assets reflected in the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet at June 30, 1994, totalled approximately $91 million.  This
restriction has not had, and is not expected to have, any impact on the
Company's ability to meet its cash obligations.

Capital expenditures in fiscal 1994 increased by approximately 30 percent over
fiscal 1993 levels.  This increase was primarily due to the timing of the
Minnesota cable television system acquisition.  All planned expenditures in the
cable television systems occur in the ordinary course of business.  No material
commitments for expenditures to upgrade the cable distribution systems have
been made.  The Company also increased capital spending for new and upgraded
computer networks for the purpose of reducing long-term processing costs.  In
June 1994, the Company announced plans to construct a new building near its
current headquarters.  This will allow consolidation of all Des Moines-based
personnel in one campus.  The building and related improvements are expected to
cost approximately $36 million and will be financed through operating cash
flows or borrowings.  Construction is targeted to begin in fiscal 1996 and be
completed in fiscal 1998.  The Company has made no other material commitments
for capital expenditures.

The purchase of WSMV-TV for $159 million, as announced in August 1994, will
utilize cash and debt financing.  The Company is currently working with a group
of banks to arrange necessary financing.

At this time, management expects that cash on hand, plus internally-generated
cash flow, will provide funds for capital expenditures, cash dividends and
other operational cash needs for foreseeable periods.  Short-term lines of
credit will be used on an as-needed basis for short-term working capital needs. 
The Company does not expect the need for any long-term source of cash to meet
working capital requirements.



                             Cash Dividends

Cash dividends of $9,677,000 were paid in fiscal 1994.  This was a one percent
decline from the prior year due to shares repurchased by the Company.  An
increase in the per-share amount of the quarterly dividend, effective in the
third quarter, partially offset the impact of fewer shares outstanding.

days, nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, either
personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the

deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to
the shareholder at the address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the
corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

Section 5.  FIXING OF RECORD DATE.  For the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any
adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any
dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other
proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the corporation may fix in advance a
date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date
in any case to be not more than seventy days and, in case of a meeting of
shareholders, not less than ten days prior to the date on which the particular
action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken.  If no
record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive
payment of a dividend, the day before the first date on which notice of the
meeting is mailed or the day before the date on which the resolution of the
Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be,
shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders.  In order to
determine the shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting, the record
date shall be the sixtieth day preceding the date of receipt by the corporation
of written demands sufficient to require the calling of such meeting, unless
otherwise fixed by the Board of Directors.  When a determination of
shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as
provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof, unless the Board of Directors selects a new record date or unless a
new record date is required by law.

Section 6.  VOTING LISTS.  After the record date for a meeting has been fixed,
the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of
the corporation shall make, at least ten days before each meeting of
shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such
meeting, or any adjournment thereof, arranged by voting group and within each
voting group, in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number and
class of shares held by each, which list, for a period beginning two business
days after notice of the meeting was first given for which the list was
prepared and continuing through the meeting, shall be kept on file at the
principal office of the corporation or at the place identified in the meeting


                                       2

notice in the city where the meeting will be held.  The list shall be subject
to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours.  Such
list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting
and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time
of the meeting.  The list furnished to the corporation by its stock transfer
agent shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to
examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

Section 7.  QUORUM.  At any meeting of the shareholders, a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group constitutes a quorum
of that voting group for action on that matter, unless the representation of a
different number is required by law, and in that case, the representation of
the number so required shall constitute a quorum.  If a quorum shall fail to
attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or a majority of the votes
present may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time.  When a meeting
is adjourned to another place, date or time, notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date
of any adjourned meeting is more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the
date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the place, date and time of the
adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith.  At any adjourned
meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
original meeting.

Section 8.  PROXIES.  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote
by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by the shareholder's duly
authorized attorney in fact.  Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of
the corporation before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid
after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided
in the proxy.  No holder of any share of any class of stock of the corporation
shall sell the vote pertaining to such share or issue a proxy to vote such
share in consideration of any sum of money or anything of value.

     the Bylaws or any part thereof, pursuant to Article V of the Articles of
     Incorporation; and

     (iii) Any repeal or amendment of Article IV or Article VI of the Articles
     of Incorporation.

Section 10.  VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Shares standing in the name
of another corporation may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the
Bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision,
as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.

Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be
voted, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares.  Shares
standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person
or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares so held without a
transfer of such shares into the name of the trustee.

Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and
shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver

thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

Neither treasury shares nor, absent special circumstances, shares held by
another corporation if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the
election of directors of such other corporation is held by the corporation,
shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of
outstanding shares at any given time.

Section 2.  TRANSFER OF SHARES.  Upon surrender to the corporation or its
transfer agent of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by
proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be
the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled
thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction on its books.

Section 3.  RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP, TRANSFER AND VOTING.  So long as the
corporation or any of its subsidiaries is subject to any law of the United
States or any state therein which restricts ownership or voting of capital
stock by Aliens (as defined herein), not more than one-fifth of the shares
outstanding shall be owned of record or voted by or for the account of Aliens
or their representatives or affiliates. The Board of Directors may issue share
certificates representing not more than one-fifth of the shares of the stock of
the corporation at any time out-standing in special form which may be owned or
held by Aliens, such certificates to be known as "Foreign Share Certificates"
and to be so marked, but under no circumstances shall the total amount of
voting stock of any class represented by Foreign Share Certificates, plus the
amount of voting stock of that class owned by or for the account of Aliens and
represented by certificates not so marked, exceed one-fifth of the aggregate
number of outstanding shares of such class.

Shares of stock shall be transferable on the books of the corporation by the
holder thereof, in person or by duly authorized attorney, upon the surrender of
the certificate representing the shares to be transferred, properly endorsed;
provided, however, that shares of stock other than shares represented by
Foreign Share Certificates shall be transferable to Aliens or any person
holding for the account thereof only when the aggregate number of shares of
stock owned by or for the account of Aliens will not then be more than one-
fifth of the number of shares of stock outstanding.  The Board of Directors may
direct that, before shares of stock shall be transferred on the books of the
corporation, the corporation may require information as to whether the proposed
transferee is an Alien or will hold the stock for the account of an Alien.

If the stock records of the corporation shall at any time disclose Alien
ownership of one-fifth or more of the voting stock of any class and it shall be
found by the corporation that any certificate for shares marked "Domestic Share
Certificate" is, in fact, held by or for the account of any Alien, the holder
of the shares represented by that certificate shall not be entitled to vote, to
receive dividends or to have any other rights with respect to such shares,
except the right to transfer the shares to a Non-Alien (as defined herein).

If the stock records of the corporation shall at any time disclose Alien
ownership of one-fifth or more of the voting stock of any class and a request
is made by an Alien to have shares registered in its name or for its account,
the corporation shall be under no obligation to effect the transfer or to issue


                                      17

<PAGE>


or reissue any stock certificates to or for the account of the Alien.  In
addition, if a proposed transferee of any shares is an Alien, and the transfer
to such Alien would result in Alien ownership of one-fifth or more of the
voting stock of any class, the corporation shall be under no obligation to
effect the transfer or to issue or reissue any stock certificates to or for the
account of the Alien.  Further, if it is determined at any time that a transfer
has resulted in Alien ownership of one-fifth or more of the voting stock of any
class, the holder of the shares which resulted in the Alien ownership of one-
fifth or more of the voting stock shall not be entitled to vote, to receive
dividends or have any other rights with respect to such shares, except the
right to transfer those shares to a Non-Alien.

The Board of Directors shall establish rules, regulations and procedures to
assure compliance with and enforcement of this Article VII, Section 3.

The term "Alien" is defined to mean and include the following:

     (1)  Any person (including an individual, a partnership, a corporation or
          an association or any other entity) who is not a United States
          citizen or is the representative of or fiduciary for any person who
          is not a United States citizen;

     (2)  Any foreign government or the representative thereof;

     (3)  Any corporation any officer of which is an Alien, or of which more
          than 25% of its directors are Aliens;

     (4)  Any corporation or association organized under the laws of any
          foreign government;

     (5)  Any corporation of which more than 20% of its stock is owned
          beneficially or of record or may be voted by Aliens, or which by any
          other means whatsoever direct or indirect control of the corporation
          is held or permitted to be exercised by Aliens;

     (6)  Any partnership, association or other entity which is owned or
          controlled by Aliens;

     (7)  Any other person, corporation, trust, partnership or association
          deemed by the Board of Directors to be an Alien as to the United
          States or the corporation (or any subsidiary of the corporation).

          such class B holder or a spouse of any such lineal descendant, and

          or consolidation of such a corporation), or any partnership interest
          in such a partnership, is acquired by any person who is not within

          without further action, to be automatically converted into shares of
          common stock, and stock certificates formerly representing such

such purported transfer.  The corporation may, as a condition to the transfer
or the registration of transfer of shares of class B stock to a purported
Permitted Transferee, require the furnishing of such affidavits or other proof
as it deems necessary to establish that such transferee is a Permitted
Transferee.

otherwise provided by the laws of Iowa.

issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed certificate or
such owner's legal representative to give the corporation a bond in such sums
as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost or
destroyed.

Section 6.  STOCK REGULATIONS.  The Board of Directors shall have the power and
authority to make all such further rules and regulations not inconsistent with

the corporation under the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or under
the provisions of the Iowa Business Corporations Act, a waiver thereof in
writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the
giving of such notice.


       ARTICLE XII.  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES

Section 1.  RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION.  Each person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a
person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director,
officer or employee of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as director, officer or employee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the corporation to the fullest extent  consistent with the laws of Iowa as the
same now or may hereafter exist (but, in the case of any change, only to the
extent that such change authorizes the corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior
to such change) against all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered
by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall

provided, however, that the right to indemnification conferred in this Section
shall be conditioned upon the corporation being afforded the opportunity to
participate directly on behalf of such person in such proceeding and any
settlement discussions relating thereto.  The right to indemnification
conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall, except with
respect to an action or proceeding against the corporation by an employee who
is neither a director nor an officer of the corporation, include the right to
be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt by the corporation
of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director, officer or employee to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the
director, officer or employee is not entitled to be indemnified under this
Section or otherwise.

Section 2.  RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT.   If a claim under Section I of
this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty days after a
written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount
of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be
entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a
defense to any action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
corporation) that the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct which
makes it permissible under Iowa law for the corporation to indemnify the
claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall
be on the corporation.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because
such person has met such standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by
the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,
or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such standard of conduct,
nor the termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall create a
presumption that the claimant has failed to meet the required standard of
conduct.

Section 3.  NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.  The right to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
the Articles of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.



                                      24

Section 4.  INSURANCE.  The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense,
to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense,
liability or loss under Iowa law.

Section 5.  EXPENSES AS A WITNESS.  To the extent that any director, officer or
employee of the corporation is by reason of such position, or a position with
another entity at the request of the corporation, a witness in any proceeding,
such person shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses actually and
reasonably incurred in connection therewith.

Section 6.  EFFECT OF AMENDMENT.  Any amendment, repeal or modification of any
provision of this Article by the shareholders or the directors of the
corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director,
officer or employee of the corporation existing at the time of such amendment,
repeal or modification.

Section 7.  SEVERABILITY.  In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Article shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provisions of this Article.


                           ARTICLE XIII.  AMENDMENTS

These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted
by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors.
