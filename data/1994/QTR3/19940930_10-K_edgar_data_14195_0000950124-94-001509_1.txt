                                     PART I

Item1.  Business

Basic Business

Briggs & Stratton Corporation is the world's largest producer of air cooled
gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment and locks for automobiles and
trucks. The Company designs, manufactures, markets and services these products
for original equipment manufacturers worldwide.

Engines

Engines, parts and related products provided 93% of sales in fiscal 1994. These
engines were air cooled aluminum alloy gasoline engines ranging from 3 to 20
horsepower.

In fiscal 1994, approximately 85% of original equipment gasoline engine sales
were to manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment; approximately 15% were
to manufacturers of other powered equipment, primarily for the construction
industry and for agriculture. In the United States and Canada, engine sales
are made primarily directly to original equipment manufacturers.

Sales to the Company's largest engine customer, MTD Products Inc., were 18% of
total sales in fiscal 1994. Sales to its second largest customer, Tomkins PLC,
were 12% of sales and sales to its third largest customer, A B Electrolux, were
12% of sales. Under purchasing plans available to all gasoline engine
customers, the Company normally enters into annual engine supply agreements
with these producers of end products powered by the Company's gasoline engines.
Company management has no reason to anticipate a change from the continuation
of this practice or in its historical business relationships with these
companies.

The major domestic competitors of the Company in engine manufacturing are
Tecumseh Products Company, Kohler Co., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. and Onan
Corporation.  Also, two domestic lawn mower manufacturers, Toro Co. Inc.
through its Lawn-Boy Inc. branch and Honda Motor Co., Ltd., manufacture their
own engines. Eight Japanese small engine manufacturers, of which Honda and
Kawasaki are the largest, are worldwide competitors not only in the sale of
engines, but end products as well. Tecnamotor S.p.A., located in Italy and
owned by Tecumseh, is a major competitor in Europe. Major areas of competition
from all engine manufacturers are product quality, price, timely delivery and
service. The Company believes its product quality and service reputation have
given it the strong brand name identification it enjoys.

Servicing of all the Company's gasoline engine products is done by a network
of over 32,000 independent service parts distribution and repair outlets in
the United States and Canada and many foreign countries.

Manufacturing activity in the lawn and garden industry is driven by the need to
deliver new lawn mowers, garden tractors and tillers for retail sales in the
spring and early summer. Thus, demand from customers is at its height in their
winter and spring manufacturing season. Most engines are manufactured to
individual customer specifications. The Company offers financial incentives to
its OEMs to specify standardized engines; to take delivery during the off
season; and to commit early, for delivery at specific times during the busy
season. These programs, designed to level manufacturing activity, cause the
Company to build inventories of finished engines in the first and second
quarters.  Thus, sales generally are highest in the March quarter and weakest
in the September quarter. Customer orders in the last three months of the
fiscal year depend on spring retail sales, so the June quarter is the least
predictable.

                                      1
<PAGE>   4
Locks and Keys

Mechanical locks, electro-mechanical locks and related products provided
approximately 7% of sales in fiscal 1994. Customers are primarily the major
automobile and truck manufacturers in North America. Major competitors of the
Company in lock manufacturing are Hurd Lock & Manufacturing Company and
All-Lock Company, Inc.  Price, product quality, delivery performance and
technical support are major areas of competition.

A substantial portion of the Company's lock production is sold to two of the
three large North American automobile manufacturers as original equipment
components.  The loss of these customers would effectively eliminate the
Company's lock business. These manufacturers have been customers for many years
and the Company anticipates continued business in future years. However, the
largest of these customers has changed its purchasing practices. These
practices may change the level of business the Company receives from that
customer in the future.  A substantial reduction from the current level of
business with that customer would significantly impact the Company's lock
business.

Sales to original equipment customers are made by personnel from the Milwaukee
headquarters and Detroit sales office. Independent Sales Representatives are
utilized in servicing certain other industrial OEM accounts. Service parts
and replacement locks are sold to OEMs and to Locksmith Wholesalers.

In May, the Board of Directors approved the spin-off of the lock division to
the Company shareholders. It is currently anticipated that the spin-off will
occur in early calendar 1995.

General

The Company manufactures a majority of the components used in its
products and purchases the balance of its requirements. The Company
manufactures its own ductile and grey iron castings,  aluminum and zinc die
castings and a high percentage of other major components, such as carburetors
and ignition systems. The Company also purchases certain finished standard
commercial parts such as piston rings, spark plugs, valves and plastic
components, some stampings and screw machine parts and smaller quantities of
other components. Raw material purchases are for aluminum, steel, zinc and
brass. The Company believes its sources of supply are adequate.

The Company holds certain patents on features incorporated in its
products; however, the success of the Company's business is not considered to
be primarily dependent upon patent protection. Licenses, franchises and
concessions are not a material factor in the Company's business.

For the years ending July 3, 1994, June 27, 1993 and June 30, 1992, the Company
spent approximately $12,520,000, $10,411,000 and $10,808,000, respectively,
on Company sponsored research activities relating to the development of new
products or the improvement of existing products.

The average number of persons employed by the Company during the fiscal year
was 8,583. Employment ranged from a low of 7,879 in July 1993 to a high of
8,801 in December 1994.

Financial Information About Industry Segments

Financial information about industry segments appears in Note 3 of the 1994
Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference.

Export Sales

Export sales for fiscal 1994 were $264,866,000 (21% of total sales), for fiscal
1993 were $249,610,000 (22% of total sales) and for fiscal 1992 were
$210,728,000 (20% of total sales). These sales were principally to customers in
European countries.

Item 2.  Properties

The corporate offices as well as the Company's largest engine manufacturing
facility are located in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee. Three
other facilities located in the Milwaukee metropolitan area are used for
production, warehousing and distribution of engines and engine parts. These are
owned facilities containing approximately 3,232,000 square feet of office,
warehouse and production area. Engines also are manufactured at a 292,000
square foot owned facility in Murray, Kentucky and a 236,000 square foot owned
facility in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. The engine business is seasonal, with
demand for engines at its height in the winter and early spring. Engine
manufacturing operations run at capacity levels during the peak season, with
many operations running three shifts. Engine operations generally run one shift
in the summer, when demand is weakest and production is considerably under
capacity. During the winter, when finished goods inventories reach their
highest levels, owned warehouse space may be insufficient and capacity may be
expanded through rented space. Excess warehouse space exists in the spring and
summer seasons. In May, the Board of Directors approved a plan of relocation
for several of the Company's facilities over the next three years. The plan
provides for the expansion of existing facilities in Murray, Kentucky and
Poplar Bluff, Missouri and the establishment of three new engine manufacturing
facilities. The Company has announced the selection of sites in Statesboro,
Georgia and Auburn, Alabama for two of the facilities.  The Company's owned
properties are well maintained.

The Company leases 173,000 square feet of space to house its European warehouse
in the Netherlands and its foreign sales and service operations in Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The Company's domestic lock manufacturing facility is located in the Milwaukee
suburb of Glendale, Wisconsin. This facility has floor space of approximately
352,000 square feet. The Company also owns a 50,000 square foot assembly plant
in Juarez, Mexico. Both properties are well maintained and are adequate for its
current needs. Additional demand could be met through increased manufacturing
capacity gained by adding a shift.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

There are no pending legal proceedings that are required to be reported under
this item.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three months ended July 3,
1994.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards the
consolidated financial statements included in the Briggs & Stratton Corporation
Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and
have issued our report thereon dated July 28, 1994. Our audit was made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole. The
schedules listed in the accompanying index are the responsibility of the
Company's management and are presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the basic
consolidated financial statements. These schedules have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial
statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects the
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

                 BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES


                        DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT

         AGREEMENT made this 9th day of June, 1994, between Briggs & Stratton
Corporation (the "Company") and Frederick P. Stratton, Jr. (the "Executive").

         1.  DEFERRAL OF COMPENSATION. This Agreement shall operate to defer,
on an unfunded basis, compensation earned by the Executive as an employee of
the Company for the company's fiscal year ending in 1995, to the extent that
such compensation would otherwise be non-deductible under Section 162 (m) of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time. The amount deferred
hereunder shall be paid to the Executive as soon as practicable following the
Company fiscal year in which the executive terminates employment with the
Company, such payment to be made in one lump sum, or in such other manner as
may be agreed upon between the Executive and the Company's Nominating and
Salary Personnel Committee of the Board. Such agreement, if any, must occur
before the termination of employment by the Executive, or such payment shall be
in a lump sum.

         2.  DEATH OF EXECUTIVE. If the Executive dies prior to receiving all
funds payable hereunder, the entire unpaid balance shall be paid in the same
manner as provided for the Executive under the Company's Economic Value Added
Incentive Compensation Plan.

         3.  BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement has been approved by the Company's
Board of Directors and its Nominating and Salaried Personnel Committee, and
shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and
assigns and the Executive and his heirs, executors, administrators, and legal
representatives.

         4.  MISCELLANEOUS. Amounts deferred hereunder shall be credited with
interest on a book (unfunded) basis beginning on the last day of the Company
fiscal year for which a deferral is made, and continuing thereafter at a rate
equal to 80% of the prime rate made available to the best customers of Firstar
Bank Milwaukee N.A., and adjusted and compounded annually as of the last day of
each subsequent Company fiscal year until paid. Payment of deferrals hereunder
shall be subject to tax or other withholding requirements as may be required by
law. The Company's Board, or its Nominating and Salaried Personnel Committee,
shall have the power to modify or terminate this Agreement, but only with
consent of the Executive.

                                      16

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 3, 1994, JUNE 27, 1993 AND JUNE 30, 1992

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The significant accounting policies followed by Briggs & Stratton Corporation
and subsidiaries (the Company) in the preparation of these financial
statements, as summarized below, are in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Fiscal Year: During 1993, the Company changed its fiscal year from June 30 each
year to 52 or 53 week year ending on the Sunday nearest the last day of June in
each year.  Therefore, the 1994 fiscal year ended on July 3 (and was 53 weeks
long) and the 1993 fiscal year ended on June 27 (52 weeks).  Fiscal year 1992
was under the fiscal calendar which ended on June 30. All references to years
relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Briggs & Stratton Corporation and its wholly owned domestic and
foreign subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  This caption includes cash and certificates of
deposit.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term Investments: This caption represents short maturity mutual fund
investments that can be readily purchased or sold using established markets.  
These investments are stated at cost plus accrued income which equals market
value.  There were none at the end of fiscal 1994.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at cost, which does not exceed market.  The
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used for determining the cost of
approximately 89% of total inventories at July 3, 1994, 89% at June 27, 1993
and 90% at June 30, 1992.  The cost for the remaining portion of the inventories
was determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  If the FIFO
inventory valuation method had been used exclusively, inventories would have
been $42,268,000, $40,888,000 and $39,738,000 higher in the respective years.
The LIFO inventory adjustment was determined on an overall basis, and
accordingly, each class of inventory reflects an allocation based on the FIFO
amounts.

Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Plant and equipment is stated at cost, and
depreciation is computed using the straight-line method at rates based upon the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which significantly extend the
useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.
Upon retirement or disposition of plant and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is recognized in income.

Investment Tax Credits: The Company follows the deferral method of accounting
for the Federal investment tax credit.  The credit, which was eliminated in
1986, has been recorded as an addition to accumulated depreciation and is being
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets via a reduction
of depreciation expense.

The amounts amortized into income in each of the three years were $830,000 in
1994, $880,000 in 1993 and $1,030,000 in 1992.  At the end of fiscal years 1994
and 1993, unamortized deferred investment tax credits aggregated $3,225,000 and
$4,055,000, respectively.

                                                                       19

NOTES . . .
- - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Income Taxes: The Provision for Income Taxes includes Federal, state and
foreign income taxes currently payable and those deferred or prepaid because of
temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The Future Income Tax Benefits represent temporary differences
relating to current assets and current liabilities and the Deferred Income
Taxes represent temporary differences relating to noncurrent assets and
liabilities.

Research and Development Costs: Expenditures relating to the development of new
products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to
existing products, are expensed as incurred. The amounts charged against income
were $12,520,000 in 1994, $10,411,000 in 1993 and $10,808,000 in 1992.

Accrued Employee Benefits: The Company's life insurance program includes
payment of a death benefit to beneficiaries of retired employees. The Company
accrues for the estimated cost of these benefits over the estimated working 
life of the employee. Past service costs for all retired employees have been 
fully provided for and the Company also accrues for the estimated cost of 
supplemental retirement and death benefit agreements with executive officers.

Accrued Postretirement Health Care Obligation:  During the 1994 fiscal year,
the Company adopted the accounting prescribed in FAS 106 (Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions).  This change and the amounts associated with it
are more fully described in Note No. 9.

Foreign Currency Translation: Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are
translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at
fiscal year end. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates of
exchange in effect during the year. The related translation adjustments are
made directly to a separate component of shareholders' investment.

(2) INCOME TAXES:

The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands of
dollars):

At the beginning of fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standard (FAS) No. 109 which required a change in the recording of deferred
taxes.  The former method emphasized provisions which were made in the income
statement.  The emphasis in the new method is on the balance sheet and requires
that the amounts to be recorded are the amounts which will eventually be paid
out.  The adoption of this standard resulted in a cumulative adjustment which
was recorded as income totaling $8,346,000 or $.58 per share.

The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal
year were:

(6) GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS:

The Company is a 50% guarantor on bank loans of an unconsolidated Japanese
joint venture for the manufacture of engines.  These bank loans totaled
approximately $8,000,000 at the end of 1994 fiscal year.

The Company has forward foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase 6.9
billion Japanese yen for $68.5 million through June of 1995.  These contracts
are used to hedge the commitments to purchase engines from the Company's
Japanese joint venture.  The Company's European subsidiaries have forward
currency contracts to exchange 15.7 million German Marks for $10.0 million
through February of 1995.  The Company's Canadian subsidiary also has forward
contracts to exchange 4.4 million Canadian dollars for 3.2 million U.S. dollars
through June 1995.  These contracts are used to hedge intercompany inventory
purchases by these foreign subsidiaries.  Accordingly, any gain or loss on the
above contracts has been deferred at July 3, 1994.

The Company's Board of Directors approved the building of three new plants in
the United States.  It is anticipated that this project will total $112,000,000
and will be financed from operating cash flow and available lines of credit. As
of the date of this annual report, no sites had been decided upon and no
contracts had been signed.

The Company is also committed to the purchase of a foundry of which the total
cost is estimated to be $20,000,000.

The Company has no other material commitments for materials or capital
expenditures at July 3, 1994.


(7) STOCK OPTIONS:

In 1990, shareholders approved the Stock Incentive Plan under which 400,000
shares of the Company's common stock have been reserved for issuance. In fiscal
1994, shareholders approved an additional 1,250,000 shares for issuance under
the Stock Incentive Plan.

Options were granted in 1990 at $28.00 per share and will expire on February
19, 2000. Options were granted in 1991 at $31.25 per share and will expire on
February 18, 2001.

Of the options granted in 1992, 50% are exercisable on or after January 1,
1996, and the remainder are exercisable on or after January 1, 1997.  These
options will expire on May 17, 2002.  The options exercised in the fiscal year
1993 reflect an acceleration of exercise rights due to employee retirements and
were issued from treasury shares purchased on the open market.  None were
granted during fiscal 1993.  The options granted in 1994 will become
exercisable August 16, 1996 and expire August 16, 1998.  All options were
granted at a price equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date
of grant.


(8)  SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN:

On December 20, 1989, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution
of one common stock purchase right (a "right") for each share of the Company's
common stock outstanding on January 5, 1990.  Each right would entitle
shareowners to buy one-half of one share of the Company's common stock at an
exercise price of $85.00 per share, subject to adjustment.  The rights are not
currently exercisable, but would become exercisable if certain events occurred
relating to a person or group acquiring or attempting to acquire 20 percent or
more of the outstanding shares of common stock.  The rights expire on January
5, 2000, unless redeemed or exchanged by the Company earlier.

                                                                            23

NOTES ...
- - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the beginning of fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted two additional
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) as follows:

      FAS 106 - Postretirement Benefits Other   
        Than Pensions -

        This new standard requires that the Company record the expected cost of
        health care and life insurance benefits during the years that the
        employees render service - a significant change from the preceding
        method which recognized health care benefits on a cash basis. 
        Postretirement life insurance benefits were previously being accounted
        for in a manner substantially emulating the new standards, so no
        adjustment was necessary.  The cumulative effect of this change in
        accounting for postretirement health care benefits was a charge totaling
        $65,954,000 on a before tax basis or $40,232,000 on an after tax basis
        ($2.78 per share).  The additional annual cost of accruing this cost
        over the former method was approximately $2,000,000.

        For measurement purposes, a 10.5% annual rate of increase in the per
        capita cost of covered health care claims was assumed for the years 1995
        through 1997, decreasing gradually to 6% for the year 2007.  The health
        care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts
        reported.  The rates, if increased by 1%, would add $6,806,000 to the
        accumulated postretirement benefit and $849,000 to the service and
        interest cost for the year.

        The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
        benefit obligations was 7.75% compounded annually.  Both the health care
        and life insurance plans are unfunded.

        The components of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at
        the end of the 1994 fiscal year were (in thousands of dollars):

      FAS 112 - Postemployment Benefits -

        This new standard requires that the Company record the expected cost of
        postemployment benefits (not to be confused with the postretirement     
        benefits described in the preceding paragraphs), also over the years
        that employees render service. These benefits are substantially smaller
        amounts because they apply only to employees who permanently terminate
        employment prior to retirement. The cumulative effect of this change
        was a charge totaling $1,102,000 or $672,000 after taxes ($.05 per
        share). There will be no significant increase in the annual costs of
        these plans.

        The items included in this amount are disability payments, life
        insurance  and medical benefits, and these amounts are also discounted
        using a 7.75%  interest rate.

(10) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amount approximates fair value because
of the short maturity of those instruments.

Long-Term Debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated
based on quotations made on similar issues.

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows
(in thousands of dollars):

(11) RECAPITALIZATION:

In October, 1992, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Wisconsin. As
part of this reincorporation, each outstanding share of the old Delaware
Corporation $3.00 par value common stock was converted automatically to one
share of the new Wisconsin Corporation $.01 par value common stock. This change
resulted in the transfer of $43,246,000 from the common stock account to the
additional paid-in capital account.


(12) SPIN-OFF

The Company announced in May of 1994 that it intends to spin off the lock
business to its shareholders. This spin-off is expected to occur in early
calendar year 1995 and will be accomplished by creating a subsidiary corporation
which will hold all of the assets and liabilities of the lock business and then
immediately distributing the shares of this corporation to the Briggs & Stratton
Corporation shareholders as a tax-free dividend.

REPORT OF 
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
- - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders of
Briggs & Stratton Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Briggs &
Stratton Corporation (a Wisconsin Corporation) and subsidiaries as of July 3,
1994 and June 27, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended July 3, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Briggs & Stratton Corporation
and subsidiaries as of July 3, 1994 and June 27, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 3, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective at the beginning of the 1994 fiscal year, the Company changed its
methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions,
postemployment benefits and income taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
- - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993

Sales for fiscal 1994 increased 13% or $146,055,000 over fiscal 1993 and
totaled $1,285,517,000, a new record for the Company.  The major part of this
increase, which is in engine sales, is the result of three factors: a 5%
increase in engine units shipped; a modest increase in selling prices and a step
up to higher selling price engines in the same horsepower category; and a
continuance of the shift to higher horsepower, higher selling price engines. 
These improvements occurred in the domestic market because of the heavy demand
for lawn and garden equipment due primarily to favorable weather conditions and
housing starts.  Export sales increased between years despite weak economies
in Europe.  

Service sales increased 7% between years, primarily because of an increase in
demand for service parts.  Lock sales increased 20%, whereas lock unit sales
increased 13%.  This reflects a trend to higher unit price lock sets.  The 
increases in quantities are due to the growth in the U.S. car and truck 
industry.

The rate of gross profit increased from 19% in 1993 to 21% in 1994.  The
increase in total volume contributed to this improvement by spreading fixed
overhead over a larger number of engine units.  Increases in selling prices and
sales of higher profit margin engines also contributed to this change.  The
lack of the $8,408,000 additional depreciation recorded in fiscal 1993 also
contributed to the improvement between years.

Engineering, selling and general and administrative expenses increased
$11,619,000 or 14% between years.  Approximately one-half of this amount is due
to increased manpower costs which is primarily due to the increases in profit
sharing accruals.  The remaining increase is due to additional operating
expenses, primarily in the areas of professional services, advertising, and the
provision to the reserve for doubtful accounts.  

Interest expense is down $2,286,000 or 20% between years because of the lack of
any substantial amounts of domestic working capital loans during the year.  The
Company was able to finance virtually all of its midyear additional domestic
working capital needs through available cash.  Foreign loans also generated
less interest expense in 1994 due to a $7,294,000 reduction in average loans
outstanding and a nearly 2.4% decrease in average interest rates.  The end of
the year balance in foreign loans, however, reflected an increase of $5,400,000
used for working capital needs at the Company's European subsidiaries.

The Company has available $47,000,000 in domestic lines of credit plus an
additional $56,000,000 in seasonal lines, which it used only a short time in
midyear.  The Company makes extensive use of its foreign lines of credit
through its foreign subsidiaries.  Also during the year the Company was in
compliance with the covenants of the $75,000,000 long-term loan agreement.

Other income and expense changed from a net expense in 1993 to a net income in
1994.  The detail contents of this category are shown in Note 5.  The current
fiscal year did not include the $3,500,000 write-off of the cumulative
translation adjustment made in 1993.  Fiscal year 1994 did, however, contain a
gain on the sale of a subsidiary's real estate in conjunction with the change
in business in Germany in the previous fiscal year.  

The provision for income taxes was higher between years primarily because of
the increase in income.  The effective tax rate moved from  38.5% last year to
39.6% in 1994.  This was primarily due to a 1% increase in the U.S. statutory
rate.

The cumulative effect of the changes in accounting, which amounted to a net
$32,558,000 charge in the current year's statement of income, consists of
amounts that come from adopting three Financial Accounting Standards (Numbers
106, 109 and 112) during the year, and are fully described in Notes 2 and 9.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments increased $111,178,000 between
years as a result of retaining funds generated by profitable operations during
the year.  These funds and previously generated funds, along with the Company's
lines of credit, will provide the majority of the financing for the plant
expansions described in Note 6 and the normal higher working capital needs in
the middle of the 1995 fiscal year. 

Accounts receivable decreased $2,384,000 since the end of fiscal 1993.  This
was in spite of a $70,196,000 increase in sales in the fourth fiscal quarter of
1994 over the same period in 1993.   This improvement is due to a surge in
sales at the end of the previous year's fourth quarter.


                                                                            29

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION . . .
- - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inventories increased $11,605,000 between years - mostly in the finished goods
category.  The Company continued a high rate of production throughout the
fourth quarter and has extended it into the first quarter of the 1995 fiscal 
year.  This increase in finished engines will be used to fill the seasonal 
demand after the first fiscal quarter of 1995. 

Expenditures for plant and equipment totaled $40,804,000, an amount similar to
the expenditures in each of the preceding two years.  The 1995 fiscal year
will include expenditures for new plants described in Note 6 and therefore
will be substantially higher.  These expenditures will total approximately
$132,000,000, the majority of which could be spent in fiscal 1995.  As
described earlier, these expenditures are expected to be primarily internally
financed.

The Company and other parties have been issued an order by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that requires the cleanup of a site in the
State of Georgia near the site of the Company's former lock manufacturing
plant.  The work specified in the order will be completed by the end of the
1994 calendar year.  The Company has reserves totaling $4,202,000 to pay for
its cleanup.  In the opinion of management, this reserve is adequate to finance
the remaining costs of cleanup.

The EPA is developing national emission standards under a two phase process for
equipement powered by small air cooled gasoline engines.  It has recently
proposed phase one emission standards to be effective in August 1996.  The
California Air Resources Board previously adopted emission standards to be
effective in January 1995.  Changes to engine models that are necessary to
comply with these standards are being made or have been made.  The Company
believes that the costs associated with compliance with the standards will not 
have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of 
the Company.

Phase two of the EPA standards have not been established and it may be several
years before they are completed.  It is expected that they will be phased in
over several years and therefore it is impossible to quantify the cost of
compliance at this date.

Company management believes that the economic factors that contributed to the
strong demand in fiscal 1994 will continue into fiscal 1995.  Therefore, if the
weather cooperates in providing normal precipitation, the Company could benefit
from another year of strong demand for lawn and garden equipment during the
selling season.

In August 1994, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split
contingent on approval of an increase in the number of authorized common stock
shares to be voted on by the shareholders at their annual meeting on October
19, 1994.  The Board also stated its intent to increase the per share dividend
rate from $.23 per share to $.25 per share effective with the January 1995
payment on the split shares.

FISCAL 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1992

Sales increased $97,634,000 between fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1992.  This was a 9%
increase between years and was greater than the 3% increase in the number of
engines sold.  It reflected the continuing shift to higher horsepower, higher
selling price engines plus the realization of approximately a 2% price increase
between years.  Sales dollar increases occurred in export sales due to
favorable weather conditions and improved currency exchange rates.  Service
sales increased 7%.  Lock unit sales declined 1% between years.

Gross profit increased 22% between years.  This was due to an increase in the
gross profit rate from 17% in fiscal 1992 to 19% in 1993, and resulted from a
continuing reduction in operating costs, stable material costs and fixed costs
being spread over higher volume.  The 1993 fiscal year improvements were after
the Company absorbed $8,408,000 of additional depreciation on assets used to
produce discontinued engine models.

Engineering, selling and general and administrative expenses increased
$4,440,000 or 6% between years.  This increase reflected higher manpower costs
due to the additional profit sharing provision in the current fiscal year, and
increased operating costs of foreign subsidiaries in Canada, France and
Switzerland that were established at varying times in the current and preceding
fiscal years.  These new subsidiaries resulted in increased gross profit on
items sold by them.

Interest expense remained constant between years.  This reflected interest
savings on reduced domestic debt offset by higher interest expense on increased
foreign debt.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION . . .
- - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other income and expense remained relatively steady between years.  The 1993
fiscal year contained a $3,500,000 charge due to the recognition of the
cumulative translation adjustment relating to the Company's German subsidiary,
which changed business operations during the year from an engine and parts
distributor to a commissioned agent.

The provision for income taxes was higher between years primarily due to the
increase in income.  As income increases, the graduated state income tax rates
go up, and the effect of relatively fixed tax credits go down.  The write-down
of the German subsidiary investment described previously also raised the
income tax provision because of its nondeductibility for tax purposes.  The net
result of these changes was an increase in the effective income tax rate from
35.8% in 1992 to 38.5% in 1993.

Cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $30,981,000 between
years.  This resulted from the cash that was generated by profitable operations
in 1993.

The investment in accounts receivable increased $21,366,000 between years. 
This was due to the additional sales late in the last quarter of fiscal 1993.

Inventories showed no substantial change between fiscal years.  This reflects
stable inventory quantities and stable prices.

Current liabilities, excluding loans and notes payable, increased $13,731,000
between years.  This reflects a higher payroll accrual due to increased
employment at the end of 1993 and increases in accrued profit sharing paid out
early in fiscal 1994.  The increased payroll taxes on these items also
contributed to this increase.

Expenditures for plant and equipment totaled $38,110,000, a small decrease
between years.  There were no major projects included in these totals.

The Company's current ratio improved from 1.9 to 1 in 1992 to 2.2 to 1 in 1993. 
This increase continued the improvement in liquidity in the preceding four
years, and was also reflected in the steady increases in the cash and
equivalents and short-term investment amounts during those years.  The lines of
credit available to the Company were adequate to finance any of its seasonal
working capital needs.

During 1993, the Company changed its State of incorporation to Wisconsin, from
the State of Delaware.  As a part of this reincorporation, the par value of the
common stock was reduced from $3.00 per share to $.01 per share.  This
transaction resulted in a new shareholder investment account called Additional
Paid-In Capital.  This new account is analyzed in the financial statements.
