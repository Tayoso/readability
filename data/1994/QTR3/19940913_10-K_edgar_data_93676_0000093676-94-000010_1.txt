PART I


Item I - Business

The Company was founded in 1880 and incorporated in 1929 and is engaged in the
business of manufacturing industrial, professional, and consumer products.  The
total number of different items made and sold by the Company exceeds 5,000. 
Among the items produced are precision tools, tape measures, levels, electronic
gages, dial indicators, gage blocks, digital readout measuring tools, granite
surface plates, optical measuring projectors, coordinate measuring machines,
vises, M1 lubricant, hacksaw blades, hole saws, band saw blades, jigsaw blades,
reciprocating saw blades, and precision ground flat stock.  Much of the
Company's production is concentrated in hand measuring tools (such as
micrometers, steel rules, combination squares and many other items for the
individual craftsman) and precision instruments (such as vernier calipers,
height gages, depth gages and measuring instruments that manufacturing
companies buy for the use of their employees).

These tools and instruments are sold throughout the United States and Canada
and over 100 foreign countries, primarily through distributors.  By far the
largest consumer of these products is the metalworking industry, but other
important consumers are automotive, aviation, marine and farm equipment shops,
do-it-yourselfers and tradesmen such as builders, carpenters, plumbers and
electricians. One retailer, Sears, accounts for approximately 11% of the
Company's sales.

Most of the Company's products are made from steel purchased from steel mills. 
Forgings, castings, and a few small finished parts are purchased from other
manufacturers.  Raw materials have always been readily available to the
Company.

At June 25, 1994, the Company had 2,563 employees.

The Company is one of the largest producers of mechanics' hand measuring tools
and precision instruments.  In the United States, there are three other major
companies and numerous small competitors in the field, with the result that the
industry is highly competitive.  During the fiscal year ended June 25, 1994,
there were no material changes in the Company's competitive position.  During
recent years, changes in the volume of sales of the Company have, in general,
corresponded with changes throughout the industry.  In saws and precision
ground flat stock, the Company in the United States competes with many
manufacturers.  The Company competes principally through the high quality of
its products and the service it provides its customers.

In recent years, direct foreign competition has affected the Company's domestic
business to a limited extent.

Sales order backlog of the Company at any point in time is negligible.

The operations of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are consolidated in its
financial statements.  The subsidiaries located in Brazil and Scotland are
actively engaged in the manufacture of hacksaw and band saw blades and a
limited line of precision tools and measuring tapes.  The Company expects its
foreign subsidiaries to continue to play a significant role in its overall
operations. A summary of the Company's foreign operations is contained in the

                                   -2-
<PAGE>
footnotes to the Company's 1994 financial statements found in item 8 of this
Form 10K and is hereby incorporated by reference.

The Company generally fills orders from finished goods inventories on hand;
total inventories amounted to approximately $53,165,000 at June 25, 1994, and
$53,567,000 at June 26, 1993.  The Company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method of valuing most inventories, which results in more realistic operating
costs and profits.  Inventory amounts are approximately $25,391,000 and
$25,757,000 lower, respectively, than if determined on a first-in, first-out
(FIFO) basis.

The Company does apply for patent protection on new inventions and presently
owns a number of patents.  Its patents are considered important in the
operation of the business, but no single patent is of material importance when
viewed from the standpoint of its overall business.  The Company relies on its
continuing product research and development efforts, with less dependence on
its present patent position.  It has for many years maintained engineers and
supporting personnel engaged in research, product development, and related
activities.  The expenditures for these activities during fiscal years 1994,
1993 and 1992 were approximately $2,718,000, $3,122,000 and $3,662,000,
respectively, all of which was expensed in the Company's financial statements.

The Company uses trademarks with respect to its products.  All of its important
trademarks are registered.

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or
adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise
relating to protection of the environment is not expected to have a material
effect on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the
Company.

The business of the Company is to some extent seasonal, with sales and earnings
generally at the lowest level during the first quarter of the fiscal year.

Item 2 - Properties

The Company's principal plant is located in Athol, Massachusetts, on about 15
acres of Company-owned land.  The plant consists of 25 buildings, mostly of
brick construction of varying dates, with approximately 535,000 square feet of
production and storage area.

The Webber Gage Division, Cleveland, Ohio, owns and occupies two buildings
containing approximately 46,000 square feet.

The Company-owned facility in Mt. Airy, North Carolina has approximately
219,000 square feet. It is occupied by the Company's Saw Division, Granite
Surface Plate Division, Coordinate Measuring Machine Division, Optical
Comparator Division, Ground Flat Stock Division and Vise Division.  This plant
is subject to a mortgage collateralizing a $3,900,000 Industrial Revenue Bond.

The Company's Advanced Technology Division, located in Gardner, Massachusetts,
occupies about 8,000 square feet of leased facilities.

The Company's Evans Rule Division, located in North Charleston, South Carolina,
owns and occupies a 136,000 square foot building.  In addition, this division
leases 32,000 square feet of manufacturing space located in Mayaguez, Puerto
Rico.

                                   -3-
<PAGE>
The Company's Level Division is located in Alum Bank, Pennsylvania and owns and
occupies a 50,000 square foot building.

The Company's Brazil subsidiary is located in a 140,000 square foot building. 
The Company's Scotland subsidiary occupies a 187,000 square foot building and
also leases approximately 16,000 square feet of manufacturing space in Skipton,
England, where its wholly owned subsidiary manufactures optical measuring
projectors.  A subsidiary in Mississauga, Canada occupies a 25,000 square foot
building.  With the exception of Skipton, these facilities are all owned.

In addition, the Company owns and operates warehouses/sales offices in Atlanta,
Georgia; Buena Park, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; and Farmington Hills,
Michigan. The Company's two granite quarries in North Carolina were sold in
fiscal 1994.

In its opinion, all of the Company's property, plant and equipment is in good
operating condition, well maintained and adequate for its needs.

Item 3 - Legal Proceedings

The Company is not involved in any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4 - Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended June 25, 1994.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

Item 5 - Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related
         Stockholder Matters                                  

The Company's Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Quarterly dividend and high/low closing market price information is presented
in the table below. The Registrant's Class B common stock is generally
nontransferable, except to lineal descendants and thus has no established
trading market, but it can be converted into Class A common stock at any time. 
The Class B common stock was issued on October 5, 1988, and the Registrant has
paid the same dividends thereon as have been paid on the Class A common stock
since that date.  At July 22, 1994, there were 2,713 registered holders of
Class A common stock and 2,321 registered holders of Class B common stock.

Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations                                  


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales

Sales are up 3% compared to a year ago.  This follows a 3% decrease in 1993. 
The current year increase is all domestic, with the weakening pound in Scotland
during the early part of the year and lower volume in Brazil holding foreign
sales flat.  The sales decline in 1993 was among all divisions and generally
a result of worldwide economic conditions as well as the drop in the pound.

Earnings Before Taxes

Pretax earnings are down 9% for the year.  This includes a 18% increase in
domestic pretax earnings as a result of increased sales.  The foreign decline
is almost all in Brazil where price competition has been intense.  In addition,
realized and unrealized exchange losses in Brazil, which are included in other
income and expense, are up over $1 million as a result of the extremely high
inflation during the year.  The 20% drop in pretax earnings in 1993 was
primarily the result of a decrease in domestic margins because of lower volume
as well as one-time expenses associated with the move of our Saw Division to
Mt. Airy, N.C. 

Net Earnings

The current year net earnings trend is the opposite of the pretax trend, with
1994 improving 3% over 1993.  The effective tax rate is only 17% in 1994
compared to 26% in 1993 and 30% in 1992 (a more normal year).  Tax-exempt
interest, Puerto Rico tax incentives and dividends on ESOP stock always
contribute to an overall effective tax rate that is slightly lower than the
normal U.S. statutory rate of 34%.  The decline of the effective tax rate in
1994, however, comes from the favorable tax treatment of a fourth quarter
dividend from Scotland and also from Brazil, where two things happened.  Higher
than usual inflation in Brazil resulted in large tax deductions for so-called
monetary correction (an accounting concept unique to Brazil), about doubling
the expected tax benefit.  In addition, there was a favorable partial

                                   -5-
<PAGE>
resolution ($350,000) to a tax dispute we have been having with the government
since 1991.

The 1993 versus 1992 reduction in rate relates to: 1) domestic income mix
favoring Puerto Rico, where the effective tax rate is lower and 2) the
favorable tax treatment of a third quarter dividend from Scotland.

Accounting Changes

The Company adopted both FAS 106 (retiree medical benefits) and FAS 109 (income
taxes) in fiscal 1992, recording the cumulative effect in the first quarter of
1992.  The cumulative effect of the income tax change comes from recording the
deferred taxes associated with a 1987 acquisition.  The cumulative effect of
the retiree medical benefit change relates to benefits earned for past service.

In fiscal 1995, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial Standards No.
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which
will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position with a working
capital ratio of 5.8 to one on June 25, 1994 as well as June 26, 1993. Cash and
short-term investments are up over $3 million compared to June 1993. This
resulted from being able to hold receivables and inventory even despite
increasing sales, along with lower than average fixed asset additions.

The fact that the changes in receivables and payables in the Statement of Cash
Flows do not exactly match the changes in the related balance sheet accounts
is because of changes in foreign exchange rates. These differences should not
be interpreted as uses and sources of cash, but rather as noncash adjustments
to net income to arrive at cash generated from operations. Also, in Brazil,
these differences tend to be offset by unrealized exchange gains and losses.

Borrowings under the Company's $20 million revolving credit agreement have been
used to finance acquisitions. The Company believes that existing cash balances,
funds generated from operations and available funds under its credit line will
be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs. Cash not immediately required for
working capital needs is invested in short-term government securities and other
money market investments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Stockholders and Directors of
The L.S. Starrett Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The L.S.
Starrett Company and subsidiaries as of June 25, 1994 and June 26, 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows, and
stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 25,
1994. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in item
14(a)2 of this Form 10K. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as
of June 25, 1994 and June 26, 1993, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 25, 1994,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the Accounting Changes note to the consolidated financial
statements, in 1992 the Company changed its methods of accounting for income
taxes and postretirement benefits other than pensions.

                         THE L. S. STARRETT COMPANY
                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
  accounts of The L.S.Starrett Company and subsidiaries, all of which are
  wholly-owned. All significant intercompany items have been eliminated. The
  fiscal years of the Company's subsidiaries in Scotland and Brazil end in May
  and April, respectively.

Fair market value of financial instruments: The Company's financial instruments
  consist primarily of current assets, current liabilities, and long-term debt. 
  Current assets, except inventory (see Inventories), and current liabilities
  are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value; long-term debts,
  which are at current market interest rates, also approximate fair market
  value.

Short-term investments: Short-term investments, carried at cost, which
  approximates market, consist primarily of marketable securities, including
  treasury bills, certificates of deposit, municipal securities and money
  market preferreds.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  For
  approximately 80% of all inventories, cost is determined on a last-in, first-
  out (LIFO) basis.  For all other inventories, cost is determined on a first-
  in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  LIFO inventories are $39,984,000 and $38,383,000
  at the end of 1994 and 1993, respectively, such amounts being $25,391,000 and
  $25,757,000 less than if determined on a FIFO basis.  During 1994, 1993 and
  1992, the Company reduced the level of certain LIFO inventories that were
  carried at significantly lower costs prevailing in prior years.  The effect
  of the LIFO inventory reduction was to increase net earnings approximately
  $443,000 in 1994 ($.06 per share), $1,420,000 in 1993 ($.20 per share) and
  $825,000 in 1992 ($.12 per share).

  Total inventories at year end are as follows (in thousands):

                            Goods in Pro-                                  
                              cess and       Raw Materials                 
          Finished Goods   Finished Parts    and Supplies         Total    
    1994     $23,530          $16,111          $13,524          $53,165    
    1993      21,324           19,189           13,054           53,567    

Income taxes: Deferred tax expense results from differences in the timing of
  certain transactions for financial reporting and tax purposes.  Deferred
  taxes have not been recorded on undistributed earnings of foreign
  subsidiaries (approximately $45,000,000 at June 1994) or the related
  unrealized translation adjustments because such amounts are considered
  permanently invested and, if remitted, the resulting taxes would be offset
  by foreign tax credits.

Property, plant and equipment: Buildings and equipment are depreciated using
  straight-line and accelerated methods over estimated useful lives as follows:
  buildings 15 to 50 years, building improvements 10 to 20 years, machinery and
  equipment 5 to 12 years, motor vehicles 3 to 5 years.

Cost in excess of net assets acquired: These costs are being amortized on a 
  straight-line basis over 10 to 40 years.

                                   -11-
<PAGE>
Research and development: Research and development costs are $2,718,000 in 
  1994, $3,122,000 in 1993 and $3,662,000 in 1992.

Earnings per share: Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average
  number of shares and common stock equivalents (stock options) outstanding
  during the year.

Translation of foreign currencies: Assets and liabilities in nonhyperinfla-
  tionary economies are translated at exchange rates in effect on reporting
  dates, and income and expenses are translated at rates in effect on
  transaction dates.  The resulting differences due to changing exchange rates
  are charged or credited directly to the "foreign currency translation
  adjustment" account included as part of stockholders' equity.  For the
  Company's subsidiary in Brazil ( a hyperinflationary economy), the
  translation method is the same except that inventories and plant and the
  related charges to cost of sales and depreciation expense are translated at
  rates in effect at the time the assets were purchased, and the resulting
  translation gains and losses are included in the determination of net
  earnings.  Translation gains and losses on short-term borrowings and
  marketable securities in Brazil are netted against the related interest
  charged or income earned.  Similar losses on accounts receivable are treated
  as sales discounts and are netted against sales.



ACCOUNTING CHANGES
In fiscal 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 (FAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes, and FAS 106, Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.

The effect of adopting FAS 109 was to increase net earnings $56,000 ($0.01 per
share) in 1992, which included a negative cumulative effect on prior years of
$251,000 ($0.04 per share) resulting primarily from the effect of a 1987
acquisition.

The effect of adopting FAS 106 was to decrease net earnings $7,623,000 ($1.10
per share) in 1992, which included the cumulative effect on prior years of
$7,478,000 ($1.08 per share), and is net of a $4,985,000 tax benefit.  FAS 106
requires companies to recognize the future cost of postretirement medical and
other nonpension benefits on an accrual basis during an employee's service in
a manner similar to the present accounting method for pension costs.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has several pension plans, both defined benefit and defined
contribution, covering all of its domestic and approximately half of its
nondomestic employees. In addition, certain domestic employees participate in
an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  Ninety percent of the actuarially
determined annuity value of their ESOP shares is used to offset retirement
benefits otherwise due under the domestic noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan.  The total cost (benefit) of all such plans for 1994, 1993 and
1992, considering the combined projected benefits and funds of the ESOP as well
as the pension plans, was $(124,000), $240,000 and $257,000, respectively.

                                   -13-
<PAGE>
Under both domestic and foreign defined benefit plans, benefits are based on
years of service and final average earnings.  Plan assets, including those of
the ESOP, consist primarily of investment grade debt obligations, marketable
equity securities and approximately 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common
stock.  The cost of these defined benefit plans, including the ESOP, consists
of the following components (in thousands):
                                                   1994     1993     1992

  Prepaid pension cost                           $14,897  $12,870  $11,356 

The assumed discount rate and rate of increase in compensation used in
determining the projected benefit obligation are 7% and 5%, respectively, for
the domestic plan and 8% and 6.5% for the foreign plan. The assumed long-term
rate of return on plan assets is 7% for the domestic plan and 8% for the
foreign plan.

The Company provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for most
retired employees in the United States. See Accounting Changes note regarding
the adoption of FAS 106 in fiscal 1992.

The status of these plans at year end is as follows (in thousands):
                                                            1994     1993

Postretirement benefit expense consists of the following (in thousands):

                                                   1994     1993     1992

The Company's portion of the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered benefits is assumed to be 2%. A one percentage point increase in the
assumed cost escalation rate would increase the accumulated benefit obligation
by $1.2 million and the annual expense by $150,000. A discount rate of 7% was
used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation.

LONG-TERM DEBT
At year end, long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):

                                                            1994     1993

                                                           11,443   15,127

The industrial revenue bond is collateralized by the Company's plant in Mt.
Airy, North Carolina. Principal is payable in semiannual installments of
$300,000.  Interest is at 92% of the 90 day CD rate (3.3% at June 25, 1994). 
Interest on the ESOP guaranteed loan is at LIBOR plus 1/2% (4.6% at June 25,
1994).  The ESOP guaranteed loan was used to purchase 800,000 shares of Company
stock under a ten-year bank term loan that was guaranteed by the Company. 
Dividends and Company contributions to the ESOP are used to repay the term
loan, and the shares sold to the ESOP are being allocated to employee accounts
at the rate of 10% per year.  Additional contributions are made to replace the
dividends used for debt service.  The revolving credit agreement is for
$20,000,000 with two banks and requires commitment and other fees of .3%.
Interest rates vary, but approximate LIBOR plus 3/8% (4.8% as of June 25,
1994).  Borrowings are payable in 16 equal quarterly installments commencing
December 1995.  All debt agreements contain financial covenants, the most
restrictive of which is that at June 25, 1994 the Company must have tangible
net worth of $124,000,000.  Annual principal payments on debt (excluding ESOP)
are required as follows: 1995 $600,000, 1996 $1,913,000, 1997-1999 $2,350,000,
thereafter $1,337,000.



COMMON STOCK
Class B Common Stock is identical to Class A except that it has 10 votes per
share, is generally nontransferable except to lineal descendants, cannot
receive more dividends than Class A, and can be converted to Class A at any
time.  Class A Common Stock is entitled to elect 25% of the directors to be
elected at each meeting with the remaining 75% being elected by Class A and
Class B voting together.  In addition, the Company has a stockholder rights
plan, adopted in 1990, to protect stockholders from attempts to acquire the
Company on unfavorable terms not approved by the Board of Directors.  Under
certain circumstances, the plan entitles each Class A or Class B share to
additional shares of the Company or an acquiring company, as defined, at a 50%
discount to market.  Generally, the rights will be exercisable if a person or
group acquires 15% or more of the Company's outstanding shares.  The rights
trade together with the underlying common stock.  They can be redeemed by the
Company for $.01 per right and expire in the year 2000.

Under the Company's stock purchase plans, the purchase price of the optioned
stock is 85% of the lower of the market price on the date the option is granted
or the date it is exercised.  Options become exercisable exactly two years from
the date of grant and expire if not exercised.  The average purchase price of
the optioned stock outstanding at the end of 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $20.33,
$20.66 and $18.11, respectively.  Changes in optioned and unoptioned shares
under the plans were as follows:

Operating income is computed exclusive of other income and expense and income
taxes. Transfers are recorded at normal selling price for finished goods and
at cost plus a percentage to cover expenses for finished parts, work in process
and raw materials. Eliminations relate to investments in subsidiaries and
intercompany transactions and balances.

The Company believes it has no significant concentrations of credit risk as of
June 25, 1994. Trade receivables are disbursed among a large number of
retailers, distributors and industrial accounts in many countries. One customer
accounted for approximately 11% of sales in 1994 and 10% in 1993.

The significant foreign operations of the Company are located in Scotland and
Brazil. These two locations accounted for approximately the following
percentages of the indicated foreign information listed above:
