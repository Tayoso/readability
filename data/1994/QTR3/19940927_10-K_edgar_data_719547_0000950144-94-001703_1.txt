ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

Clayton Homes, Inc. (Company) produces, sells,  finances and insures primarily
low to medium priced manufactured homes.  The Company's 13 manufacturing plants
produce homes which are marketed in 26 states through 583 retail dealers, 165
of which are  company-owned sales centers.  The Company provides installment
financing to purchasers of manufactured homes sold by its retail centers and by
selected independent dealers.  Such financing is provided through its
wholly-owned finance subsidiary.  The Company acts as agent and earns
commissions on physical damage and credit life insurance written for retail
purchasers of manufactured homes sold by the Company and  reinsures risks on
physical damage and credit life  insurance policies issued by a non-related
insurance company (ceding company) in connection with the Company's retail
sales.  The Company also develops, owns, and manages manufactured housing
communities.

The Company is a Tennessee corporation whose predecessor was incorporated in
1968 in Tennessee.  It's principal executive offices are located in Knoxville,
Tennessee.

The following table shows the percentage of revenue derived from sales by
company-owned retail centers, sales to independent dealers and financial
services operations and other income for each of the last three fiscal years.

For information relating to the Company's three major business segments, see
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report
to Shareholders.

Company sales reflect the seasonality of the manufactured housing industry.  In
recent years, approximately 32% of the Company's sales have occurred in its
fourth quarter ended June 30.

MANUFACTURED HOMES

A manufactured home made by the Company is a factory-built, completely finished
dwelling.  Constructed to be transported by trucks, the home is mounted on
wheels attached to its chassis.  Manufactured homes are designed as permanent,
primary residences when sited and attached to utilities.

The Company manufactures more than 150 models of single and multi-section homes
in a wide price range.  Retail prices range from $13,000 to $75,000 with sizes
from 675 square feet to 2,100 square feet.

The Company markets homes under a variety of model names.  Homes include as
standard equipment central heating, range, refrigerator, complete bathroom,
water heater, carpeting and draperies.  Options offered include central air
conditioning, woodburning fireplace, bay windows, hardwood floors, vinyl siding
and furniture.





                                       2

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

The Company owns or leases 13 manufacturing plants, ranging in size from
53,000 to 226,000 square feet.  Plants are located in Ardmore, two in Bean
Station, Halls, Maynardville, Rutledge and Savannah, Tennessee; in Henderson,
Oxford and Richfield, North Carolina; Waycross, Georgia and two in Waco, Texas.
See "Properties (item 2)."  The Company's manufactured homes are built in its
plants using assembly-line techniques.  Completion of a home ordinarily takes
two days.   Homes are generally produced only against orders received from
independent dealers and company-owned retail centers; therefore the Company
does not normally maintain a significant inventory of homes at its plants.
Completed homes are transported to the retail centers by independent carriers.

The Company's plants operate on a one-shift-per-day basis, normally for a
five-day week, with the capacity to produce approximately 30,000 floor sections
per year.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the Company produced
21,973 floor sections.

The principal materials utilized in the production of the Company's homes are
steel, aluminum, wood, fiberglass, carpet, vinyl floor covering, hardware
items, appliances and electrical items.  The Company purchases, among other
things, undercarriages, steel for the frames, appliances, plumbing fixtures,
furniture, windows and doors.  The Company uses a number of supply sources, and
it believes that the materials and parts necessary for the construction and
assembly of its homes will remain readily available from these sources.  In the
event that any of these items are not readily available or are available at a
higher cost than could be passed on to consumers, the operations of the Company
could be materially adversely affected.

The Company offers a one-year, limited warranty covering manufacturing defects
in materials or workmanship in a home.  Warranties covering appliances and
equipment installed in the homes generally are obligations of the manufacturers
of such items and not those of the Company.  Warranty and service costs during
the years ended June 30, 1994, and June 30, 1993, amounted to approximately
$7,510,000 and $5,224,000, respectively.

The backlog of firm orders for homes manufactured by the Company's
Manufacturing Group, including orders from company-owned retail centers, was
approximately $42,300,000 and $42,400,000 on June 30, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.  Based on the Company's current production rate, approximately
six  weeks would be required to fill backlog orders at June 30, 1994.

</TABLE>                                                  

INDEPENDENT DEALERS

In the years ended June 30, 1994, and 1993, approximately 57% and 53%,
respectively, of homes manufactured by the Company were sold to its independent
dealers.  As of June 30, 1994, the Company had 372 independent dealers in 25
states.  The Company believes that its independent dealer network enables it to
distribute homes to more markets and more quickly without as large an
investment in management resources and overhead expense as is required with
company-owned retail centers.  Sales to independent dealers also help the
Company ensure that its homes are competitive with other manufacturers in terms
of consumer acceptability, product design, quality and price.





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
The Company generally does not assist independent dealers in arranging
financing for their retail customers. However, the Company's finance
subsidiary, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc. (VMF), may provide financing
for retail customers of selected independent dealer locations with  terms and
conditions similar to those provided to company-owned dealerships.  Because
independent dealers have their own source of inventory financing, the Company
typically  receives payment for homes within two weeks of delivery to the
independent dealer.

The Company establishes relationships with independent dealers through sales
representatives from its manufacturing plants.  These representatives visit
independent dealers in assigned areas to solicit orders for the Company's
homes.  The area is generally limited to a 400 to 500 mile radius from each of
the Company's manufacturing plants due to the relatively significant cost of
transporting a home. Depending on the cost of the home and the wholesale
competition within the area,  a home may be competitively shipped shorter or
longer distances.  During each of the last three fiscal years no dealer
accounted for more than 2% of the Company's consolidated revenues.

The Company has no written agreements with its independent dealers, and the
relationship between the Company and each of its independent dealers may be
terminated at any time by either party.  The  Company believes its relations
with independent dealers are good, and has experienced relatively little
turnover among independent dealers in the past five years.  The Company
generally has no control over the operations of  independent dealers.

Typically the Company  neither provides inventory financing arrangements for
independent dealer purchases nor consigns homes.  As is customary in the
industry, lenders financing independent dealer purchases require that the
Company execute repurchase agreements which provide that, in the event of
dealer default under the dealer's inventory financing arrangements, the Company
will repurchase homes for the amount remaining unpaid to the lender, excluding
interest and repossession costs.  Historically, any homes repurchased under
such agreements have been resold to other dealers, including company-owned
retail centers, at no less than the repurchase price.  During the last five
fiscal years, the Company has incurred no significant loss resulting from these
contingent obligations, but there can be no assurance that losses will not
occur in the future.

COMPANY RETAIL OPERATIONS

As of June 30, 1994, the Company sold homes through 165 company-owned retail
centers in 15 states.  In addition to selling homes built by the Company,
virtually all of these retail centers sell new homes manufactured by other
companies and previously owned manufactured homes.

The following table indicates the number of company-owned retail centers and
certain information relating to homes they sold during the last three fiscal
years.

  Number of previously-owned homes sold......    2,523      2,126      2,076
</TABLE>


All of the company-owned retail centers employ salespeople who are primarily
compensated on a commission basis.  The retail centers do not have
administrative staffs since most administrative functions are performed at the
Company's corporate headquarters.

To provide customers a wider price range of homes, the Company purchases
previously-owned homes  from individuals and from other dealers, as well as
repossessed homes from lenders throughout its trade territory.

Homes sold by company-owned retail centers are delivered to the home owner's
site by trucks either owned by the Company or leased for the particular
delivery.  The purchase price of the home includes delivery to the retail
purchaser's site.  The Company's service personnel are responsible for siting
the home and connecting all utilities available at the time, except the
electrical, water  and gas connections, which are done by licensed technicians
at the home owner's expense.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

The Company believes the ability to make financing available to retail
purchasers is a materially important factor affecting the market acceptance of
its product.  The Company facilitates retail sales by making loans through its
finance subsidiary, VMF, and by maintaining relationships with conventional
lenders such as banks, finance companies and insurance companies for the
pre-arranged sale of retail installment contracts.  The following table
reflects the relative percentages of homes sold by the Company's retail centers
which were financed through the Company, either by VMF or by conventional
lenders, and those sales made to customers who arranged their own financing or
paid cash.

</TABLE>

VMF also purchases and originates manufactured housing installment contract
receivables (also referred to as manufactured housing contracts) on an
individual basis from dealers not owned by the Company.  Such dealers must make
an application to VMF for dealer approval.  Upon satisfactory results of VMF's
investigation of the dealer's creditworthiness and general business reputation,
VMF and the dealer enter into a dealer agreement.

In addition to purchasing manufactured housing contracts from company-owned and
independent dealers on an individual basis, VMF makes bulk purchases of
manufactured housing contracts. It also performs, on behalf of other
institutions, servicing of manufactured housing contracts that were not
originally purchased or originated by VMF.  These purchases  and servicing
arrangements may relate to the portfolios of other lenders or finance
companies,  governmental agencies or instrumentalities, or other entities that
purchase and hold manufactured housing contracts.

VMF is actively seeking arrangements by which it would service manufactured
housing contracts originated by other lenders.  VMF currently anticipates that
it will only seek servicing responsibilities which relate to manufactured
housing contracts.

UNDERWRITING POLICIES.  Retail customers of the Company who express a desire to
obtain financing by or through the Company complete a credit application form
which is initially reviewed  by the manager of the company-owned  retail
center.  The manager then forwards the application to VMF or another source of
financing.

Credit applications are then evaluated by VMF credit managers.  VMF's
underwriting guidelines generally require that each applicant's credit history,
residence history, employment history and income to debt payment ratios be
examined.  There are no requirements on the basis of which, if met, credit is
routinely approved; or if they are not met, credit is routinely denied.  If in
the judgment of the VMF credit manager an applicant does not meet minimum
underwriting criteria, there generally must be compensating higher ratings with
respect to other criteria in order for an applicant to be approved.  Credit
managers must confirm that the credit investigation gave a complete and
up-to-date accounting of the applicant's creditworthiness.  Credit managers are
encouraged to obtain second opinions on loans for relatively larger dollar
amounts or those which in their judgment, tend to rank lower in terms of
underwriting criteria.  Generally, the sum of the monthly obligation for
installment obligations, including the manufactured loan payment and monthly
site costs, should not exceed 40% of the applicant's gross monthly income.

With respect to those customers determined to be credit worthy, VMF requires a
down payment in the form of cash, the trade-in value of a previously owned
manufactured home, and/or the estimated value of equity in real property
pledged as additional collateral.  For previously- owned homes, the trade-in
allowance accepted by the dealer must be consistent with the value of the home
as determined by VMF in light of current market conditions.  The value of real
property pledged as additional collateral is estimated by personnel of the
dealer, who are not appraisers but are familiar with the area in which the
property is located.  The minimum amount of the down payment is 5% of the
purchase price.  The purchase price includes the stated cash sale price of the
manufactured home, sales or other taxes and fees, set-up costs and certain
insurance premiums (including up to five years of premiums on required hazard
insurance).  The balance of the purchase price is financed by an installment
sales

contract providing for a purchase money security interest in the manufactured
home and a mortgage on any real property pledged as additional collateral.
Normally, the contracts provide for equal monthly payments, generally over a
period of five to fifteen years at fixed rates of interest.  VMF's installment
contracts may provide for either fixed rates or adjustable rates of interest.
VMF believes the typical manufactured home purchaser is primarily sensitive to
the amount of the monthly payment, and not to the interest rate.

VMF has developed financing options such as contracts with a seven-year term
(compared to the industry norm of 15 to 20 years) which provide financing to
its customers at a relatively lower cost.  In January 1990, the Company
introduced a bi-weekly payment contract which provides for 26 payments a year
which are made by electronically drafting the purchaser's checking account.
The Company believes that such financing options are attractive to the customer
and improve market acceptance of its homes as well as improve its delinquency
and repossession experience.

During the last seven fiscal years, VMF has become the most significant source
of financing for purchasers of the Company's homes.  In fiscal 1988, VMF
originated 5,692 contracts and in fiscal 1994, VMF originated 12,401 contracts.
At June 30, 1994, VMF was servicing approximately 88,000 contracts with an
aggregate dollar amount of $1,316 million of which VMF has ownership interest
or contingent liability on approximately 60,200 contracts with an aggregate
dollar amount of $1,013 million.  The Company expects that VMF will continue to
originate a significant portion of the financing for purchasers of its homes.

VMF FUNDING.  VMF draws on its short-term credit facilities with the Company to
fund manufactured home loans made to retail customers of the Company and
selected independent dealers.  After short-term warehousing, VMF transfers or
pledges these loans, generally in pools, to institutional investors or
long-term lenders.

VMF maintains long-term committed credit facilities and other arrangements or
relationships with institutional investors.  It acts as a permanent lender on
certain conventional loans in that it holds these loans as long-term
receivables, pledging them as collateral for borrowings.  VMF also permanently
funds conventional loans by pooling them for sale to institutional investors.
Proceeds of both sources of funding are used to repay short-term borrowings.
VMF retains servicing in both cases.





                                       6
<PAGE>   7
Loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the
Veterans Administration (VA) are permanently funded through the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pass-through program.  Under the GNMA
program, installment sales contracts that are either insured by the FHA or
guaranteed by the VA are warehoused by VMF and then pooled in denominations of
approximately $1,000,000 to collateralize the issuance by VMF of securities
guaranteed by GNMA under the provisions of the National Housing Act.  Under the
GNMA program, VMF retains the servicing of the installment sales contracts and
is responsible for passing through payments under the contracts to GNMA
security holders.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, VMF originated
installment sales contracts eligible for financing under the GNMA program
having aggregate principal balances of $19 million.  As of June 30, 1994, VMF
was servicing 221 GNMA pools totaling $148 million in principal balances.  Use
of GNMA financing minimizes the Company's contingent liability for these
installment sales contracts because of the government-insured nature of the
loans.  Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this form of
financing, for customers who qualify, enables increases in the marketability of
its manufactured homes.

Certain of the agreements related to borrowings include covenants with respect
to the Company's financial condition, corporate existence and employment of
certain key individuals. The Company may remain contingently liable on
installment sales contracts sold with recourse to institutional investors; this
contingent liability amounted to approximately $63 million as of June 30, 1994.
See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual
Report to Shareholders.

The interest rates on approximately 98% of the long-term credit facilities or
the pass-through certificates representing ownership of the pools are fixed or
have adjustable rates with ceilings, while the remaining 2% have variable rates
which provide for no minimum or maximum rate of interest.  VMF attempts to
match liabilities and assets as to both term and rate. This reduces loss
exposure from interest rate fluctuations.  VMF uses a number of techniques to
achieve this result, principally by pricing its fixed rate receivables at or
above the maximum rate allowed under such arrangements.  When loans are funded
under arrangements which do not have a maximum rate, the Company attempts to
price these loans at or above forecasted interest rates.  The Company minimizes
the use of credit facilities which do not carry a maximum rate.

The Company believes that, as long as buyers of the Company's homes remain
sensitive primarily to the amount of their monthly payments rather than
interest rates and VMF is able to continue to implement its loan practice and
pricing policies, a change in interest rates will not have a material effect on
its business.  There can be no assurance, however, that a significant change in
interest rates will not have a material effect on the Company's business and
financial condition.  Generally, the Company's and VMF's existing borrowing
arrangements do not provide for interest rate hedging.

ACQUIRED CONTRACTS AND SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS.  The Acquired Contracts were
originated by savings and loan associations or savings banks and acquired
indirectly or directly from them by VMF.  The Acquired Contracts were
underwritten on the basis of underwriting criteria that were different from
and, as a whole, not as strict as VMF's underwriting criteria.

In fiscal 1992, VMF became the servicer of 15,409 manufactured homes
installment sales contracts with an approximate principal balance of $199
million acquired by a REMIC trust from the Resolution Trust Corporation.  VMF
is acting solely as servicer with respect to these contracts and, thus, has no
ownership interest nor contingent liability related to this portfolio.  At June
30, 1994, VMF was servicing approximately 27,000 of these installment sales
contracts with an approximate principal balance of $303 million.

DELINQUENCY AND REPOSSESSION EXPERIENCE.  VMF performs recordkeeping and
collection activities on all loans that it originates or purchases through
portfolio acquisitions.  Unrelated institutions purchasing the Company's
installment sales contracts individually and directly from company-owned retail
centers perform their own recordkeeping and collection activities, although the
Company is in some cases responsible for repossessing homes in the event such
action becomes necessary.

Although the terms of the installment sales contracts vary according to the
financial institutions which purchase the contracts, most contracts provide
that the failure to make a payment as scheduled is an event of default which
gives rise to the right to repossess the home.  However, it is the policy of
the Company,  not to repossess the home until payments are three months
delinquent unless the borrower has no apparent ability to bring payments
current, in which case repossession may occur sooner.  The Company generally
follows the





                                       7
<PAGE>   8
same policy with respect to loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA,
although the Company must also file a notice of claim within nine months after
default with the agency to preserve its rights under the programs.

The following table sets forth delinquent installment sales contracts as a
percentage of the total number of installment sales contracts on which the
Company provided servicing and was either contingently liable or owner.  A
contract is considered delinquent if any payment is past- due 30 days or more.

Generally, the Company pays off the related installment contract upon
repossession of a home and then resells the home.  The Company believes that as
long as it is able to sell repossessed homes at satisfactory margins, the
increased repossession costs associated with payoffs of installment sales
contracts will be largely offset by resales of repossessed homes. See Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report to
Shareholders.  There can be no assurance that the Company's future results with
respect to the payoff and resale of repossessed homes will be consistent with
its past experience.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS.  The Company acts as agent on physical damage and credit
life insurance written by unaffiliated insurance companies (ceding companies)
for purchasers of its manufactured homes.  During the fiscal year ended June
30, 1994, the Company acted as the agent on physical damage policies on
approximately 80% of the installment sales contracts originated on which it is
directly or contingently liable.  Subsequent to January 1, 1993, physical
damage policies issued through the Company's agency were reinsured through
Vanderbilt Property and Casualty Insurance Co., LTD (VPC), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company incorporated during fiscal year 1993.   The credit
life insurance policies issued through the Company's agency were reinsured
through Vanderbilt Life and Casualty Insurance Co., LTD, (VLCIC) a
majority-owned subsidiary of the Company.

REGULATION

The Company's manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal, state and
local laws.  Construction of manufactured housing is governed by the National
Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. In 1976, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued regulations under this
Act establishing comprehensive national construction standards.  The HUD
regulations cover all aspects of manufactured home construction, including
structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads and thermal protection.  The
Company's manufacturing facilities and the plans and specifications for its
manufactured homes have been approved by a HUD-designated inspection agency.  A
HUD-approved organization regularly inspects the Company's manufactured homes
for compliance during construction.  Failure to comply with the HUD regulations
could expose the Company to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing the
Company's plants.  The Company believes the homes it manufactures comply with
all present HUD requirements.  In addition, certain components of manufactured
homes are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission which
is empowered, in certain circumstances, to ban the use of component materials
believed to be hazardous to health and to require the manufacturer to repair
defects in components in its homes.  In February 1983, the Federal Trade
Commission adopted regulations requiring disclosure of a manufactured home's
insulation specification.

A variety of laws affect the sale of manufactured homes on credit by the
Company.  The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (Truth-in- Lending) and
Regulation Z (issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)
require written disclosure of information relative to such credit sales,
including the amount of the annual percentage rate and the finance charge.  The
Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires disclosure of certain
information used as a basis to deny credit.  The Federal Equal Credit
Opportunity Act and Regulation B (issued by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System) prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant
based on sex, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, age
(provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), receipt of income from
any public assistance program or the good faith exercise by the applicant of
any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.  Regulation B establishes
administrative requirements for compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act and, among other things, requires the Company to provide a customer whose
credit request has been denied with a statement of reasons for the denial.  The
Federal Trade Commission has issued or proposed various Trade Regulation Rules
dealing with unfair credit practices, collection efforts, preservation of
consumers' claims and defenses and the like.  The Company is also subject to
the provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act which regulates the
manner in which the Company collects payments on  installment sales contracts.
Installment sales contracts eligible for inclusion in the GNMA Program are
subject to credit underwriting requirements of the FHA or the VA.

The movement and use of the Company's manufactured homes are subject to highway
use laws, ordinances and regulations of various federal, state and local
authorities.  Such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and
impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements.  The
Company's manufactured homes and its development of manufactured housing
communities are also subject to local zoning and housing regulations.





                                       9
<PAGE>   10
The Company is subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission
Improvement Act which regulates the descriptions of warranties on products.
The description and substance of the Company's warranties are also subject to a
variety of state laws and regulations.

VPC and VLCIC are subject to insurance and other regulations of the British
Virgin Islands.

COMPETITION

The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at the manufacturing
and retail levels in terms of price, service, delivery capabilities and product
performance.  There are many firms in direct competition with the Company.  The
Company believes it has a competitive advantage over firms which do not have
manufacturing, retailing and financing capabilities.  Since the Company's homes
are a form of low-cost housing, they compete with other forms of such housing
including apartments and conventionally-built and prefabricated homes.  Some of
the Company's competitors are larger and have significant financial resources
while other competitors are quite small in relation to the size of the Company.
The capital requirements for entry into both the manufacturing and retail
fields are relatively small, with retail and inventory financing generally
available to a prospective dealer.  The Company is not able to estimate the
total number of competitors in its marketing area.

EMPLOYEES

As of June 30, 1994, the Company employed 3,955 persons.  Of these, 1,045 were
employed in retail sales, 2,281 in manufacturing, 263 in financial services,
261 in communities and 105 in executive and administrative positions.  The
Company does not have any collective bargaining agreements and considers its
employee relations to be good.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

As required by the Securities and Exchange Commission Rules under Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which became effective on May 1, 1991, the
Company noted that for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994,  all required Forms
3, 4 and 5 were timely filed for its officers, directors and greater than
ten-percent beneficial owners except that one Form 4 for Mr. Warren Neel
covering the purchase of the Company's common stock was filed late.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company's executive offices and Financial Services operations are located
in Knoxville, Tennessee in several wholly-owned one-story buildings made up of
modular units (built by the Bean Station single-section plant) which total
approximately 30,000 square feet of office space and approximately 16,000
square feet in an office building owned 50% by the Company and 50% by a related
party.  See "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."  The
following table sets forth the properties which the Company uses for its
manufacturing operations and locations of its manufactured housing communities.
All of the buildings used for manufacturing operations are constructed of
fabricated metal on a concrete slab.

The company-owned retail centers are generally one  to four acre sites with a
manufactured office unit serving as sales office.  The balance of a retail
center site is devoted to the display of homes.  Of the 165 retail centers, 73
are owned and 92 occupy leased property.   The Company does not believe that
any of the property owned or leased for an individual retail center is material
to its overall business.

All of the properties described above are well maintained, adequately insured
and suitable for the purposes for which they are being used by the Company.
The Company believes that its properties are adequate for its near-term needs.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

No material legal proceedings are pending other than routine litigation
incidental to the business of the  Company.   The Company believes that such
proceedings will not have any material adverse effect on it or its operations.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SHAREHOLDERS.

No matters were submitted to shareholders during the last quarter of the fiscal
year.

factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  Additionally,  certain
of the Company's financing agreements have various covenants that restrict
payments which may be made for dividends and other stock transactions.  At June
30, 1994, the aggregate amount of earnings available for cash dividends or for
repurchase of the Company's stock was $281,480,000.

FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993
Total revenues for the year ended June 30, 1994, increased 32% because of the
33% increase in manufactured housing sales and the 29% rise in financial
services and other income.
   Net sales of the Retail Group rose 26% to $318 million primarily due to a
15% rise in the average number of company-owned retail centers open during the
year, a 9% increase in the average home price and a slight increase in the
average number of homes sold per Company retail center.  The rise in the
average home price resulted from a continued shift in product mix toward larger
single and multi-section homes.  Multi-section homes represented 30% of all
homes sold by the Retail Group versus 28% in the prior year.
   During the year, the Company acquired or opened 23 retail locations while
one unprofitable retail center was closed.  The Company constantly evaluates
specific local markets and opens, acquires, or closes retail centers as
conditions warrant.
   Net sales of the Manufacturing Group to independent dealers increased 47% to
$173 million due to the 36% increase in the number of homes sold and an 8%
increase in the average wholesale price.  The increase in the average home
price is due mainly to improved recouping of raw materials costs and a shift in
the product mix toward the more expensive multi-section home.  Multi-section
homes accounted for 34% of total shipments versus 31% last year.
   Net sales of the Communities Group rose 30% to $20 million primarily due to
a 20% rise in unit sales and an 8% improvement in the average home price.
   The 29% increase in financial services and other income to $118 million from
$92 million resulted principally from a $7 million increase in the gains on
sale of installment contract receivables, net of amortization, from the
wholly-owned finance subsidiary, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc. (VMF), a
$5 million rise in rental revenues in the Communities operation, and a $10
million growth in earned insurance premiums and commissions.
   The following table reflects the fluctuations in interest and loan servicing
revenues and financial services interest expense related to changes in interest
and servicing rates and changes in the average balances of receivables owned,
receivables sold and debt.  Receivables owned or sold are the installment
contract receivables related to the retail sale of homes by the Company and
independent dealers and purchases of contracts from unrelated financial
institutions.  Receivables owned generate interest income and are used to
collateralize debt or, in certain cases, represent the Company's subordinated
interest in a pool of receivables accounted for on the consolidated basis.
Receivables sold are pooled and generate loan service revenues equal to the
excess of principal and interest collected over the amount required to be
remitted to investors after deducting net credit losses.  Servicing is retained
by the Company in all cases.  The change due to both rate and volume has been
allocated in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of
the change in each.  Comparative fluctuations are given between the years ended
June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992:

         For the year ended June 30, 1994, interest and loan servicing revenues
rose $5 million, or 9%, to $60 million.  The average balance of receivables
owned increased 1% to $248 million with a decrease in the weighted averaged
interest rate to 11.6% from 13.6%.  The average balance of receivables sold
increased 32% to $658 million with an increase in the weighted average loan
service spread to 4.2% from 3.9%.
         Financial Services' interest expense decreased $4 million, or 33%, to
$8 million.  Average debt collateralized by installment contract receivables
dropped 35% to $74 million with an increase in the weighted average interest
rate to 10.8% from 10.1%.  Loan covenants preclude prepaying these obligations.
         Gross profit margins in 1994 declined slightly to 29.9% from 30.5%
last year.  The decrease is primarily the result of higher lumber costs
temporarily absorbed by the Manufacturing Group during the second and third
quarters and a shift in the Manufacturing/Retail sales mix to a greater
proportion of manufacturing wholesale sales which have lower margins.
         Selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.1% and 29.6% of
sales for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Substantially
all of the increase is attributable to the Financial Services operations:
additional staff to service the 37% growth in receivables serviced and the
claims costs of the insurance subsidiaries formed in January 1993.
         No provision for credit losses and contingencies was made in 1994 or
1993 due to the excellent loss and delinquency experience of the receivables
for which the Company is directly or contingently liable.  Net losses as a
percentage of loans outstanding for fiscal 1994 dropped to 0.3% from 0.6% last
year while delinquency rates declined to 1.2% of contracts originated by VMF at
June 30, 1994, versus 1.4% at the same time last year.  On June 30, 1994,
reserves equaled 1.5% of outstanding loans owned or on which the Company has
contingent liability.

FISCAL 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1992
Total revenues for the year ended June 30, 1993, increased 28% because of the
30% increase in manufactured housing sales and the 23% rise in financial
services and other income.
         Net sales of the Retail Group rose 26% to $252 million primarily due
to an 8% increase in the average number of homes sold per company-owned retail
center, a 6% rise in the average number of company-owned retail centers open
during the year, and an 11% increase in the average home price.  The rise in
the average home price is primarily attributable to a shift in the product mix
toward multi-section homes and larger single-section homes.  Multi-section
homes represented 28% of all homes sold by the Retail Group versus 26% in the
prior year.  The Company increased prices, in certain cases, on retail sales,
which are individually negotiated transactions, in response to market factors
and an increase in lumber prices over the prior year.
         During the year, the Company acquired or opened 19 retail locations
while three unprofitable retail centers were closed.  The Company constantly
evaluates specific local markets and opens, acquires, or closes retail centers
as conditions warrant.
         Net sales of the Manufacturing Group to independent dealers increased
31% to $117 million due to the 23% increase in the number of homes sold and a
6% increase in the average wholesale price.  The increase in the average home
price is due mainly to the rise in lumber prices from the prior year partially
offset by a shift in the product mix toward the less expensive single-section
home: 69% of units sold in fiscal 1993 versus 66% in the prior year.


                                      14
<PAGE>   5
Production capacity for single-section models was added in July 1992.  Two
additional production facilities for multi-section homes were acquired in the
spring and summer of 1993.
         Net sales of the Communities Group rose 113% to $15 million primarily
due to the 75% increase in the average number of communities owned and a 21%
increase in the average number of homes sold per community, partially offset by
a 7% drop in the average home price.  The decline in the average home price
relates to a slight shift in product mix toward less expensive used and
single-section models.
         The 23% increase in financial services and other income to $92 million
from $74 million resulted principally from a $7 million increase in the gains
on sale of installment contract receivables, net of amortization, by VMF an $8
million rise in rental revenues in the communities operation, and a $3 million
growth in insurance premiums and commissions.  Of the $7 million increase in
gains on sale of installment contract receivables, net of amortization,
approximately $3 million was reported in the fourth quarter as the result of an
adjustment to the discount rate.  The adjustment to the discount rate resulted
from an analysis of relevant factors such as the impact of the continuing
decline of interest rates, actual prepayment experience and consultations with
investment advisors.
         For the year ended June 30, 1993, interest and loan servicing revenues
fell $2 million, or 4%, to $55 million.  The average balance of receivables
owned decreased 13% to $246 million with a decrease in the weighted averaged
interest rate to 13.6% from 15.1%.  The average balance of receivables sold
increased 39% to $497 million with a decrease in the weighted average loan
service spread to 3.9% from 4.0%.  In March 1992, the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC) contracted with the Company to act as master servicer for
manufactured housing contract receivables.  The average balance of receivables
serviced was $167 million with a service fee of 1.2%.  The increase in 1993
revenues reflects a full year of servicing under this contract compared to
approximately three months in 1992.
         Financial Services' interest expense decreased $5 million, or 30%, to
$12 million.  Average debt collateralized by installment contract receivables
dropped 28% to $115 million with a decline in the weighted average interest
rate to 10.1% from 10.4%.  Loan covenants preclude prepaying these obligations.
         Gross profit margins in 1993 dropped to 30.5% from 30.6% last year.
The decrease is primarily attributable to a higher charge to earnings than in
the prior year related to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory
valuation ($4 million charge in 1993 versus $1 million in 1992).  The decrease
in gross profit margins related to the LIFO adjustment is almost completely
offset by an improvement in margins mainly due to increased retail prices.
         Selling, general and administrative expenses were 29.6% and 28.6% of
sales for the years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The rise is
due mainly to higher incentive compensation costs in the Retail Group and
increased compensation and fixed expense items such as property taxes,
insurance and depreciation in communities.  The fixed expenses of the
Communities Group rose as a percentage of consolidated sales since there was an
86% increase in home sites owned and a 117% rise in sites rented during fiscal
1993.  Partially offsetting the increase in expenses were improvements in
general corporate insurance costs for the entire Company and home delivery and
set-up expenses in retail operations.
         No provision for credit losses and contingencies was made this year
compared to a provision of 1.1% of sales last year due to the excellent
charge-off and delinquency experience of the receivables for which the Company
is directly or contingently liable, the level of reserves for credit losses and
contingent liabilities in light of the portfolio performance, and the practice
begun in fiscal 1993 of selling most of the Company's conventional receivables
without recourse (versus selling them with limited recourse or borrowing
against the receivables as in the past).  Net losses as a percentage of loans
outstanding for fiscal 1993 dropped to .2% from .4% last year while delinquency
rates declined to 1.4% of contracts originated by VMF at June 30, 1993, versus
2.0% at the same time last year.  On June 30, 1993 reserves equaled 2.3% of
outstanding loans owned or on which the Company had contingent liability.
         Inventories increased at June 30, 1993, from June 30, 1992:

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
The increase in revenues and net income during the fourth quarters of fiscal
1994 and 1993 are not indicative of future operating trends but rather reflect
the seasonality of the manufactured housing industry.  In recent years,
approximately 30% of the Company's sales have occurred in the fourth quarter.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
During fiscal 1994, the Company originated and acquired approximately $384
million of installment contract receivables.  The Company financed these
originations and acquisitions primarily through the pooling and sale of
approximately $320 million of installment contract receivables.  The remainder
of the funding came from cash flows and cash balances.  The Company invested
approximately $14 million in the acquisition of 13 properties for manufactured
housing communities and $8 million in related rental units, approximately $9
million for the opening of company-owned retail centers, $4 million for
improvement of existing manufacturing facilities and approximately $1 million
for other fixed assets using cash generated from operations.
         The Company expects to invest approximately $27 million in 1995 in the
acquisition or construction of properties for manufactured housing communities,
up to $6 million for new company-owned retail centers, up to $14 million for
the construction and improvement of manufacturing facilities and to originate
$350 million of installment contract receivables.  The Company anticipates to
meet cash needs for 1995 and thereafter with cash flows from operations,
current cash balances, and sale of installment contract receivables and GNMA
certificates.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard (SFAS
No. 109) that revises the accounting for income taxes.  The Company adopted
SFAS No. 109 effective July 1, 1993.  The $3 million cumulative effect of the
change in method of accounting for income taxes was reported in the fiscal
quarter ending September 30, 1993.  The accounting standard is discussed in
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION
Inflation has had an insignificant impact on the Company over the past several
years.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Clayton Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Clayton Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994, and 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
         On July 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes as described in Note 1.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

         VMF provides servicing for investors in installment contract
receivables.  Total contracts serviced at June 30, 1994, and 1993, including
contracts held for investment, were approximately $1,316 million and $961
million, respectively.

INCOME RECOGNITION
         Sales to independent dealers of homes produced by CHI are recognized
as revenue upon shipment. Retail sales are recognized when cash payment is
received, or in the case of credit sales, which represent the majority of
retail sales, when a down payment is received and the customer enters into an
installment sales contract.  Most of these installment sales contracts, which
are normally payable over 36 to 180 months, are sold to VMF.
         As is customary in the manufactured housing industry, CHI receives
from VMF and other financial institutions endorsement fees over the lives of
installment contract receivables in consideration for CHI's guaranty of such
installment contract receivables.    Additionally, CHI receives agent's
commissions on physical damage and credit life insurance sold to manufactured
home purchasers.  Premiums from credit life and physical damage insurance
policies reinsured by CV, VLAC and VPC, which represent single payment
contracts with terms of one to five years, are recognized as income over the
terms of the contracts.  Claims and expenses are matched to recognize profits
over the life of the contracts.  This matching is accomplished by means of the
provision for unearned premiums and the deferral and subsequent amortization of
policy acquisition costs.
         Installment contract receivables originated or purchased by VMF are
sold to investors or pledged as collateral to long-term lenders.  VMF retains
servicing in both cases.  Profit (loss) on installment contract receivables
sold to investors is recorded at the time of sale and represents the discounted
present value of the excess (deficiency) of principal and interest to be
collected during the expected normal life of the contracts over: 1) the amount
required to be remitted to investors; 2) the normal service spread of
comparable contracts; and 3) the estimated net credit losses.  Profit from
installment contract receivables sold without recourse is increased, in certain
cases, by the reversal of the reserve for credit losses attributable to the
receivables sold.
         Certain of the installment contract receivables are purchased in bulk
at a discount.  The purchase discounts are allocated between unamortized
discount and the reserve for credit losses based on management's assessment of
risks existing in the portfolio.  Unamortized discount is amortized into
revenue over the life of the related portfolio after giving consideration to
prepayments.  Adjustments between the reserve for credit losses and unamortized
discount are made to reflect changes in the estimated collectibility of each
portfolio purchased.
         Most of the installment contract receivables are with borrowers in the
southern portion of the United States and are collateralized by manufactured
homes.
         Interest income on installment contract receivables is recognized by a
method which approximates the interest method.  Service fee income is
recognized as the service is performed.

Inventories - Manufactured Housing
         New homes and raw materials are valued at the lower of cost, using the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory valuation, or market.
Previously-owned manufactured homes are valued at estimated wholesale prices,
which are not in excess of net realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment - Manufactured Housing
         Land and improvements, buildings, and furniture and equipment are
valued at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while
replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life
of the respective assets, are expensed currently.  When depreciable assets are
sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts, and any gain or loss is included in earnings for the period.
Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method with estimated
useful lives as follows:

<TABLE>
         <S>                                      <C>
         Land improvements  . . . . . . . . . .   3-28 years
         Buildings  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   7-25 years
         Furniture and equipment  . . . . . . .   3-10 years
</TABLE>

Warranty Obligation - Manufactured Housing
         Manufactured Housing warrants its homes against manufacturing defects
for a period of one year commencing at the time of the retail sale.  Warranty
costs are accrued for sales to independent dealers.  Warranty costs related to
the sales at company-owned retail centers are not material and are recognized
as incurred.

Income Taxes
         Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS No. 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes."
Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on
the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets
and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate.  Deferred income tax
expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from
period to period.  The adoption resulted in a decrease in the deferred tax
liability of $3 million.

Reserves for Credit Losses and Contingent Liabilities
         Reserves for credit losses are established related to installment
contract receivables.  Actual credit losses are charged to reserves when
incurred.  The reserves established for such losses are determined based on the
Company's historical loss experience after adjusting for current economic
conditions.  Management, in assessing loss experience and economic conditions,
adjusts reserves through periodic provisions.  The Company also maintains a
reserve for contingent liabilities related to guarantees of installment
contract receivables sold with recourse.  Reserves and the applicable
provisions related to guarantees are considered as part of the Manufactured
Housing business segment.


                                       20

Net Income Per Share
         Primary earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented,
including common share equivalents arising from stock options.  Fully diluted
earnings per share have been computed assuming conversion of the Company's
convertible subordinated debentures.  The fully diluted computation adds to net
income the interest expense (net of income tax) on the debentures.

Cash Equivalents
         For purposes of the statement of cash flows, all unrestricted highly
liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents.

Other
         Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1993 and 1992
financial statements to conform to the 1994 presentation.
         Per share and share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a
5-for-4 stock split effected as a 25% stock dividend in December 1993.

</TABLE>

         The estimated principal payments on the debt of VMF are based on the
scheduled payment and estimated prepayment of principal of the installment
contract receivables collateralizing such debt.  Certain debt agreements
require fixed payments which approximate the scheduled payments of the
underlying installment contract receivables.
         On March 1, 1994, the Company called for redemption all of its 7.75%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2003.  Substantially all of the $40
million of such debentures converted into approximately 4 million shares of
common stock.
         Certain of the long-term obligations have various covenants relating
to working capital, total indebtedness and dividend payments.  At June 30,
1994, the aggregate amount of earnings available for cash dividends or for
repurchase of Company stock was approximately $281 million.

NOTE 8 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
         The Company has a 401(k) profit-sharing plan covering all employees
who meet participation requirements.  The amount of the Company's contribution
is discretionary as determined by the Board of Directors, up to the maximum
deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes.  Contributions accrued were
$2,171,000, $1,689,000, and $1,425,000, for the years ended June 30, 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
         Certain operating properties are rented under non-cancelable operating
leases which expire at various dates through 2001. Total rental expense under
operating leases was $2,159,000 in 1994, $3,100,000 in 1993, and $1,863,000 in
1992.  The following is a schedule of minimum rental commitments under
non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for retail centers, in effect at

Repurchase Agreements
         Institutions financing independent dealer purchases require the
Company to execute repurchase agreements.  As a result of these agreements, the
Company is contingently liable for repurchasing units in the event of a default
by the dealer to the lending institution.  These agreements are customary in
the manufactured housing industry, and the Company's losses in the past have
not been significant.

         Restricted cash and investments represent reserves required by: 1)
certain VMF servicing and debt agreements to be maintained until such time as
specified minimum repayments have been made; 2) trust account cash balances
required by certain VMF servicing agreements; and 3) insurance reserves
required by escrow or trust agreements.
         CHI and VMF have lines of credit totaling $60 million with $25 million
outstanding at June 30, 1994.  This short-term borrowing is included in other
liabilities and bears interest at an average rate of 4.9% based on the banks'
transactional rates at June 30, 1994.

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS No. 107),
"Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires that the CHI
disclose the estimated fair values of its financial instruments.  The following
methodologies and assumptions were used by CHI to estimate its fair value
disclosures for financial instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
         The carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, including those
restricted by agreement, equal those assets' fair values.

Future Servicing Rights Receivable
         Future servicing rights receivable is calculated using prepayment,
default and interest rate assumptions that CHI believes are appropriate at the
time of the sale of the installment contract receivables.  Although projected
performance is monitored after the sale, the Company does not alter the
underlying rate at which the future estimated cash flows are discounted once
the sale has been recorded.  The fair value of future servicing rights
receivable primarily revolves around an appropriate discount rate to be applied
to the asset as a whole.

         CHI used a discount rate and such other assumptions as it believed to
be used for similar instruments. CHI has estimated the fair value of its future
servicing rights receivable to approximate its carrying value as of June 30,
1994.

Contracts Held for Sale and as Collateral
         Contracts held for sale are generally recent originations or purchased
portfolios which will be sold with limited or no recourse during the following
year.  CHI does not charge fees to originate loans, and, as such, its contracts
have origination rates in excess of rates on the securities into which they
will be pooled.  CHI estimates the fair value of the contracts held for sale to
be the carrying amount plus the cost of origination.
         The carrying values of contracts pledged as collateral to long-term
lenders are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates
being offered for similar contracts.  The carrying amount of contracts with a
variable rate of interest is estimated to be at fair value.  The carrying value
of accrued interest adjusted for credit risk equals its fair value.

Long-term Obligations
         Long-term obligations consist primarily of debt collateralized by
contracts with maturities that coincide with the underlying contract
maturities.  The fair value of these financial instruments is based on the
current rates offered to CHI for debt of similar maturities using a discounted
cash flow calculation.  Loan covenants preclude prepaying VMF obligations.
         The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of CHI's financial
assets and liabilities are as follows:

- - ----------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

         Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
The estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from
offering for sale in a single transaction CHI's entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument.  The lack of uniform valuation methodologies introduces a
greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.  Comparability
to financial instruments between similar companies may not be reasonable
because of varying assumptions concerning the estimates of fair value.
