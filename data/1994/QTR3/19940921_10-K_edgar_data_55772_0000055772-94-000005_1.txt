The number of shares outstanding of the Registrant's common stock as of August
15, 1994 was:


                    Class A Common Stock -   7,357,323 shares
                    Class B Common Stock -  13,805,491 shares


The Class A Common Stock is not publicly traded and, therefore, no market value
is available.  The Registrant estimates that the aggregate market value of the
Class B Common Stock held by non-affiliates, as defined in Rule 405, on August
15, 1994 (based upon an estimate that 86.2% of the shares of Class B Common
Stock is held by non-affiliates and upon the average of the high and low prices
for Class B Common Stock on such date) was $275.2 million.

Portions of the Proxy Statement for Annual Meeting of Share Owners to be held on
October 11, 1994, are incorporated by reference into Part III of this Form 10-K.

Item 1. - Business


    As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Kimball International, Inc.,
the Registrant, and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
    The Company was incorporated in Indiana in 1939, and present management

Street, Jasper, Indiana.
    The Company operates in three principal business segments:  Furniture and
Cabinets, Electronic Contract Assemblies, and Processed Wood Products and Other.
The Company utilizes a substantial degree of vertical integration, as
approximately 43% of the final products of the Processed Wood Products and Other
Segment are used in the manufacturing processes in the Furniture and Cabinets
Segment.  
    The Company does not consider seasonal fluctuations to be significant. 
Production is carried on in facilities located in the United States, England,
Austria and Mexico.  In the U.S., the Company has facilities and showrooms in 15
states.
    Sales by segment, after elimination of intersegment sales, for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994 are as follows:

Segments

FURNITURE AND CABINETS

Historical Overview
    The Company began manufacturing wood furniture and cabinets in 1950 and has
manufactured and marketed office furniture under the Kimball (registered trade
mark) trade name since 1970.  Through an acquisition in 1969, the Company
entered into the manufacture and sale of Reproduction Victorian furniture.  In
1982, the Company began the manufacture and sale of French Provincial style
furniture.  In 1986 and 1987 it entered the lodging-hospitality furniture
industry and the long-term care portion of the healthcare furniture industry,
respectively.  In 1992, the Company began the manufacture and sale of office
furniture to be used in the home and in 1994, expanded its residential furniture
product line to include solid oak and cherry bedroom furniture.  Also in 1992,
the Company expanded its product offering with the acquisition of certain assets
and assumption of certain liabilities of Harpers, a metal office furniture
manufacturer.  Harpers has marketed metal office furniture under the Harpers
(registered trademark) trade name since 1982.  Kimball and Harpers office
furniture systems have broad market application, while the Kimball and National
casegoods and seating lines are more focused to the wood segment of the office
furniture industry.  The Cetra (registered trademark)line of Kimball office
furniture systems was introduced during fiscal year 1989 while the Footprint
(registered trademark)line, which integrates the Cetra system and helps
designers better manage office space, was introduced in fiscal year 1992.  Cetra
(registered tradedmark) and Footprint (registered trademark) both utilize TRAXX
(registered trademark), which increases space efficiency and eliminates the need
for a secondary support structure by using existing walls.    
     Through a predecessor acquired in 1966, L. Bosendorfer of Vienna, Austria,
the Company has been engaged in acoustical piano manufacturing and sales since
1828.  Domestically, the Company has been engaged in piano manufacturing, or
sales, since 1857 through a predecessor, W.W. Kimball Co., acquired in 1959. 
Piano manufacturing and sales represent a small part of the Furniture and
Cabinets Segment.  Approximately three years ago the Company realigned its piano
operations in the U.S. and last year restructured its piano operations in
                                     -5-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Europe in response to significant declines in the U.S. and worldwide piano
markets, which are believed to be permanent. 
    In addition to the product lines noted above, products in this segment also
include television, audio speaker and audio component cabinets and television
stands produced and sold on a contract basis for leading manufacturers in the
home entertainment industry.  The Company also produces a variety of other
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wood related products on a contract basis
including furniture for a leading home furniture manufacturer.

Locations 
    Office, home, hospitality and healthcare furniture, T.V. cabinets and
related products, which make up the largest part of this segment, are produced
at sixteen plants, eleven located in Indiana and one each in Kentucky,
Mississippi, Alabama, California and England.  Production at the California
plant ceased in July 1994, as the Company relocated its production of metal
office furniture from a leased facility in California to a Company owned 
facility in Idaho.  Of the sixteen facilities, ten produce office furniture,
one of which also manufactures healthcare furniture and one of which also
produces hospitality furniture, kitchen cabinet doors and trim accessories,
and other wood components; two produce T.V. cabinets and related products,
one of which also produces residential furniture and home furniture on a
contract basis; two produce hospitality furniture and healthcare furniture;
one produces Reproduction Victorian and French Provincial furniture; and lastly,
one produces metal beds for the healthcare product line and stamped metal parts,
which are used in other product lines of the Company as well as sold to
unaffiliated customers.  Nine of the sixteen plants presently producing wood
furniture and cabinets could interchange production between these two basic
products if needed.
    Acoustical pianos are produced in two facilities:  one located in Indiana
and one in Austria.  To utilize plant capacity at the Indiana facility,
additional OEM wood related products are manufactured and sold on a contract
basis.
    Two other facilities, one located in England and the other in Mexico,
produce piano components.  The Mexico facility also assembles electronic
components, electronic cable harnesses and other electronic products for the
Electronic Contract Assemblies Segment.  
    A facility in Jasper, Indiana houses an Education Center for dealer and
employee training, the
                                      -6-           <PAGE>
<PAGE>
Product Design and Research Center, and a Corporate showroom for product
display. 
    In the United States, showrooms and district warehouse facilities are
maintained in eleven cities for office furniture and five cities for home
furniture.  In certain cities there are separate office and home furniture
showrooms.  In addition, office furniture is maintained in a showroom in London,
England and in July 1994, an office furniture showroom opened in Toronto,
Canada.  In certain showrooms other Company products are also on display.
    
Marketing Channels 
    Kimball and National office furniture is marketed through Company
salespersons to independent dealers throughout North America and England.
Harpers markets its office furniture products through Company salespersons to
independent dealers in the Western states, and primarily through independent
manufacturers' representatives to independent dealers elsewhere in the United
States.  Reproduction furniture and residential furniture are generally marketed
through independent sales representatives to independent furniture dealers
throughout the United States.  Cabinets and contract furniture are generally
marketed through Company employees, while hospitality and healthcare furniture
is marketed through independent manufacturers' representatives.  The Company's
channel marketing strategy facilitates the sale of office furniture, upholstery
and piano product lines within the hospitality and healthcare channels.  Kimball
(registered trademark), Jasper American, Conn (registered trademark),
Bosendorfer (registered trademark) and private label pianos are marketed through
Company salespersons to independent dealers.  Piano components are both used
internally and sold to other piano manufacturers through Company salespersons.

Major Competitive Factors
   The major competitive factors in the office furniture industry are price in
relation to quality and appearance, the utility of the product, shorter customer
lead times, "on-time" delivery to the customer, and ability to respond to
requests for special, non-standard products.  The Company maintains sufficient
finished good inventories to be able to offer to domestic dealers prompt
shipment of certain lines of Kimball, National and Harpers office furniture,
thereby permitting dealers to maintain smaller inventories.  Many products are
shipped through the Company's
                                     -7-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
delivery system.  The Company believes that its trucking capability enables it
to reduce damage to shipments, enhance scheduling flexibility, and improve the
capability for "on-time" deliveries, which are all key competitive factors in
the office furniture industry.
    The major competitive factors in the cabinet, home furniture and OEM product
markets are quality, performance history and price.  Television, audio speaker
and audio component cabinets, television stands and contract home furniture are
produced to customer specifications from specific orders and finished goods
inventories are generally small, consisting of goods awaiting shipment to a
specific customer.  The Company's own line of home furniture are offered for
sale on an immediate ship basis.  Competitive factors in the hospitality and
healthcare furniture markets are quality, performance history, "on-time"
delivery, and price.  While the Company produces hospitality and healthcare
furniture to customers' specifications on a contract basis, the company also
offers its own line of hospitality and healthcare furniture.  
     The major competitive factors in the acoustical piano industry are price in
relation to quality, appearance and acoustical tone. 

Competitors
    There are many manufacturers of office, home, hospitality, and healthcare
furniture.  The Company believes, however, that there are a limited number of
relatively large producers of wood office, hospitality and healthcare furniture,
of which the Company believes that it is one of the larger in net sales.  In
many instances wood office furniture competes in the market with metal office
furniture.  Based on available industry statistics, metal office furniture has a
larger share of the total market than does wood.  The Company has positioned
Harpers as a vehicle to strengthen its market share in the non-wood segment of
the industry.  There are two other domestic manufacturers of Reproduction
Victorian furniture and a limited number of manufacturers of French Provincial
furniture.  While the Company believes it has a significant share of the
Reproduction Victorian furniture domestic market, this market in total is a very
small part of the total home furniture market, as is the market for French
Provincial Furniture.
         The Company believes that it is one of the largest independent domestic
manufacturers of television and audio speaker cabinets, but certain
manufacturers of televisions and audio speakers, including some customers of the
Company, produce cabinets for their own use.
                                     -8-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
The acoustical piano business is characterized by a number of competitors,
including, in addition to the Company, what are thought to be two major domestic
manufacturers and several international manufacturers.
 
Raw Material Availability
    Many components used in the production of furniture, cabinets and pianos are
manufactured internally within the group or by other groups of the Company,
including processed wood parts, and on a limited basis, metal stamped parts and
certain polyurethane molded plastics.  Raw materials used in the production of
wood furniture and cabinets are generally readily available.  Certain metal
components used in various wood office furniture products, predominately Cetra
and seating, are purchased in a pre-fabricated stage with additional fabrication
and finishing performed by the Company.  Raw materials used in the manufacture
of metal office furniture, primarily rolled steel, is readily available from
U.S. and foreign sources.  Raw materials used in the Company's piano lines are
readily available.
                                     -9-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
ELECTRONIC CONTRACT ASSEMBLIES

    The Company entered the electronic contract assemblies market in 1985 with
knowledge acquired from the production of electrical keyboards for musical
instruments, which was first produced in 1963.  Electronic and
electro-mechanical products (electronic assemblies) are sold on a contract basis
and produced to customers' specifications.  Production takes place at three
manufacturing facilities, two located in Indiana and one in Mexico.  The
facility in Mexico assembles electronic components, electronic cable harnesses
and other electronic products for sale to outside customers.  In addition, and
to a lesser extent, the facility assembles piano components and sub-assemblies
for use in the Company's piano lines.  Products from the Mexico facility are
accumulated at, and shipped from, a Texas warehouse.
    Products are marketed by Company salespersons and independent sales
representatives on a contract basis.  As contract electronic assemblies are
manufactured based on specific orders, finished goods inventories are generally
small consisting of goods awaiting shipment to a specific customer.
    The competitive factors in the electronic contract assemblies market are
price, quality, production flexibility and reliability of "on-time" delivery. 
The Electronics industry is very competitive, with many manufacturers of
contract electronic assemblies.  The Company does not have a significant share
of the market for such products.  Raw Materials for contract electronic products
are generally readily available from both domestic and foreign sources.
    Included in this segment are sales to three customers which account for
21.8%, 21.4% and 17.7% of consolidated net sales in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Included in sales to these three customers are sales of
electronic assemblies to Kelsey-Hayes Company, Inc. which accounted for
approximately 11.9% of consolidated net sales in the year ended June 30, 1994,
compared to 12.4% in the year ended June 30, 1993 and 10.8% in the year ended
June 30, 1992.  

                                     -10-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
PROCESSED WOOD PRODUCTS AND OTHER

    The Company's manufacture and sale of processed wood products includes
unprocessed lumber, dimension lumber, plywood and veneer.  The Company owns and
operates four sawmills, four lumber yards, four dimension lumber plants, a plant
which manufactures contract wood products, a sliced veneer plant, two facilities
which produce plywood and related products and one face veneer plant.
    Processed wood products manufactured by the Company are used internally as
well as sold to others.  For fiscal year 1994, an estimated 43% of the total
production of these operations was for products used internally in other
segments' end products.  Products sold to others are marketed principally to
furniture manufacturers, primarily through Company personnel.
    The competitive factors in the processed wood products market are price,
quality and availability.  In processed wood materials, the Company competes
with many integrated forest and specialty hardwood product companies and does
not have a significant share of the market for such products.  Raw materials
used in this business segment are generally readily available.
    Various miscellaneous products are manufactured by the Company for sales to
unaffiliated customers as well as for its own use.  These include polyurethane
and polyester molded products, carbide cutting tools and related services on
cutting tools.  Products and services of the Company's automotive service center
are also sold to unaffiliated customers.

RESEARCH, PATENTS, AND TRADEMARKS
    Research costs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 were approximately
$8,557,000 as compared to $5,913,000 and $3,479,000 for the years ended June 30,
1993 and 1992, respectively.  Research activities include the development of
manufacturing processes for electronic sub-assemblies, major process
improvements, wood and plastic technology, and new product development. 
    The Company owns the Kimball (registered trademark) trademark, which it
believes is material to its office, electronic, hospitality, healthcare, piano
and home furniture businesses, and owns the following trademarks which it
believes  are material to its piano business only:  Bosendorfer (registered
trademark); and to the furniture business only:  National (registered
trademark), Cetra (registered trademark), Footprint (registered trademark),
ARTEC (registered trademark), TRAXX (registered trademark) and Harpers
(registered trademark).  The Company also owns certain patents and other
trademarks and has certain other patent applications pending, which in the
Company's opinion are not material to its business.

ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY MATTERS
    The Company's operations are subject to various Federal, State and Local
laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters.  The Company
believes that it is in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations
and that there are no material liabilities associated in regard to such items. 
    The Company is dedicated to excellence, leadership and stewardship in
matters of protecting the environment and communities in which the Company has
operations.  The Company believes that continued compliance with Federal, State
and Local laws and regulations which have been enacted relating to the
protection of the environment will not have a material effect on its capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  Management believes capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment during the two fiscal years
ending June 30, 1996 will not represent a material portion of total capital
expenditures during those years.

    The Company's manufacturing operations require significant amounts of
energy, including natural gas and oil.  Federal and State statutes and
regulations control the allocation of fuels available to the Company, but to
date the Company has experienced no interruption of production due to such
regulations.  In its wood processing plants, significant energy requirements are
satisfied internally by the use of the Company's own wood waste products.

EMPLOYEES
    At June 30, 1994, the Company had 8,463 full time employees, of which 7,539
were employed  in the United States and 924 in foreign countries.  The Company
has no collective bargaining agreements with respect to its domestic employees. 
All of the Company's foreign operations are subject to collective bargaining
arrangements.  The Company believes that its employee relations are good.

</TABLE>
    Including certain leased furniture warehousing and showroom areas excluded
from the above listing, total facilities approximate 6.8 million square feet. 
(See Note 6 - Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in
Item 8, for additional information concerning capitalized leases and Note 5 -
Commitments - Leases, for additional information concerning non-capitalized
leases.)
    Included in Processed Wood Products and Other are executive, national sales
and administrative offices, an automotive service center, a product design and
research center, the production facility for polyurethane and polyester molded
plastic, carbide cutting tools and related services on cutting tools, and an
energy center for the Kimball Industrial Park consisting of 3 trifuel boilers,
each with 1,000 hp. capacity. 
    Generally, properties are utilized at normal capacity levels on a single
shift basis, with several  properties utilizing a reduced second shift to meet
increased demand levels.  At times, certain facilities were not utilized at
normal capacity levels during the fiscal year, because of declines in sales. 
The Energy Center is not operating at full capacity.
    Non-capitalized leases totaling 643,000 square feet expire in fiscal years
1995 through 2012.  One lease totaling 535,000 square feet which supports the
Company's production of metal office furniture in California expires in fiscal
year 1995 as the Company relocates these operations from California to a new
Company owned facility in Idaho.  Substantially all of the remaining leases are
subject to renewal options on the part of the Company.  Capitalized leases
expire in 1995, with ownership of the properties transferring to the Company
thereafter.  In addition to the above, the Company has Company owned or leased
facilities for showrooms and/or warehouses in twelve states in the United
States, as well as two locations in London, England and one in Vienna, Austria.
In July of 1994, the Company entered into a lease for a showroom in Toronto,
Canada.
                                     -15-<PAGE>

    The Company owns in fee approximately 13,862 acres of land which includes
land where various Company facilities reside, including approximately 189 acres
of land in the Kimball Industrial Park, Jasper, Indiana (a site for certain
production and other facilities and for future expansions), and approximately
12,942 acres generally for hardwood timber reserves.  Included in the
approximate 13,862 acres of land are approximately 60 acres in Post Falls,
Idaho, where a new Harpers plant is located.  The facility, which was completed
in July 1994, totals 461,000 square-feet and houses manufacturing and
administrative offices.  This facility is in addition to the previously stated
square footage amounts as of June 30, 1994 and replaces a 535,000 square foot
lease previously listed.  Relocation to the new facility and start-up operations
occurred in July 1994, with full production expected to take place by the third
quarter of fiscal 1995.

Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


OVERVIEW
Net sales totaled a record level of $822,484,000 in fiscal 1994, up 14% from
1993, as sales in each of the Company's three business segments--Furniture and
Cabinets, Electronic Contract Assemblies and Processed Wood Products and
Other--were above the prior year.  Operating income levels increased 23% over
1993, led by improved operating income performance in wood office furniture
product lines within the Furniture and Cabinets Segment.  Net income totaled
$36,169,000 in fiscal 1994, up 18% over the 1993 level.  The 1994 net income
level includes the impact of adopting FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, which increased net income by $1,200,000, or 5 cents per Class B
Share.  Fiscal 1993 net income was unfavorably impacted by a $2,850,000, or 13
cents per share, charge to restructure European piano operations.  Open orders
remained near record levels at June 30, 1994. 
    

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1994 Discussion
The 1994 record net sales level of $822,484,000 was the result of each of the
Company's three business segments experiencing growth over fiscal 1993,
including double digit sales growth in the two largest segments--Furniture and
Cabinets and Electronic Contract Assemblies.  

Sales in the Furniture and Cabinets Segment increased 15%, as all principal
product lines within this segment experienced increased sales levels over 1993. 
Overall, the sales improvement was led by increased sales of office furniture
casegoods and systems product lines, in which volumes increased on both mature
and new product line offerings.  Certain product lines within the Company's
total office furniture product offering experienced increases in market share.

Other product lines in the Furniture and Cabinets Segment that experienced
strong sales growth over 1993 include original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
cabinets and furniture, including a strong increase in sales of television and
speaker cabinets in wood and vinyl, and hospitality product line sales,
partially the result of large hospitality projects shipped in the first half of
the fiscal year.  Sales of other OEM wood products increased over prior year
levels, as the Company's domestic piano unit increased its production and sales
of these products to utilize excess plant capacity caused by a continuing
decline in worldwide piano markets.

Sales in the Electronic Contract Assemblies Segment increased 13% over the 1993
level due to increased sales of computer and automotive electronic assemblies. 
Included in this segment are sales to one customer that accounted for 12% of
consolidated net sales in 1994 and 1993.

Processed Wood Products and Other Segment sales were up 8%, largely due to
increased outside sales of wood products and plastic components. Increased
outside sales of wood products were the result of price and volume increases on
both lumber and dimension products.  Increased sales of plastic components were
the result of volume increases, partially due to customer diversification.

Consolidated cost of sales as a percent of net sales in 1994 increased by .6
percentage point, due to increased material costs, resulting from both a sales
mix change within business segments and increased material prices.  Labor costs
as a percent of net sales were flat, while overhead costs as a percent of net
sales were down from 1993, as the Company was able to hold fixed production
overhead costs relatively even with 1993 levels.  Although selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percent of net sales continue to trend downward,
down .7 percentage point when compared to the prior year, the Company continues
to incur expenses relating to its ongoing employee training and development
programs, process re-engineering, and development and implementation of enhanced
information systems including a new


                                  - 20 -<PAGE>
<PAGE>
enterprise business and manufacturing information system.  Operating income as
a percent of net sales increased .5 percentage point when compared to 1993.    

Most product lines within the Furniture and Cabinets Segment experienced
improvements in operating income levels when compared to fiscal 1993.  The
strongest improvement was in wood office furniture product lines, including
record operating income levels on Kimball Office Furniture product line sales.

While fiscal 1994 operating losses in the Company's European units were reduced
by approximately 41% when compared to 1993, both units are forecast to
continue to operate at a loss in the near term, as they continue to be
negatively impacted by weak economic conditions in their principal markets.  The
unit in England has also been negatively impacted by some operating
inefficiencies associated with the shift in its product line focus.

The Company incurred operating losses on steel office furniture product line
sales in fiscal 1994.  These losses were due to elevated relocation expenses,
increased marketing costs, and operating inefficiencies.  The Company forecasts
its steel office furniture lines will continue to operate at a loss over the
first half of fiscal 1995, before approaching monthly break-even levels sometime
in the second half, at which time the Company believes key learning curve
inefficiencies associated with the relocation will be diminished.

Operating income in the Electronic Contract Assemblies Segment decreased as a
result of a changing sales mix, expenses associated with process re-engineering,
development costs associated with the next generation of existing product lines
as well as material price increases.  The electronics industry remains very
competitive, which has caused the Company to experience some difficulty in
passing on higher operating costs to its customers.

In the Processed Wood Products and Other Segment, operating income increased
over 1993 levels, principally due to improved operating income on sales of
lumber and dimension products and plastic components.                  

Interest expense in 1994 was down from the prior year as a result of reduced
outside borrowings in the Company's European subsidiaries and interest
capitalized on the construction of the new Harpers steel furniture manufacturing
facility in Idaho.  Interest income was down in 1994 due to a lower average
investment balance and lower average yields when compared to the prior year. 
Other-net decreased in the current year as a result of increased commercial
truck transportation and distribution expenses and the net change in several
other income/expense items.

The 1994 effective tax rate decreased 3.5 percentage points below the 1993
level, largely due to reduced foreign operating losses, including the prior year
restructuring charge, for which no income tax benefit is available.  The 1994
effective tax rate includes the impact of a 1 percentage point increase in the
U.S. statutory tax rate and the impact of adopting FASB Statement No. 109 (as
discussed below), which reduced Taxes on Income by $1.2 million and the
effective tax rate by 2.0 percentage points.


Net income in 1994 was $36,169,000, or $1.71 per share of Class B Common Stock,
up 18% from the 1993 net income level of $30,583,000, or $1.45 per Class B
Share. 



1993 Discussion
The 1993 net sales level of $722,400,000 increased 17% above 1992, as sales
increased in all three of the Company's business segments.

Sales in the Furniture and Cabinets Segment increased 12%, largely due to
increased sales of office furniture systems and certain casegoods lines, lodging
furniture and the additional sales of Harpers, which was acquired in the third
quarter of fiscal 1992.
   
Sales of office furniture systems improved significantly over 1992 levels
primarily as a result of a
                                     -21-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
general trend throughout fiscal 1993 away from traditional casegoods to systems
and modular furniture and the additional sales of new product line offerings.
Sales of office furniture casegoods were up from 1992 levels, largely due to
increased sales of National Office Furniture casegoods product lines, which were
partially the result of new product line offerings and competitive pricing in
the marketplace.

Sales of hospitality furniture were up as the Company began to ship several
large hospitality projects in the latter half of the fiscal year.  Fiscal 1993
sales of television and speaker cabinets in wood and vinyl were flat, while
sales of musical keyboard products were down in both the U.S. and abroad as a
result of depressed worldwide markets for these products.   

Sales in the Electronic Contract Assemblies Segment increased 36% over the 1992
level.  The increased sales levels were the result of increased sales of
computer and automotive assemblies, in part due to customer diversification. 
Included in this segment are sales to one customer which accounted for 12% of
consolidated net sales. 

Processed Wood Products and Other Segment sales were up, largely due to
increased outside sales of wood products, primarily a result of price increases
on both lumber and dimension products.  The price increases were in response to
increased lumber material purchase costs, partially due to reduced supplies.

Consolidated cost of sales as a percent of net sales in 1993 increased 2.5
percentage points, largely due to increased material costs, resulting from both
a shifting product sales mix and increased material prices.  In 1993, the most
pronounced shift in product sales mix was to higher electronic assembly sales,
which carried a lower gross margin than most other principal product lines. 
Throughout 1993, the Company experienced rising material costs for electronic
component materials, lumber, veneer and other wood materials, partially due to
temporarily reduced supplies.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percent of net sales in 1993 decreased 1.4 percentage points when compared to
the prior year.  While the percentage was down, the Company continued to incur
expenses as a result of its ongoing employee training and development programs,
process re-engineering, and development and implementation of enhanced
information systems.  Operating income as a percent of net sales decreased 1.5
percentage points as stronger operating income performance in the U.S. was
offset by much weaker performance in Europe.

Operating income in the Furniture and Cabinets Segment decreased, primarily due
to significantly increased losses in the international furniture and musical
keyboard product operations, which more than offset a strong operating income
improvement in the U.S. musical keyboard product operations.

In the second quarter of 1993 the Company recorded a $2,850,000 charge to
restructure the Company's piano operations in England and Austria.  While both
subsidiaries progressed in terms of their individual restructuring strategies
over the last half of fiscal 1993, both operated at a loss in 1993 as their
principal markets remained weak. 

Operating income in the Electronic Contract Assemblies Segment increased due to
increased volume levels, better asset utilization and an expanded customer base.
The electronics industry remained very competitive with increasing pressure to
maintain and reduce pricing in spite of general cost increases on many component
materials.  

Processed Wood Products and Other Segment operating income was down, principally
due to reduced operating income on sales of veneer and laminated wood products
and plastic components.

Interest expense increased in 1993 as a result of increased debt levels in the
international subsidiaries during the first half of the fiscal year.  Interest
income decreased in 1993 in part due to lower interest rates and a higher
average investment balance in 1992 as the first half of 1992 reflected an
investment level before the acquisition of Harpers, which was funded entirely
out of
                                     -22-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
cash and short-term investments.  Other income-net decreased in 1993 as
1992 included $1,961,000 of nonoperating gain, net of non-tax expenses, relating
to insurance proceeds from an accidental fire that destroyed the Chandler
Veneers plant.

In 1993 the effective tax rate increased 6.2 percentage points over the 1992
level largely due to foreign operating losses, including the restructuring
charge, for which no income tax benefit was available.  The 1992 effective tax
rate benefited from the reorganization of subsidiaries in England that lowered
the rate by 1.7 percentage points.  The Company's U.S. effective tax rate
remained steady.

Net income in 1993 was $30,583,000, or $1.45 per share of Class B Common Stock,
down 21% from the 1992 net income level of $38,628,000, or $1.83 per Class B
Share.  The restructuring charge in 1993 decreased net income by $2,850,000, or
13 cents per Class B Share.  The 1992 net income level includes the effect of a
nonoperating gain relating to the fire at the Chandler facility, which increased
net income by $1,228,000, or 6 cents per Class B Share.
   
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments totaled $91.9 million at June
30, 1994, compared to $107.2 million at June 30, 1993.  Working capital and the
current ratio were a strong $186.1 million and 2.8 to 1, respectively, as of
June 30, 1994, compared to $195.4 million and 3.0 to 1, respectively, in the
prior year.  The Company expects to maintain this strong liquidity position
throughout fiscal 1995.

The Company generated a positive $58 million net cash from operating activities
in 1994, as positive cash flow provided by the Company's net income level was
somewhat reduced by an increased investment in accounts receivable.  The
positive cash flow from operating activities was offset by the Company's
internal funding of capital investments for the future including: the
construction of a new steel furniture manufacturing facility in Idaho, continued
investment in information technology, including a new enterprise business and
manufacturing information system, and cash used to purchase other capital assets
that together totaled approximately $53 million in 1994.  The Company used an
additional $22 million to fund financing activities, principally to pay
dividends.  Cash flow, excluding the effect of purchases and  maturities of
short-term investments, was a negative $15.3 million in 1994.

Fiscal 1994 was a period of high capital expansion for the Company, including
the construction of a new steel furniture manufacturing facility to relocate the
operations of Harpers from Torrance, California to Post Falls, Idaho.  The
Company anticipates total relocation cash expenditures, including expenditures
for the new facility, will approximate $38 million.  While relocation of the
operations is substantially complete, the Company forecasts cash payments
totaling approximately $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1995 relating
to activities surrounding the relocation.  Also in fiscal 1995, the Company
plans to continue the internal funding of investments in new information
technology.   

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes.  The impact of adopting the new statement, which, due to the
immateriality of this transaction was included in Taxes on Income in the
Consolidated Statement of Income, was $1,200,000, or 5 cents per Class B Share. 
This one-time adoption impact was triggered by a lowering of the Company's net
deferred tax liability as Statement No. 109 requires all deferred tax items be
established at current enacted statutory rates.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The management of Kimball International, Inc. is responsible for the preparation
of the accompanying financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
The financial statements, including the notes, were prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and include estimates and judgments,
which in the opinion of management are applied on a conservative basis.  All
financial information in this annual report is consistent with the financial
statements.

The Company maintains internal accounting control systems and related policies
and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with management's
authorization and properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied
upon for the preparation of the financial statements.  The design, monitoring
and revision of internal accounting control systems involve, among other things,
management's judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of
specific control measures.  The system is tested and evaluated regularly by the
Company's internal auditors as well as by independent public accountants in
connection with their annual audit.

An Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of three outside
directors, meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the
independent public accountants in connection with its review of matters relating
to the Company's internal audit program, the Company's system of internal
controls and the services of the independent public accountants.  The internal
auditors and the independent accountants have free and direct access to the
Audit Committee, and they meet with the Committee periodically, without
management present, to discuss appropriate matters.

The financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen & Co., independent
public accountants, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. 
As such, the independent accountants conduct such tests and related procedures
as they deem necessary to render their opinion as to the fairness of the
financial statements.

                  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To The Board of Directors and Share Owners of Kimball International, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition
of Kimball International, Inc. (an Indiana corporation) and subsidiaries as of
June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash
flows and share owners' equity for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimball
International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated
statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed under Item 14 are the
responsibility of the Company's management and are presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of the basic consolidated financial statements.  These schedules have been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied to the audit of the basic
consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly stated in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.

On January 23, 1992, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Harpers, a manufacturer of metal office furniture.  The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, operating results
of Harpers have been included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income
since acquisition.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:  For purposes of the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash equivalents consist primarily of
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at
the time of acquisition.  Short-term investments are cash investments, primarily
U.S. Government securities, municipal bonds, and limited partnership interests
in hedged debt and equity securities, with maturities exceeding three months at
the time of acquisition.  At June 30, 1994, approximately 31% of the short-term
investment portfolio was composed of limited partnership interests in hedged
debt and equity securities.  The portfolio strategy is to remain
"market-neutral" with the intent of earning rates of return in excess of current
treasury rates without taking on significantly higher degrees of risk.  The
Company is in the process of liquidating its investment in the limited
partnership interests of hedged debt and equity securities.  Other-net in the
Consolidated Statement of Income included net investment income on this
portfolio totaling $495,000 in 1994, $3,341,000 in 1993 and $1,763,000 in 1992.

Foreign Currency Translation:  Foreign financial statements (except for Mexico,
whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar) are translated under the
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52, whereby
foreign balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at
year-end, income accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange during
the year, and translation gains and losses are excluded from net income by being
recorded as a component of share owners' equity (foreign currency translation
adjustment).  This component of share owners' equity reflects the cumulative
effect of the translation adjustments which are excluded from net income. 
Financial statements of Mexican operations are translated into U.S. Dollars
using both the current and historical exchange rates, with translation gains and
losses included in net income.  The Consolidated Statement of Income includes a
net foreign exchange loss on transactions of $103,000 in 1994, a loss of
$260,000 in 1993 and a gain of $164,000 in 1992.

Inventory Pricing:  Inventories are stated at cost or market, whichever is
lower.  Cost includes material, labor and applicable manufacturing overhead and
is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of
domestic inventories and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for the remaining
inventories.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation:  Property and equipment are stated at
cost.  Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of the assets
using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated
methods for income tax purposes.  Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals and
betterments are expensed; major improvements are capitalized.

Capitalized Software:  Purchased software and related consulting fees are
capitalized at cost and amortized over the useful life of the software using the
straight-line method for both financial reporting and income tax purposes. 
Useful lives range from 2 to 7 years.  Capitalized software, net of related
accumulated amortization, amounted to $7,204,000 in 1994 and $965,000 in 1993,
and is included in Other Assets.

Medical Care and Disability Benefit Plans:  The Company is self-insured with
respect to certain medical care and disability benefit plans for substantially
all employees.  The costs for such plans are charged against earnings in the
year incurred.  The Company does not provide benefits under these plans to
retired employees.

Research and Development Costs:  The costs of research and development are
expensed as incurred.  These expenses were approximately, in millions, $8.6 in
1994, $5.9 in 1993 and $3.5 in 1992.

Income Taxes:  Effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of
accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method as
required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes.  Under the new rules, deferred taxes are required to be stated
at a net realizable value using current statutory tax rates.  The cumulative
effect of adopting FASB Statement No. 109 increased net income by $1.2 million
in 1994.  This cumulative effect is included in 1994 Taxes on Income.

Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the
consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the United States
taxes that may be payable on distribution to the United States because it is not
anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the United States.  If remitted,
the additional United States taxes paid would not be material.

Earnings Per Share:  Earnings per share are based on the average number of
shares outstanding and are computed using the two-class common stock method
because of the dividend preference of Class B Common Stock.  In the years ended
June 30, 1994 and 1992, outstanding stock options, if exercised, would not have
had a material dilutive effect on earnings per share.  There were no stock
options outstanding during the year ended June 30, 1993.

Off-Balance Sheet Risk:  The Company engages in several types of financing
arrangements with customers, primarily certain guarantees, and also has credit
risks in certain industries.  However, the amount of such risks, in dollar
terms, is not considered to be significant.


NOTE 2.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGE:

The Company's 1993 net income included a $2,850,000 charge, or $.13 per share,
to restructure the Company's piano operations in England and Austria.  The
restructuring charge in England included provisions for workforce reductions,
the write-down of certain inventory and equipment to net realizable value and
the reorganization of certain production lines as the subsidiary shifted its
industry focus from piano components to office furniture, kitchen cabinet doors,
accessory and trim parts for kitchens and baths, and furniture components.  The
restructuring charge in Austria included provisions for workforce reductions,
the write-down of certain inventory to net realizable value, production
realignment and other associated restructuring costs in response to what the
Company believed to be a permanent downward shift in the piano industry markets.


NOTE 3.  INVENTORIES:

The majority of domestic inventories are valued using the lower of last-in,
first-out (LIFO) cost or market method.  The remaining inventories, valued using
the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market method, represent
approximately 43% of consolidated inventories at June 30, 1994, 48% at June 30,
1993 and 31% at June 30, 1992.

Had the FIFO method been used for all inventories, net income would have been,
in millions, $1.2 higher in 1994, $1.0 higher in 1993, and $.03 lower in 1992. 
Additionally, inventories would have been, in millions, $19.6, $17.5 and $15.8
higher at June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, if the FIFO method had
been used.

Inventory components at June 30 are as follows:

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment totaled, in millions,
$26.9 for 1994, $26.2 for 1993 and $24.9 for 1992.  Imputed interest costs,
related to the financing of certain construction projects, of $345,000, $112,000
and $84,000 were capitalized during 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.


NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS - LEASES:

Operating leases for certain office, showroom, warehouse and manufacturing
facilities, and equipment, which expire 1995-2012, contain provisions under
which minimum annual lease payments are, in millions, $3.9, $2.4, $2.0, $1.7 and
$1.3 for the five years ended June 30, 1999, respectively, and aggregate $8.8
million from 2000 to the expiration of the leases in 2012.  The Company is
obligated under certain of the real estate leases to maintain the properties and
pay real estate taxes.

Total rental expenses (including rental expenses in prior years associated with
leases from the retirement trust - see Note 17) amounted to, in millions, $9.5,
$9.9 and $8.5 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.


NOTE 6.  LONG-TERM DEBT:

Long-Term Debt includes capitalized lease obligations expiring in fiscal year
1995.  These capitalized lease obligations relate to certain plant facilities
constructed or purchased with the proceeds from the sale of Industrial Revenue
Bonds and subsequently leased to the Company.  The remaining long-term debt
consists of foreign borrowings. Aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the
next five years are $1,196,000, $377,000, $277,000, $157,000 and $0,
respectively.  Interest rates range from 6% to 9.125%.  Based upon borrowing
rates currently available to the Company, the fair value of the Company's debt
approximates the carrying value.

NOTE 7.  RETIREMENT PLAN:

The Company has one trusteed defined contribution Retirement Plan in effect for
substantially all domestic employees meeting the eligibility requirements. 
Company contributions are based on a percent of net income as defined in the
plan; the percent of contribution is determined by the Board of Directors up to
specific maximum limits.  Payments by the Company to the trusteed plan are
vested and held for the sole benefit of participants.  Total contributions to
the Retirement Plan for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were approximately, in millions,
$9.0, $7.5 and $7.1, respectively.

Employees of certain foreign subsidiaries are covered by local pension or
retirement plans.  Annual expense and accumulated benefits of these foreign
plans are not significant to the consolidated financial statements.


NOTE 8.  INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS:

On August 11, 1987, the Board of Directors adopted the 1987 Stock Incentive
Program (1987 plan), which was approved by the Company's Share Owners on October
13, 1987.  Under this plan, 1,800,000 shares of Class B Common Stock are
reserved for incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and performance share awards to be
granted to officers and other key employees of the Company and to members of the
Board of Directors who are not employees.  Approximately 109 employees are
eligible to participate in the 1987 plan.

NOTE 9.  INCOME TAXES:

As stated in Note 1, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective July 1, 1993.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  A valuation reserve is
provided for deferred tax assets relating to foreign net operating losses, due
to uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets.

The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 1994,
are as follows:

NOTE 11.  COMMON STOCK:

Shares of Class B Common Stock are entitled to dividends, out of funds legally
available therefore, in each calendar year in which dividends are paid on the
Company's Class A Common Stock, at a differential of $.01 per share, each
calendar year more than the dividends paid in such a year on Class A Common
Stock.  The owners of both Class A and Class B Common Stock are entitled to
share pro-rata, irrespective of class, in the distribution of the Company's
available assets upon dissolution.

Owners of Class B Common Stock are entitled to elect, as a class, one member of
the Company's Board of Directors.  In addition, owners of Class B Common Stock
are entitled to full voting powers, as a class, with respect to any
consolidation, merger, sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's fixed assets, or
dissolution of the Company.  Otherwise, except as provided by statute with
respect to certain amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, the owners of
Class B Common Stock have no voting rights, and the entire voting power is
vested in the Class A Common Stock, which has one vote per share.  

The owner of a share of Class A Common Stock may, at their option, at any time,
convert such share into one share of Class B Common Stock.  All Class A Common
Stock surrended for conversion will be cancelled and retired permanently.

If cash dividends are not paid on shares of the Company's Common Stock for a
period of thirty-six consecutive months, or if at any time the total number of
shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding is less than 15% of the
total number of issued and outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B Common

Net income in the first quarter of 1994 was increased by $1,200,000, or $.05 per
share, due to the Company's adoption of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes.

                                     - 36 -<PAGE>

Net income in the second quarter of 1993 includes a restructuring charge of
$2,850,000, or $.13 per share, relating to the restructuring of the Company's
piano operations in Europe.

Net income in the fourth quarter of 1993 was reduced by $911,000, or $.04 per
share, relating to the Company's year-end inventory valuation, in part due to
the inflationary impact of LIFO costs being higher at year-end than had been
forecast during interim periods.

Net income in the first quarter of 1992 includes a nonoperating gain of
$1,228,000, or $.06 per share, relating to insurance proceeds from an accidental
fire that destroyed the Chandler Veneers plant.

Net income in the fourth quarter of 1992 was improved $647,000, or $.03 per
share, due to a downward adjustment of the LIFO inventory reserve.  The
adjustment resulted from inventory quantities and cost at year-end being lower
than was forecast.  In addition, net income in the fourth quarter of 1992 was
also improved $401,000, or $.02 per share, due to an inventory adjustment
resulting, in part, from certain LIFO cost estimates used to charge costs out of
inventory being higher than actual costs.

Effective June 30, 1994, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.  Under the new rules, the Company's debt securities are classified
as held-to-maturity securities.  The Company's Other Investments consist of
investments in limited partnership interests in hedged debt and equity
securities.  The new accounting rules are consistent with the Company's
prevailing accounting policy and, consequently, do not effect the Company's
current earnings, financial position, or cash flow.

The Company has the positive intent and financial ability to hold all securities
classified as held-to-maturity until their contractual maturity dates. 
Discounts and premiums are amortized over the life of the security.  Unrealized
holding gains and (losses) were $113,000 and $(128,000) at June 30, 1994, and
$318,000 and $(15,000) at June 30, 1993, respectively.  Fair values are
estimated based upon the quoted market values of those, or similar instruments. 
All held-to-maturity securities mature within a period of 0-14 months.

NOTE 15.  BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION:

The Company has three business segments which are as follows:

Furniture and Cabinets:  Sales include office, lodging and home furniture;
television and stereo cabinets; pianos and piano cases, keys and actions; and
other miscellaneous products.  Intersegment sales are insignificant.

Electronic Contract Assemblies:  Sales include electronic and electro-mechanical
products (electronic assemblies) manufactured on a contract basis to customers'
specifications.  There are no intersegment sales.

Processed Wood Products and Other:  Processed Wood Products include the sales of
lumber, lumber banded particleboard, dimension lumber, plywood, veneer, and
other sales.  "Other" sales include plastic components, carbide cutting tools
and related services on cutting tools, fleet and automotive services, and other
miscellaneous products and services, totaling approximately 22% in 1994, 21% in
1993, and 25% in 1992, of the total customer sales of this segment. 
Intersegment sales include these same basic wood products, assembled components
and miscellaneous products, which are used in the final production of pianos,
cabinets, office, home, hospitality and healthcare furniture; thus, intersegment
sales consist of sales to the Furniture and Cabinets segment.

Total United States sales by geographic area includes export sales of, in
millions, $18.4 in 1994, $18.2 in 1993, and $17.1 in 1992.  Included in the
Electronic Contract Assemblies segment are sales to three customers which
account for 22%, 21% and 18% of consolidated net sales in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  One customer accounts for 11.9% of consolidated net sales in
1994, 12.4% in 1993, and 10.8% in 1992.  Foreign customer sales are generally to
European customers.  The eliminations from operating income are various
transactions including intercompany profit in inventories.  Identifiable assets
eliminated generally consist of intercompany profit in inventories and
intercompany accounts receivable.

Intersegment sales are generally priced at cost plus a percentage mark-up, and
are generally thought to be marginally less than prices which would be charged
for the same product to unaffiliated customers.

                 this Article V)

     (b)  30,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock of the par value of $.31-1/4
                 per share.

     Section 2.     Changes and Reclassifications.  At the time that this
amendment becomes effective [which was November 6, 1987], and without any
further action on the part of the corporation or its shareholders, each share of
Class A Common Stock, $.62-1/2 par value, then issued (including shares held by
the corporation as treasury shares), shall be changed and reclassified into two
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock, $.31-1/4 par value
per share, and each share of Class B Common Stock, $.62-1/2 par value, then
issued (including shares held by the corporation as treasury shares), shall be
changed and reclassified into two fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class
B Common Stock, $.31-1/4 par value per share.  To reflect the change and
reclassification provided above, each certificate representing shares of Class A
Common Stock, $.62-1/2 par value, theretofore issued and outstanding or
theretofore issued and held in the corporate treasury, and each certificate
representing shares of Class B Common Stock, $.62-1/2 par value, theretofore
issued and outstanding or theretofore issued and held in the corporate treasury,
shall continue to represent, after the effective date of this amendment, the
same number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock,
respectively, theretofore represented by such certificate, and each holder of
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock shall be entitled, as
soon as practicable after the effective date of this amendment, to receive a new
certificate representing a number of shares of Class A Common Stock, $.31-1/4
par value, or Class B Common Stock, $.31-1/4 par value, respectively as
authorized by this
                                                                    Exhibit 3(a)
                                     - 52 -<PAGE>

amendment, equal to the number of shares theretofore held so that, upon this
amendment becoming effective, each holder of record of a certificate theretofore
representing issued Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock will be
entitled to certificates representing in the aggregate two shares of Class A
Common Stock, $.31-1/4 par value, or Class B Common Stock, $.31-1/4 par value,
respectively, for each share of Class A Common Stock, $.62-1/2 par value, or
Class B Common Stock, $.62-1/2 par value, respectively, of which the shareholder
was the holder prior to the effectiveness of this amendment.

     Section 3.     Terms.  The relative rights, preferences, limitations and
restrictions of each class of shares of Common Stock are as follows:

     (a)     Dividends.  
     The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be
     entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, from
     funds lawfully available therefor, all dividends payable in cash or other
     property of the corporation, and for this purpose Class A Common Stock and
     Class B Common Stock shall be considered as one class, and the holders
     thereof shall be entitled to participate ratably, share for share, and
     without preference of either class over the other, in all dividends so
     declared and paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of Class B
     Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends in each fiscal year of
     the corporation in an amount which is $.01 per share (the "Differential")
     greater than the amount of dividends which are paid on the Class A Common
     Stock in such year; provided, however, that 

             (i)     if any such fiscal year shall consist of less than 360
     days, then the Differential shall be equal to $.01 per share multiplied by
     a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole calendar months
     in such fiscal year, and the denominator of which is twelve;

             (ii)    with respect to the first fiscal year ending after the date
     this amendment becomes effective, the Differential shall be equal to $.01
     per share multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
     of whole calendar months between the date this amendment becomes effective
     and the end of such fiscal year, and the denominator which is twelve; and

             (iii)     in the event of a split or division of the outstanding
     shares of Class B Common Stock into more shares of that class, or a
     combination of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock into a
     lesser number of shares of that class, or the declaration and payment of a
     stock dividend payable in shares of Class B Common Stock on the
     outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, then, effective upon the
     effectiveness of such split, division or combination, or upon the payment
     of such stock dividend, as the case may be, the Differential shall be
     adjusted to $.01 per share multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
     which is the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the effectiveness of such split, division or
     combination, or the payment of such stock dividend, as the case may be,
     and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class B Common
     Stock outstanding immediately following such split, division or
     combination, or the payment of such stock dividend, as the case may be.

             All per share computations under clauses (i) and (ii) of this
     Section 3(a) shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent and all
     payments to a holder of Class B Common Stock on any payment date with
     respect to all shares of Class B Common Stock held by such holder shall be
     rounded to the nearest whole cent.

             No stock dividend may be declared or paid on the outstanding shares
     of any class of Common Stock unless payable in shares of that class and no
     stock dividend may be declared or paid on the outstanding shares of any
     class of Common Stock unless, at the same time, a stock dividend, at the
     same rate, is declared and paid on the outstanding shares of each class of
     Common Stock, payable in shares of that class.  The outstanding shares of
     any class of 
                                                                    Exhibit 3(a)
                                     - 53 -<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     Common Stock shall not be split or divided into more shares of that class,
     or combined into a lesser number of shares of that class, unless, at the
     same time, the outstanding shares of each class of Common Stock are
     similarly split, divided or combined.

     (b)     Voting.  Except as otherwise provided in this Article V and except
as otherwise required by law, the voting power of the corporation shall vest in
the holders of Class A Common Stock, the holder of each issued and outstanding
share of Class A Common Stock being entitled to one vote in person or by proxy
for each such share, on all matters requiring the vote of shareholders, and the
holders of Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled by reason of their
holdings thereof to any voice or vote in the management or affairs of the
corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of Class B Common Stock
at any time issued and outstanding shall be entitled, as a class, (i) elect, at
each meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected, one member of the
Board of Directors of the corporation but shall not be entitled to vote upon the
election of the remaining members of the Board of Directors of the corporation,
and (ii) to full voting powers at any meeting of the shareholders of the
corporation with respect to any proposed amendment to this Article V or with
respect to any consolidation, merger, sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or
other disposition of all or substantially all of its fixed assets, or the
dissolution of the corporation.  In addition to the foregoing, the express terms
and provisions of any class of Common Stock shall not be changed without the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of such class of Common Stock.

     (c)     Conversion.  Any record holder of shares of Class A Common Stock
shall be entitled, at any time or from time to time, to convert any or all of
such shares held by such holder into the same number of shares of Class B Common
Stock.  A record holder desiring to effect the conversion of shares of Class A
Common Stock into shares of Class B Common Stock shall furnish the corporation
with (i) a signed written notice of the intended conversion, stating that such
record holder desires to convert such shares of Class A Common Stock into the
same number of shares of Class B Common Stock and requesting that the
corporation issue all of such shares of Class B Common Stock to such holder, and
(ii) the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class A Common
Stock to be converted, in proper form for transfer.  All Class A Common Stock
surrendered for conversion hereunder shall be cancelled and retired permanently
and shall not be reissued.

     (d)     Dissolution.  The Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
shall participate equally per share in all distributions of assets of the
corporation upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution.

     (e)     Elimination of the Foregoing Provisions.  If, at any time, the
number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock shall constitute
less than 15% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock then issued and outstanding or the corporation shall not
have paid any dividends on the Class B Common Stock for a period of thirty-six
consecutive calendar months, then thereupon, all of the rights, preferences,
limitations and restrictions set forth in this Section 3 relating to Class B
Common Stock shall become the same as the rights, preferences, limitations and
restrictions of the Class A Common Stock provided for herein, without any
further action on the part of the corporation or its shareholders, and all
distinctions between Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall
thereupon and thereby be eliminated, so that all shares of Class B Common Stock
shall be equal to shares of Class A Common Stock with respect to all matters,
including without limitation, dividend payments and voting rights and all
holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall vote as
a single class (except as otherwise required by applicable law) on all matters
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the corporation; provided, however,
the right and power to convert any shares of Class A Common Stock into shares of
Class B Common Stock shall continue and, upon written request from the
corporation to all holders of Class A Common Stock, such holders shall promptly
take such steps as shall be necessary to convert the shares of Class A Common
Stock held by such holders into shares of Class B Common Stock.
                                                                    Exhibit 3(a)

             at pleasure.

     (b)     The shares of this corporation may be issued by the corporation for

     (e)     The Board of Directors of the corporation shall have power, without
             the assent or vote of the shareholders, to make, alter, amend or
             repeal the Code by By-laws of the corporation, but the affirmative
             vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors for the
             time being, shall be necessary to effect any alteration, amendment
             or repeal.

     (f)     The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, or
             repeal any provisions contained in these Articles of Incorporation
             in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the provisions of the
             Indiana General Corporation Act, or any other pertinent enactment
             of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana; and all rights and
             powers conferred hereby on shareholders, directors and/or officers
             are subject to this reserve power.

     (g)     No contract or other transaction between this corporation and any
             one or more members of the Board of Directors, or between this
             corporation and another corporation, firm, partnership, joint
             venture, trust or other enterprise of which any one or more such
             interested members are directors, officers, shareholders, partners,
             members, employees or agents or in which any one or more such
             interested members are financially interested, shall be void or
             voidable because of such relationship or 

                                                                    Exhibit 3(a)

             interest or because such interested member or members are present
             at the meeting of the Board of Directors at which such contract or
             transaction is authorized or approved or because such interested
             member's or members' votes are counted for such purposes, if (1)
             the fact of such relationship or interest is disclosed or known to
             the disinterested members of the Board of Directors who authorize,
             approve or ratify such contract or transaction by a vote or consent
             sufficient for the purpose without counting the votes of such
             interested member or members of the Board of Directors, or (2) the
             fact of such relationship or interest is disclosed or known to the
             holders of shares of this corporation and such holders authorize,
             approve or ratify such contract or transaction by a vote or consent
             sufficient for the purpose, or (3) such contract or transaction is
             fair and reasonable insofar as this corporation is concerned. Such
             interested member or members of the Board of Directors may be
             counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the
             Board of Directors at which such contract or transaction is
             authorized, approved or ratified.  This paragraph (g) shall not be

     (h)     It is intended that this corporation may acquire and own wasting
             assets or property having a limited life.  The depletion of such
             assets by sale, lapse of time or otherwise need not be deducted in
             the computation or surplus available for dividends.

     (i)     Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
             Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without
             a meeting, if prior to such action the written consent thereto is
             signed by all members of the Board or of such committee, as the
             case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of
             the proceedings of the Board of committee.

     No share shall be voted at any meeting:

     (1)  Upon which an installment is due and unpaid; or

                                                                    Exhibit 3(b)

     stockholders of record on the record date fixed by the Board of Directors

     as the instrument or order appointing such fiduciaries may direct.  In the
     absence of any such direction or the inability of the fiduciaries to act in
     accordance therewith, shares held jointly by three (3) or more fiduciaries
     shall be voted in accordance with the will of the majority and, where the
     fiduciaries or a majority of them cannot agree or where they are equally
     divided upon the questions of voting such shares, any Court of general
     equity jurisdiction may, upon petition filed by any of such fiduciaries or
     by any party in interest, direct the voting of such shares as it may deem
     for the best interest of the beneficiaries, and such shares shall be voted
     in accordance with such direction.  Shares that are pledged may, unless
     otherwise provided in the agreement of pledge, be voted by the stockholder
     pledging the same until the shares have been transferred to the pledgee on
     the books of the corporation, and, thereafter, they may be voted by the
     pledgee.

     Section 7 - Voting Lists:  The officer or agent having charge of the stock
     transfer book shall make, at least five (5) days before each election of
     directors, a complete list of the stockholders arranged in alphabetical
     order with the address and number of shares held by each, which list shall
     be on file at the principal office of the corporation and subject to
     inspection by any stockholder.  Such list shall be produced and kept open
     at the time and place of election and subject to the inspection of any
     stockholder during the holding of such election.  The original stock
     register or transfer book, or a duplicate thereof kept in the State of
     Indiana, shall be the only evidence as to who are the stock-

     Directors so empowering such officer or non-officer employees.  Any such
     written designation may be revoked at any time by the Chairman of the
     Board, the President, or the Chief Executive Officer, and, in their absence

ARTICLE XIV:  INDEMNIFICATION

Section 1 - Every person (and the heirs, executors and administrators of such
person) who is or was a director or officer of this corporation or of any
subsidiary of this corporation or who, at the request of the Board of Directors
of this corporation, served in any position or capacity or on any committee for
this corporation or for or in any other corporation, partnership, association,
trust, foundation, not-for-profit corporation, employee benefit plan or other
organization or entity, shall be indemnified by the corporation against any and
all liability and reasonable expense that may be incurred by him in connection
with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding in which either (i)
such person is wholly successful, thereby entitling such person to Mandatory
Indemnification, or (ii) such person is not wholly successful but it is
nevertheless determined, pursuant to the procedures set forth below in Section 2
of this Article XIV of these By-laws, that such person acted in good faith and
that such person reasonably believed that (a) in the case of conduct in his
official capacity, his conduct was in the corporation's best interests, or (b)
in all other cases, his conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests
of such corporation, entity or organization, and, in addition with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, either had reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful, thereby entitling such person to Permissive Indemnification.  A person
shall be considered to have been serving an employee benefit plan at the request
of the corporation if his duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or
otherwise involve services by, him to the plan or to participants in or
beneficiaries of the plan.  The terms "claim", "action", "suit" or "proceeding"
shall mean and include any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit
or proceeding (whether brought by or in the right of the corporation of any
other corporation or otherwise), and all appeals thereof, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, formal or informal, in which any
person described in the first sentence of this section may become involved as a
party or otherwise:

(a) by reason of his being or having been a director or officer of the
    corporation, or of any subsidiary corporation of the corporation, or of any
    other corporation where he served as such at the request of the corporation,
    or 

(b) by reason of his acting or having acted in any position or capacity or on
    any committee for this corporation or any subsidiary corporation of this
    corporation, or in any

                                                                    Exhibit 3(b)
                                     - 69 -<PAGE>
<PAGE>
    position or capacity in or for a partnership, association, trust,
    foundation, not-for-profit corporation, employee benefit plan or other
    organization or entity where he served as such at the request of the
    corporation, or 

(c) by reason of any action taken or not taken by him in any such capacity,
    whether or not he continues in such capacity at the time such liability or
    expense shall have been incurred.

The terms "liability" and "expenses" shall include, but shall not be limited to,
counsel fees and disbursements and amounts of judgements, fines or penalties
against, and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of, a person, and excise
taxes assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, but shall not in any
event include any liability or expenses on account of profits realized by him in
the purchase or sale of securities of the corporation.  The term "wholly
successful" shall mean (a) termination of any action, suit or proceeding against
the person in question without any finding of liability or guilt against him,
(b) the expiration of a reasonable period of time after the making of any claim
or threat of an action, suit or proceeding without the institution of the same,
without any payment or promise made to induce a settlement, or (c) approval by a
court, with knowledge of the indemnity herein provided, of a settlement of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding.  The termination of any claim, action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court
approval), or conviction or upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or its
equivalent, shall not by itself create a presumption that a person did not meet
the standards of conduct for Permissive Indemnification.  The actions of a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be deemed to have been taken in
what the person reasonably believed to be the best interests of the corporation
if the person reasonably believed he was acting in conformity with the
requirements of such Act or he reasonably believed his actions to be in the
interests of the participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.

Section 2 - With regard to Permissive Indemnification, the determination that a
person acted in good faith and that such person reasonably believed that (a) in
the case of conduct in his official capacity, his conduct was in the
corporation's best interests, or (b) in all other cases, his conduct was at
least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, in addition,

proceeding in or as to which such person is not wholly successful shall be made
by or for the Board of Directors of the corporation in the manner herinafter
described.  Any requests for such indemnification must first be proposed to the
Board of Directors of the corporation, and a motion for such indemnification may
be made by any director of the corporation, including a director who is seeking
such indemnification for himself.  If a quorum of directors eligible to decide 
the matter exists within the limitations and requirements of I.C. 23-1-37-12 (b)
(1), such directors may either (i) decide the question themselves; (ii) refer
the matter to Special Legal Counsel for decision pursuant to I.C. 23-1-37-12 (b)
(3) (A); or (iii) decline to take any action to either decide the question of
such indemnification or refer the matter for decision to Special Legal Counsel. 
If there does not exist a quorum of directors eligible to decide the matter
within the limitations and requirements of I.C. 23-1-37-12 (b) (1), a majority
of the entire Board of Directors may either (i) refer the matter to a committee
of two or more directors who are eligible to vote thereon pursuant to I.C.
23-1-37-12 (b) (2) who may either decide the matter themselves or refer the
matter to Special Legal Counsel for decision pursuant to I.C. 23-1-37-12 (b) (3)
(A); (ii) if such a committee cannot be appointed, refer the matter to Special
Legal Counsel pursuant to the procedures described in I.C. 23-1-37-12 (b) (3)
(B); or (iii) decline to take any action to refer the matter of such
indemnification to a committee or to Special Legal Counsel.  Any decision on the
question of entitlement to such Permissive Indemnification by a majority of a
quorum of the Board of Directors eligible to vote pursuant to I.C. 23-1-37-12
(b) (1); by a special committee of eligible directors pursuant to I.C.
23-1-37-12 (b) (2); or by Special Legal Counsel duly appointed pursuant to the
provisions of I.C. 23-1-37-12 (b) (3), shall be in the sole and absolute
discretion of such person or persons who are to make such determination.  If it
is determined and decided that such Permissive Indemnification should be given
in a specific situation, the authorization for such indemnification and a
determination of the amount thereof shall be made in accordance with the
procedures and requirements of I. C. 23-1-37-12 (c).  For purposes of this
Section 2, Permissive Indemnification shall be deemed to have been denied (i) if
a majority of any group of persons who are to decide the question do not vote in
favor of the proposed indemnification; (ii) if the Board of Directors or any 
committee thereof declines to take any permitted action to either decide the
question, refer it to a committee, or refer it to Special Legal Counsel; (iii)
if no decision is made by the person or persons who were to decide such question
within a period of six (6) months after such indemnification was first proposed
to the Board of Directors of the corporation; or (iv) to the extent that the
dollar amount of any indemnification to be made by the corporation is less than
the total dollar amount of indemnification proposed or requested to be made.  If
proposed

                                                                    Exhibit 3(b)
                                     - 71 -<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Permissive Indemnification is denied, the question may not be reconsidered at
any subsequent time by the corporation.

Section 3 - Expenses incurred with respect to any claim, action, suit or
proceeding may be advanced by the corporation (by action of the Board of
Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists) prior to the final
disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the 
recipient to repay such amount unless he is entitled to indemnification under
this Article of these By-laws.

Section 4 - The rights of mandatory and Permissive Indemnification provided in
this Article of the By-laws shall be in addition to any rights to which any such
person may otherwise be entitled by contract, as matter of law, or pursuant to
I.C. 23-1-37.  Any person claiming the right to indemnification pursuant to any
provisions of these By-laws may at any time apply for indemnification to or seek
review of any decision denying indemnification or determining the amount thereof
by a court pursuant to I.C. 23-1-37-11.  Persons who are not directors or
officers of the corporation but who are directors or officers of any subsidiary
may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by
the Board of Directors.

Section 5 - Irrespective of the provisions of this Article of the By-laws, the
Board of Directors may, at any time or from time to time, approve
indemnification of directors and officers or other persons to the full extent
permitted by the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law at the time
in effect, whether on account of past or future transactions.

Section 6 - To the extent not inconsistent with Indiana law as in effect from
time to time, the Board of Directors may, at any time or from time to time,
approve the purchase and maintenance of insurance on behalf of any person
described in the first sentence of Section 1 of this Article XIV against any
liability asserted against him in his capacity or arising out of his status as
such a person, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
him under the provisions of this Article of the By-laws.  In the event that any
expense or liability otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder is covered
entirely or in part by any insurance, the indemnification provided for by this
Article of these By-laws shall only be available, if at all, as to any uninsured
liability or expense or that portion which is in excess of the amount of all
available insurance coverage.  Under no circumstances shall any insurer or other
person making payment under such an insurance policy or contract be subrogated
to the

                                                                    Exhibit 3(b)

<PAGE>
rights of any person entitled to indemnification under this Article of these
By-laws.

Section 7 - Any and all references contained in Article XIV of these By-laws to
any provision, section, subsection or portion of the Indiana Code (I.C.) shall
mean the Indiana Code as the same existed on December 9, 1986, and no subsequent
amendment, repeal, modification, change, or judicial invalidation of any
provision of the Indiana Code subsequent to December 9, 1986, shall alter,
modify, or otherwise affect these By-laws, and these By-laws shall be construed
and interpreted under the statutory law of the State of Indiana as it existed as
of the date of adoption of these By-laws.

Section 8 - The indemnification herein required or permitted by these amended
indemnification By-laws shall be a contractual obligation, undertaking and
commitment of the corporation as to any person who either continued to serve or
commenced to serve, following the date of the adoption of these amended
indemnification By-laws, as a director or officer of this corporation or any
subsidiary of this corporation, or in any other position or capacity, at the
request of this corporation or any subsidiary corporation, on any committee,
partnership, association, trust, foundation, not-for-profit corporation,
employee benefit, plan, or other organization or entity, and no subsequent
amendment or repeal of these By-laws and no judicial decision invalidating the
legislation authorizing the indemnification provided for by these By-laws or
invalidating all or any part of these indemnification By-laws shall in any
manner deny, diminish, limit, restrict, or qualify the indemnification herein
provided for, for any such person who so continued to serve or commenced to
serve with regard to any claim concerning any matter which occurred, which
commenced to occur, or which continued to occur subsequent to the adoption of
these amended indemnification By-laws and prior to any such amendment, repeal,
or judicial invalidation.

Sharing Bonus Plan, including provision for forfeitures.
