          Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the number of
   the Company's various facilities set forth in this Form 10-K Annual Report
   are as of the date of the Company's 1994 fiscal year-end, May 26, 1994.

   Item 1. Business.

          The Marcus Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively referred
   to herein as the "Company") are engaged in four business segments: 
   motels; hotels and resorts; restaurants; and movie theatres.  The Company
   began in 1935 as the operator of a single movie theatre and currently
   owns, operates or franchises 99 motels, five hotels, one resort, 68
   restaurants, and 36 movie theatres with an aggregate of 189 screens.

          The Company's motel operations include a chain of 98 Budgetel Inn
   economy motels in 26 states and one Woodfield Suites all-suite motel in
   Wisconsin.  Of the 98 Budgetel Inns, 76 are owned or operated by the
   Company and 22 are franchised.  

          The Company's hotel and resort operations include The Pfister and
   the Marc Plaza, full-service hotels in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin
   metropolitan area, and The Grand Geneva Resort & Spa, a full-facility
   destination resort in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.  The Company also operates
   or manages three hotels, the Sheraton Mayfair Inn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
   The Mead Inn in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, and the Crowne-Plaza
   Northstar in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

          The Company's restaurant division includes 35 KFC (Kentucky Fried
   Chicken) restaurants in Wisconsin; four Marc's Big Boy restaurants in
   Wisconsin and Minnesota; 13 Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mill restaurants in
   Wisconsin; 13 Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar ("Applebee's")
   restaurants in Wisconsin and Illinois; two Big Boy Express restaurants in
   Wisconsin; and one Original Gino's East of Chicago Restaurant in
   Wisconsin.

          The Company operates 36 movie theatres with an aggregate of 189
   screens throughout Wisconsin and in northern Illinois.

   Business Segment Data

          Set forth below is certain business segment data for the Company's
   three most recent fiscal years relating to the Company's four industry
   segments.  As a result of the substantial expansion of the Company's hotel
   and resort operations in fiscal 1994 and the increasingly different
   operating characteristics of the Company's hotels and resort from the
   Company's motels, the Company has commenced separate business segment
   reporting for its hotel and resort division and its motel division and has
   restated retroactively the following segment reporting information
   accordingly.  Intersegment sales and transfers are not material.

   Motel Operations 

   Budgetel Inns

            The Company owns, operates or franchises 98 economy motels, with
   over 10,000 rooms, under the name "Budgetel Inn" in 26 states.  The
   Company operates 22 Budgetel Inns through franchisees.  The remaining
   Budgetel Inns are either Company-owned (68) or operated under joint
   venture agreements (eight).

          Targeted at the business traveler, Budgetel Inns feature an
   upscale, contemporary exterior appearance, are generally located in high
   traffic commercial areas in close proximity to interstate highway exits
   and major thoroughfares and typically vary in size between 60 and 150
   rooms.  Budgetel Inn daily room rates generally vary between $30 and $45
   per night.  

          The Company believes that providing amenities not typically
   associated with economy-priced motels help distinguish Budgetel Inns from
   many of its competitors. These amenities include executive conference
   centers, room-delivered complimentary continental breakfasts, king-sized
   beds, free local telephone calls and incoming fax transmissions, no
   smoking rooms, in-room coffeemakers and hair dryers, remote control cable
   televisions, extra-long telephone cords and large working desks.  To
   enhance customer security, the Company has converted all of its Company-
   owned and most of its franchised Budgetel Inn rooms to "card key" locking
   systems and provides well-lighted parking areas and all night front desk
   staffing.  The interior of each Budgetel Inn is refurbished in accordance
   with a strict periodic schedule.  

          Budgetel Inns operates a nationwide guest reservation center, where
   travelers can call 1-800-4-BUDGET toll-free to obtain Budgetel Inn room
   reservations and other information.

          The Company has a national franchise program for its Budgetel Inns.
   Franchisees pay an initial franchise fee and annual marketing assessments,
   reservation system assessments and royalty fees based on room revenues. 
   To facilitate continued growth in Budgetel Inn franchising, the Company
   offers certain financial assistance plans to its franchisees.  The Company
   is qualified to sell, and anticipates ultimately selling, franchises in
   all 50 states. 

          During fiscal 1994, five new Company-owned units opened and one
   franchised unit was opened.  Since the end of fiscal 1994, two new
   Company-owned Budgetel Inns have opened, with an additional five new
   Company-owned and two new franchised units under various stages of
   construction.  Depending upon continuing favorable industry conditions and
   other factors, the Company currently plans to add a substantial number of
   new Budgetel Inns over the next five fiscal years through internal
   expansion, franchising and acquisition.  

   Woodfield Suites

          The Company operates a mid-priced, all-suite motel under the name
   "Woodfield Suites" and plans to open two more Woodfield Suites in fiscal
   1995 using its new prototype all-suites motel design.  Woodfield Suites
   offers all of its guests the use of its centrally-located swimming pool,
   whirlpool and game room.  Each suite has a bedroom and separate living
   room and features an extra-length bed, sleeper sofa for additional guests,
   microwave, refrigerator, wet bar, television and hair dryer. Some suites
   also have a kitchenette. All guests receive a free continental breakfast
   and are invited to a free cocktail hour. 

   Hotel and Resort Operations

   The Pfister Hotel  

          The Company owns and operates The Pfister Hotel, a 307-room, full
   service luxury hotel, in downtown Milwaukee.  In fiscal 1994, The Pfister
   Hotel earned its 18th consecutive four-diamond award from the American
   Automobile Association.  The Pfister is also a member of the Preferred
   Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Association, an organization of independent
   luxury hotels and resorts, and the Association of Historic Hotels of
   America.

          In 1988, The Pfister Hotel initiated a five-year exterior and
   interior restoration and refurbishment plan which was completed prior to
   May 1993, when The Pfister celebrated its centennial anniversary.  The
   renovation and centennial celebration contributed to increased occupancy
   levels in fiscal 1994.

   The Marc Plaza Hotel  

          The Company owns and operates the 500-room Marc Plaza Hotel,
   located in downtown Milwaukee.  The Company leases office suites on two
   floors of The Marc Plaza to professional and other business tenants on a
   short- to intermediate-term basis and provides such tenants with various
   secretarial and other office-type services.

          As a result of the planned opening of a new and expanded municipal
   convention center adjacent to the Marc Plaza, the Company will commence
   work on a major refurbishment of the Marc Plaza's existing facilities in
   November 1994, with completion targeted for May 1995.  Additionally, the
   Marc Plaza plans to add an additional 250 rooms.  

   The Grand Geneva Resort & Spa  

          In July 1993, the Company acquired the Americana Lake Geneva Resort
   in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and renamed it the Grand Geneva Resort & Spa. 
   Originally opened in 1968, the Grand Geneva Resort & Spa is a full-
   facility destination resort located on 1,300 acres.  The resort includes
   355 guest rooms, a convention center, three speciality restaurants, two
   championship golf courses, several ski-hills, indoor tennis courts, a
   fitness and sports complex, horse stables and an on-site airport.  The
   resort was closed by the Company in September 1993 for a complete
   renovation and reopened in May 1994.

   Operated and Managed Hotels

          The Company operates the 150-room Sheraton Mayfair Inn in the
   Milwaukee metropolitan area under a operating agreement which expires in
   April 1995.  The Company is currently evaluating the economic feasibility
   of renewing this operating agreement and may enter into negotiations to
   continue its operation of the Sheraton Mayfair Inn if the proposed
   economic terms and conditions indicate that such a renewal would be in the
   best interests of the Company. 

          The Company manages the 226-room Crowne Plaza - Northstar in
   Minneapolis, Minnesota pursuant to a 15-year management agreement. 
   Formerly known as the Northstar Hotel, the property was substantially
   remodeled in early 1994 and renamed the Crowne Plaza-Northstar, the luxury
   brand of the Holiday Inn system.

          The Company also manages the 154-room Mead Inn in Wisconsin Rapids,
   Wisconsin, pursuant to a 15-year management agreement, with the Company
   having an option to extend the term of the agreement for three successive
   five-year periods.  

   Restaurant Operations 

          The restaurant division operates facilities under a number of
   different restaurant concepts and the Company is continually trying to
   position its restaurants in order to best respond to changing consumer
   tastes and preferences.  These efforts include closing or selling less
   profitable locations, converting them into different concepts or
   remodeling them.  The Company's current principal emphasis is on casual-
   theme dining, as evidenced through the Company's continuing expansion of
   its successful Applebee's facilities.  The Company also actively considers
   developing or being the franchisee for new restaurant concepts.  At the
   close of fiscal 1994, the Company operated 13 Applebee's Neighborhood
   Grill & Bars, 35 KFCs, 13 Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mills, four Marc's Big
   Boys, two Big Boy Expresses and one Original Gino's East of Chicago.  

   KFC Restaurants

          The Company has non-exclusive franchise rights to operate KFC
   restaurants in the Milwaukee metropolitan area and in northeast Wisconsin. 
   The Company has operated KFC restaurants for 34 years.  The Company
   currently operates 35 KFC restaurants and is the largest operator of KFC
   restaurants in Wisconsin, based on the number of facilities operated.  The
   restaurants feature Kentucky Fried Chicken and other franchisor-authorized
   food items, including the introduction of the new Colonel's Rotisserie
   Gold non-fried chicken in fiscal 1994.

          In 1988, the KFC franchisor, Pepsico, Inc., began efforts to change
   the KFC dining concept from providing facilities with only carryout
   services ("carryout stores") to providing facilities with carryout, drive-
   thru and sit-down service ("KFC restaurants").  In response to these
   efforts, the Company has renovated, rebuilt or renovated 32 of its 35
   carryout stores into KFC restaurants, providing virtually all new
   facilities with inside seating for approximately 40 customers, drive-thru
   windows and updated electronic equipment to better facilitate food
   preparation and order processing.  In fiscal 1994, the Company replaced
   two carryout units with new KFC restaurants in Milwaukee.  The Company
   plans to build two or three new KFC's in late fiscal 1995.  

   Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar Restaurants

          The Company has the exclusive franchise rights to develop and
   operate Applebee's restaurants in the Chicago metropolitan area and
   surrounding counties and for substantially all of Wisconsin.  The
   Applebee's restaurant system is franchised by Applebee's International,
   Inc., a publicly-held company headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri.  A
   majority of the restaurants in the Applebee's system are operated by
   franchisees, such as the Company.  The Company owns and operates 13
   Applebee's, including four in the Milwaukee metropolitan area, two in
   Madison, Wisconsin, one in Appleton, Wisconsin, and six in the Chicago
   metropolitan area.  During early fiscal 1995, the Company opened three new
   units, one in Green Bay, Wisconsin and two in Illinois.  The Company has
   seven additional Applebee's in various stages of development in Wisconsin
   and in the Chicago metropolitan area.  The Company plans to open a total
   of six to eight Applebee's in fiscal 1995.

          Applebee's restaurants are local neighborhood establishments, with
   a comfortable and casual atmosphere appealing to all ages.  Menu items
   consisting of beef, chicken, seafood and pasta entrees prepared in a
   variety of cuisines include traditional favorites and innovative dishes,
   in addition to a full range of appetizers and snack foods.  The Company's
   Applebee's restaurants generally have about 35 to 40 tables and seat
   approximately 165 customers, with a centrally located bar.

   Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mill Restaurants

          The Company owns and operates 13 Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mill
   restaurants.  Renovated from former Big Boy restaurants, the updated decor
   in each Marc's Cafe includes brass, greenery, rich upholstery and warm,
   relaxing colors.  Local memorabilia decorate the walls for a hometown
   touch in each facility.  Marc's Cafes are intended to provide customers
   with a casual, intimate atmosphere, with menus featuring, among other
   items, freshly-brewed specialty coffees, rotisserie chicken, beer and
   wine.  Operating in a highly competitive segment of the restaurant
   industry, the Company continues to examine alternatives and refinements to
   this internally-developed restaurant concept.  

   Marc's Big Boy Restaurants/Big Boy Express

          The Company operates four Marc's Big Boy restaurants and has non-
   exclusive franchise rights to operate restaurants under the "Big Boy" name
   in Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa and exclusive rights in Minnesota.  In
   response to changing consumer tastes and preferences, the Company has
   closed, sold or converted 54 of its former Big Boy restaurants over the
   last six years in order to focus on more promising locations and
   restaurant concepts. The Company expects to ultimately close or convert
   all of its remaining Marc's Big Boy locations as appropriate alternatives
   arise.

          The Company operates two Big Boy Express double drive-thru,
   carryout restaurants in metropolitan Milwaukee, designed with a 1950s art
   deco motif.  Intended as a test concept, Big Boy Express features outdoor
   patio seating and enclosed walk-up windows and serves the "Big Boy"
   doubledecker hamburger sandwich, other sandwiches, french fries and
   milkshakes.  The Company continues to evaluate the potential long-term
   feasibility of this concept.

   The Original Gino's East of Chicago Restaurants

          In September 1993, the Company acquired exclusive franchise rights
   to operate Original Gino's East of Chicago restaurants in Wisconsin,
   Minnesota, Iowa and selected sights in Illinois.  Gino's East specializes
   in Chicago-style (deep dish) pizza, together with pasta, salads,
   sandwiches and Italian cuisine.  In fiscal 1994, the Company opened a
   Gino's East restaurant in Milwaukee.

   Restaurant Franchise Agreements

          The Company's restaurant franchise agreements impose various
   specifications as to the preparation of the franchised products as well as
   general operating procedures, including advertising, maintenance of
   records and protection of trademarks.  Such agreements also provide, among
   other things, for inspection, counseling and advisory services by the
   franchisors.

          The Company's KFC locations operate under individual franchise
   agreements ranging in terms from 10 to 20 years in length.  Franchise fees
   approximate 4% of gross sales and, in addition, an initial flat fee of
   $20,000 is payable for each new KFC restaurant.  The KFC franchise
   arrangement has been, and is expected to continue to be, material to the
   success of the Company's restaurant division.

          The Company's Big Boy franchise agreement provides for payment of a
   franchise fee of 1% of gross sales.  The Big Boy franchise is non-
   exclusive and continues in perpetuity, provided the Company complies with
   the conditions of the franchise agreement, which relate primarily to
   operating procedures and use of trademarks.  The Company's exclusive
   franchise rights in Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa terminated as of August
   1, 1994 as a result of the Company not maintaining a specified minimum
   number of Big Boys in the franchise area.  Given the Company's deemphasis
   of the Big Boy concept, the Company does not believe this change in its
   franchise rights impacts adversely its restaurant operations.

          The Company's development agreements with the Applebee's franchisor
   for its Chicago and Wisconsin franchise territories require the Company,
   among other things, to build a specified number of Applebee's restaurants
   in each territory in accordance with a development timetable.  The
   Applebee's franchisor charges an initial franchise fee of either $30,000
   or $35,000 (depending on location) for each Applebee's restaurant
   developed. A royalty fee of 4% of monthly gross sales is payable to the
   franchisor.  Additionally, as franchisee, the Company is required to pay
   an advertising fee to the franchisor for national advertising purposes and
   to spend certain amounts for local advertising.  Applebee's franchise
   agreements have a term of 20 years and can be renewed for an additional 20
   years.

          The Company's franchise agreement with the Gino's East franchisor
   provides for an initial franchise fee of $25,000 for each Gino's East
   franchise opened.  A royalty fee of between 3% and 7% of total gross sales
   is payable to the franchisor, depending upon individual franchise sales
   levels. The Company's master development agreement for Gino's East
   restaurants requires the Company, among other things, to open a specified
   number of Gino's East restaurants within the Company's franchised
   territory in accordance with a development schedule.

          Each of the Company's restaurant franchisors, to varying degrees,
   specify certain product requirements and provide for certain approved
   suppliers of products and supplies in order to maintain the respective
   franchise's quality standards.

   Theatre Operations

          The Company operates 36 movie theatres with an aggregate of 189
   screens in Wisconsin and northern Illinois.  The Company's facilities
   include 32 automated multi-screen theatres, three single-screen theatres
   and one outdoor twin theatre.  The Company's long-term growth strategy is
   to focus on multi-screen theatres, which typically vary in seating
   capacity from 150 to 450 seats per screen.  Multi-plex theatres allow the
   Company to offer a diversified selection of films to attract additional
   customers, to shift movies to larger or smaller auditoriums within the
   same theatre depending on the popularity of the movie and to benefit from
   the economies of having common box office, concession, projection and
   lobby facilities.  Virtually all of the Company's movie theatres feature
   exclusively first-run films.

          The results of the Company's movie theatre business (and the movie
   theatre industry in general) are largely dependent upon the box office
   appeal and marketing of available first-run films.  Stimulated in large
   part by additional demand from ancillary markets such as home video, pay-
   per-view and cable television, as well as increased demand from European
   film markets, the annual number of first-run film releases has more than
   doubled since 1981.  Over 160 first-run films were released in fiscal
   1994, including such box office hits as Mrs. Doubtfire, Philadelphia,
   Grumpy Old Men, Jurassic Park, The Firm, Schindler's List, Sleepless in
   Seattle, The Fugitive, In the Line of Fire and The Pelican Brief.  In
   fiscal 1993, approximately 150 first-run films were released.

          In fiscal 1994, the Company opened a new 10-plex theatre at Gurnee
   Mills, Illinois.  Three theatres with a total of five screens were closed
   in fiscal 1994, two of which were sold; the Company also sold one of its
   outdoor theatres.  Since the end of fiscal 1988, the number of screens in
   the Company's theatre circuit has grown by 49, representing a 35%
   increase.  In fiscal 1995, the Company anticipates opening a new eight-
   plex theatre in Delafield, Wisconsin and adding up to 11 screens to
   existing theatres.  The Company currently plans to add up to 33 additional
   screens in fiscal 1996, including additional theatres in Illinois, and to
   aggressively continue its expansion thereafter as appropriate
   opportunities arise.

          The Company obtains its films from various national motion picture
   production and distribution companies, has never experienced difficulties
   in obtaining an adequate supply of available first-run films and is not
   dependent on any one motion picture supplier.  Bookings, advertising,
   refreshment purchases and promotion are handled centrally by an
   administrative staff.

          The Company strives to provide its movie patrons with high-quality
   picture and sound presentation in clean, comfortable, attractive and
   contemporary theatre environments.  Substantially all of the Company's
   movie theatre complexes feature DTS (digital sound) Dolby stereo sound
   systems; acoustical ceilings; side wall insulation; engineered drapery
   folds to eliminate sound imbalance, reverberation and distortion; tiled
   floors; loge seats; cup-holder chair-arms; and computer-controlled
   heating, air conditioning and ventilation.  Computerized box offices
   permit most of the Company's movie theatres to sell tickets in advance and
   allow tracking of attendance by film title and time.  Most of the
   Company's theatres are fully handicapped-accessible and provide wireless
   headphones, as well as some closed-captioned films, for hearing-impaired
   moviegoers. The Company also operates an exclusive customer information
   telephone system in Milwaukee and Madison, allowing customers to call for
   information as to the locations, times and titles of movies being shown by
   the Company throughout each metropolitan area.  In fiscal 1994, the
   Company introduced digital sound systems at seven of its screens in four
   of its theatres, with additional theatres scheduled to be upgraded to
   digital sound in fiscal 1995.

          The Company sells refreshments and other concessions at all of its
   movie theatres.  The Company believes a wide variety of food and
   refreshment items, properly merchandized, increases concession revenue per
   patron.  Although popcorn still remains the traditional favorite with
   moviegoers, the Company continues to attempt to upgrade its available
   concessions by offering a wide range of choices. For example, some of the
   Company's theatres offer hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, frozen yogurt,
   coffee, mineral water, juices and dessert.

   Competition 

          All of the Company's business segments are highly competitive and
   there are other facilities in close proximity to many of the Company's
   facilities which compete directly with those of the Company.  In each of
   its businesses, the Company experiences intense competition from national
   and/or regional chain and franchise operations, some of which have
   substantially greater financial and marketing resources than the Company. 

          The Company's Budgetel Inns compete with such national economy
   motel chains as Days Inn, Hampton Inn (owned by The Promus Companies
   Incorporated), Fairfield Inn (owned by Marriott Corporation), Red Roof
   Inn, La Quinta Inn, Comfort Inn and others, as well as a large number of
   regional and local motels.

          The Company's hotels compete in the Milwaukee metropolitan area
   with the hotels operated by Hilton Hotels, Hyatt Corporation, Marriott
   Corporation, Ramada Inns, Holiday Inns and Wyndham Hotels.  The Grand
   Geneva Resort & Spa and the Company's managed and operated hotels compete
   with other hotels, motels and resorts located in proximity to such
   facilities.

          In the restaurant business, the Company's Marc's Big Boy, Marc's
   Cafe and Coffee Mill, Applebee's and Gino's East restaurants compete with
   national chains such as Denny's, Shoney's, Cracker Barrel, Perkin's, Red
   Lobster, TGI Friday's, Chili's and Olive Garden, among others, as well as
   smaller regionalized restaurant chains and individual restaurants.  The
   Company's KFC restaurants compete locally with Hardee's, Popeye's and
   similar national, as well as regional, fast food chains and individual
   restaurants offering chicken.  

          The Company's movie theatres compete with national large movie
   theatre operators, such as United Artists, Cinemark and Carmike Cinemas,
   Inc., as well as with a wide array of smaller exhibitors.  Although movie
   exhibitors in general also compete with the home video, pay-per-view and
   cable television markets, the Company believes that such markets have
   assisted the growth of the movie theatre industry in general by
   encouraging a significant increase in the number of first-run movies
   produced and released for initial movie theatre exhibition.

          The Company believes that the principal factors of competition in
   each of its businesses, in varying degrees, are the price and quality of
   its product, quality and location of its facilities, and customer service.
   The Company believes that it is well positioned to compete on the basis of
   these factors.

   Seasonality 

          Historically, the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarters have
   produced the strongest operating results, since such period (i.e., late
   spring through the July 4th holiday season) coincides with the typical
   summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength
   of the travel and food service aspects of the Company's business. 
   However, the Company has been experiencing less seasonality in its theatre
   segment over the past several fiscal years due to the continued increased
   movie industry emphasis on producing films directed to more diverse and
   mature audiences.

   Research and Development 

          Research and development expenditures for the Company are not
   material.

   Environmental Regulation 

          The Company does not expect federal, state or local environmental
   legislation to have a material effect on the Company's capital
   expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  However, the Company's
   activities in acquiring and selling real estate for business development
   purposes have been complicated by the continued increased emphasis placed
   by Company personnel on properly analyzing real estate sites for potential
   environmental problems. This circumstance has resulted in, and is expected
   to continue to result in, greater time and increased costs involved in
   acquiring and selling properties associated with the Company's various
   businesses. 

   Employees 

          As of the end of fiscal 1994, the Company had approximately 7,500
   employees, a majority of whom were employed on a part-time basis.  A
   majority of the Company's hotel employees in Milwaukee and Minneapolis are
   covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Relations with employees
   have been satisfactory and there have been no work stoppages due to labor
   disputes. 

   Item 2. Properties. 

          The Company owns a substantial portion of its facilities, including
   The Pfister Hotel, the Marc Plaza Hotel and the Grand Geneva Resort and
   Spa, and leases the remainder.  The Company also manages or operates three
   hotel properties.  Additionally, the Company owns properties acquired for
   the future construction and operation of new Company operating facilities. 
   Some of its properties are leased from entities owned by principal
   shareholders of the Company.  All of the Company's properties are suitably
   maintained and adequately utilized to cover the respective business
   segment served.

          The operating properties owned or leased by the Company as of
   May 26, 1994 are summarized in the following table:

   Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
             Results of Operation. 

   Results of Operations - General

             The Marcus Corporation and its divisions report their
   consolidated results of operations on either a 52-or 53-week fiscal year. 
   Both fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993 were 52-week years for the Company and
   all of its divisions.  Fiscal 1992 was a 53-week year for the motel,
   hotels and resort and restaurant divisions.  Fiscal 1995 will be a 52-week
   fiscal year for the Company and all of its divisions.

             Total consolidated revenues for fiscal 1994 were $246.3 million,
   an increase of $32.3 million, or 15.1%, compared to fiscal 1993
   consolidated revenues of $214.0 million.  Net earnings for fiscal 1994
   were $22.8 million, or $1.74 per share.  Net earnings increased $6.3
   million, or 38.5%, over fiscal 1993 net earnings of $16.5 million, or
   $1.42 per share.  Earnings per share in fiscal 1994 increased by a smaller
   percentage, 22.5%, than net earnings due to the effect on weighted average
   shares outstanding resulting from the 1,755,000 shares of Common Stock
   issued by the Company in its March 1993 public offering.  Weighted average
   shares outstanding for fiscal 1994 were 13.1 million compared to 11.6
   million for fiscal 1993.  Fiscal 1994 earnings included a one-time $1.8
   million tax benefit, or $0.14 per share, resulting from the Company's
   adoption of SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Excluding the tax
   benefit, fiscal 1994 earnings were $21.0 million, or $1.60 per share.

             The Company's income tax expense for fiscal 1994 was $13.6
   million, an increase of $3.0 million from fiscal 1993.  The Company's
   effective tax rate for fiscal 1994 was 39.3% versus the prior year's
   39.1%.

             Inflation has not had a material impact on the Company's
   consolidated results of operation. 
     
             As a result of the substantial expansion of the Company's hotel
   and resort operations in fiscal 1994 and the increasingly different
   operating characteristics of the Company's hotels and resort from the
   Company's motels, the Company has commenced separate business segment
   reporting for its hotel and resort division and its motel division.  All
   segment information has been retroactively restated to take into account
   the Company's change in segment reporting.

   Motels

   Fiscal 1994 Versus Fiscal 1993 

             Total revenues in fiscal 1994 for the motel division were $89.0
   million, an increase of $8.4 million, or 10.4%, compared to fiscal 1993. 
   The motel division's operating profits in fiscal 1994 totaled $26.0
   million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 9.2%, over the division's fiscal
   1993 operating profits of $23.8 million.

             Occupancy and average daily room rates continued to increase at
   the Company's motels in fiscal 1994 principally as a result of improved
   economic conditions and an effective Budgetel advertising campaign. The
   Company's motel occupancy percentage  increased by 1.4 percentage points
   in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993 and the average daily motel room rate
   increased by 4.0% in fiscal 1994 from 1993. The increased average
   occupancy percentage and daily room rate contributed almost $3.8 million
   to the motel division's increased fiscal 1994 revenues.

             At the close of fiscal 1994, there were 98 Budgetel Inns and one
   Woodfield Suites in operation, compared to 92 Budgetel Inns and one
   Woodfield Suites at 1993 fiscal year-end.  Five new Company-owned Budgetel
   locations and one new franchised Budgetel location opened in fiscal 1994.
   Together, the six new facilities contributed additional revenues of $4.6
   million and nominal operating profits in fiscal 1994.

             The Company currently anticipates that up to seven additional
   Company-owned Budgetel Inns and two new Woodfield Suites will be opened
   during fiscal 1995, together with up to six new franchised Budgetel Inns. 


   Fiscal 1993 Versus Fiscal 1992

             Total revenues for the motel division in fiscal 1993 were $80.6
   million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 8.1%, compared to fiscal 1992. 
   Operating profits for the motel division in fiscal 1993 totaled $23.8
   million, an increase of $3.9 million, or 19.6%, over the division's fiscal
   1992 operating profits of $19.9 million.  The extra operating week in
   fiscal 1992 had an immaterial impact on the foregoing comparisons.

   Theatres 

   Fiscal 1994 Versus Fiscal 1993

             The theatre division's fiscal 1994 revenues were $51.4 million,
   an increase of $7.5 million, or 17.1%, over fiscal 1993.  Operating
   profits for fiscal 1994 were $12.4 million, an increase of $2.7 million,
   or 28.1%, over fiscal 1993.  At fiscal 1994 year-end, the Company operated
   189 screens at 36 locations in Wisconsin and Illinois, compared to 184
   screens at 38 locations at the end of fiscal 1993.  Consistent with the
   Company's long-term strategic plan to focus on operating large multi-
   screen theatres, the Company opened its first Illinois location in fiscal
   1994 at Gurnee Mills in metropolitan Chicago, sold a previously closed
   outdoor theatre, sold two indoor theatres having a total of three screens
   and closed one twin screen theatre.  These theatre sales and closure
   resulted in a reduction of approximately $445,000 of revenues from fiscal
   1993.  The Company intends to add 19 screens during fiscal 1995, including
   a new eight-plex theatre in suburban Milwaukee and 11 screens to existing
   theatres.  

             Revenues of the theatre business are heavily dependent on the
   audience appeal of available films, a factor over which the Company has no
   control.  In fiscal 1994, over 160 first-run films were released, 
   including such box office hits as Jurassic Park, Mrs. Doubtfire, The
   Fugitive, Sleepless in Seattle, The Firm and Schindler's List.  Each of
   these films produced box office receipts in excess of $1.0 million for the
   theatre division.

             Total box office receipts in fiscal 1994 were $35.5 million, an
   increase of almost $5.0 million, or 16.2% from fiscal 1993.  This increase
   can be attributed to a 7.4% increase in attendance and an 8.1% increase in
   the average ticket price.  The increase in attendance was due principally
   to the abundance of high-quality popular films released in fiscal 1994 and
   the opening of the Gurnee Mills ten-plex theatre.

             Vending revenues in fiscal 1994 were $13.6 million, an increase
   of $1.7 million, or 14.6%, over fiscal 1993, due to the increase in
   theatre attendance and the 6.4% increase in the average concession sales
   per person in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993.

   Fiscal 1993 Versus Fiscal 1992

             The theatre division's total fiscal 1993 revenues were $43.9
   million, an increase of $921,000, or 2.1%, over fiscal 1992.  Operating
   profits for fiscal 1993 were $9.7 million, an increase of $530,000, or
   5.8%, over fiscal 1992.

             The Company opened six new screens in fiscal 1993.  During
   fiscal 1993, the Company closed three theatres with a total of seven
   screens.  

   Hotels and Resort

   Fiscal 1994 Versus Fiscal 1993

             Total revenues from the Company's hotel and resort division in
   fiscal 1994 increased by $3.9 million, or 13.7%, to $32.4 million, over
   the previous fiscal year, while operating profits increased by $500,000,
   or 23.4%, to $2.6 million, over fiscal 1993.  Fiscal 1994 occupancy rates
   at the Company's three continuing hotels increased by 5.8% and average
   room rates for the hotel division increased by 1.4% in fiscal 1994.  The
   increase in occupancy and room rates contributed $1.2 million to the
   division's revenues in fiscal 1994.  The remainder of the division's
   increase in revenues in fiscal 1994 was attributable principally to the
   opening of the Grand Geneva Resort & Spa and, to a significantly lesser
   extent, management fees derived from the partial year of operating the
   Company's two newly managed hotels during fiscal 1994.

             As indicated above, during fiscal 1994, the hotel and resort
   division added three new properties totaling 735 rooms through the
   Company's July 1993 purchase of The Grand Geneva Resort & Spa and by
   entering into two hotel management contracts, one for the 226-room Crowne
   Plaza-Northstar in November 1993, and the other for the 154-room Mead Inn
   in February 1994.  The Company intends to continue pursuing additional
   hotel and resort acquisitions and management contracts.

   Fiscal 1993 Versus Fiscal 1992

             Total revenues for the hotel and resort division in fiscal 1993
   were $28.5 million, an increase of $400,000, or 1.4%, compared to fiscal
   1992.  Operating profits for the hotel and resort division in fiscal 1993
   totaled $2.1 million, an increase of $286,000, or 15.6%, over the
   division's fiscal 1992 operating profits of $1.8 million.  The hotel and
   resort division reported results for a 53-week year in fiscal 1992, with
   the additional week generating approximately $300,000 in added revenues
   and $100,000 in operating profits.  Excluding the additional week in
   fiscal 1992, the division's revenue increase in fiscal 1993 was negligible
   over fiscal 1992, and the comparative operating profits increase was
   $386,000 or 22.3%.

   Restaurants

   Fiscal 1994 Versus Fiscal 1993

             The restaurant division operates facilities under a number of
   different restaurant concepts and the Company is continually trying to
   position its restaurants in order to best respond to changing consumer
   tastes and preferences.  These efforts include closing or selling less
   profitable locations,  converting them into different concepts or
   remodeling them.  The Company also actively considers developing or being
   the franchisee for new restaurant concepts.  At the close of fiscal 1994,
   the Company operated 13 Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bars, 35 KFCs, 13
   Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mills, four Marc's Big Boys, two Big Boy Expresses
   and one Original Gino's East of Chicago.  

             Restaurant division revenues totaled $71.1 million for fiscal
   1994, an increase of $12.0 million, or 20.2%, from fiscal 1993.  The
   revenue increase was due almost entirely to the Company's newly opened
   Applebee's and increasing customer counts and average check amounts at the
   Company's continuing Applebee's and KFC restaurants.  The division's
   operating profits for fiscal 1994 were $2.2 million, an increase of $1.5
   million, or 204.7%, from fiscal 1993.  Fiscal 1994 operating profit
   improvements were derived principally from improved same store sales at
   continuing Applebee's and cost savings realized from closing or selling a
   number of underperforming Big Boy restaurants during the last two fiscal
   years.  

             In fiscal 1994, the Company's continuing Applebee's restaurants
   achieved an 8.8% increase in same store sales and a 3.9% increase in guest
   counts. These factors contributed a $715,000 increase in the division's
   fiscal 1994 revenues.

             Additionally, the Company opened two new Applebee's restaurants
   during fiscal 1994 in its metropolitan Chicago franchise market, together
   with one new restaurant and one expanded location in its Wisconsin
   franchise area.  These new and expanded locations contributed $4.3 million
   in additional revenues in fiscal 1994, although start-up costs associated 
   with the new restaurants resulted in a $278,000 reduction in the
   division's operating profits.  In fiscal 1995, the Company plans to open
   six to eight new  Applebee's restaurants.  

             KFC experienced an increase in guest counts, coupled with an
   increase in average check amounts, which resulted in a same store sales
   increase of 5.2%, or approximately $ 1.2 million, over fiscal 1993. 
   During fiscal 1994, the Company's KFC restaurants introduced two new
   franchisor-sponsored products, The Colonel's Rotisserie Gold Chicken in
   the fall of 1993, and a new eight-piece fried chicken cut with larger
   breast pieces in May 1994.  These new products contributed approximately
   $2 million in revenues in fiscal 1994.  Additionally, the Company realized
   $288,000 in additional revenue during the year from the relocation of two
   KFC restaurants in Milwaukee.  The Company plans to open two or three new
   KFCs late in fiscal 1995. 

             The Company continued to reduce its number of underperforming
   Marc's Big Boy restaurants by closing one Big Boy during fiscal 1994 and
   plans to ultimately close its remaining four Big Boy locations.  The Big
   Boy closing, combined with the other Big Boy closings in fiscal 1993,
   resulted in a loss of $2.1 million of fiscal 1993 revenues, but had a
   positive impact of $340,000 on the division's fiscal 1994 operating
   profits. 

             The Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mill concept entered its second year
   in fiscal 1994, continuing its developmental process as customer counts
   and same store sales varied by location.  On an aggregate basis, revenues
   and operating profits in fiscal 1994 from Marc's Cafes were flat compared
   to fiscal 1993.  This family-oriented restaurant segment is highly
   competitive and the Company continues to examine alternatives and
   refinements to this restaurant concept in order to improve further the
   division's over-all results.  

             The Company continues to monitor closely the operating
   performance and consumer acceptance of its two Big Boy Express restaurant
   locations and its newly opened Gino's East of Chicago restaurant.  These
   locations contributed nominally to the division's revenues in fiscal 1994
   and experienced operating losses because of anticipated start-up expenses.

   Fiscal 1993 Versus Fiscal 1992

             Restaurant division revenues totaled $59.1 million for fiscal
   1993, an increase of $3.0 million, or 5.4%, from fiscal 1992.  The
   division's fiscal 1993 results were based on 52 weeks, versus 53 weeks in
   fiscal 1992.  Excluding the additional week in fiscal 1992, revenues in
   fiscal 1993 increased approximately 6.3% from the prior year.  The
   division's operating profits for fiscal 1993 were $723,000, an increase of
   $289,000, or 66.6%, from fiscal 1992 operating profits of $434,000.  The
   operating profits from the additional week in fiscal 1992 were
   approximately $150,000.

   Financial Condition

             At the end of fiscal 1994, the Company's current ratio was .67,
   compared to .90 at the end of fiscal 1993.  Given the cash nature of the
   Company's various businesses and the availability to the Company of $15
   million in unused credit lines at fiscal 1994 year-end, the Company
   believes that the cash generated from its ongoing operations and available
   credit facilities are adequate to support the ongoing operational
   liquidity needs of the Company's businesses.

             Net cash provided from operations increased $13.3 million in
   fiscal 1994 to $50.1 million compared to fiscal 1993.  The increase
   resulted from increased net earnings, an increase in depreciation and
   amortization expense reflecting the Company's continuing facilities
   expansion and an increase in net liabilities resulting from differences in
   the timing of payments on accounts payable.

             Investing activity increased $29.2 million to $74.8 million in
   fiscal 1994 primarily resulting from capital expenditures to support the
   Company's expansion.  The most significant amount of capital spent by the
   Company during fiscal 1994 was on the renovation of the Grand Geneva
   Resort & Spa.  The Grand Geneva renovation is expected to be completed by
   the fall of 1994.  Other significant capital expenditures in fiscal 1994
   were made in opening new motels, theatres and restaurants.

             Principally as a result of funding a portion of the  Company's
   fiscal 1994 facility expansions and renovations, the Company's total debt
   increased to $112.0 million at the close of fiscal 1994 compared to $89.0
   million at the end of fiscal 1993.  In addition to the incurrence of $23.7
   million of new debt to finance expansion, approximately $41.0 million in
   debt was raised to refinance at reduced interest rates existing debt. The
   Company's debt- capitalization ratio at May 26, 1994 was .37 compared to
   .34 at May 27, 1993.

             The Company is currently undertaking an aggressive five-year
   expansion plan which will impact all four of its business segments.  The
   current aggregate estimated cost of these expansion plans is between $350
   million and $400 million, with total estimated capital expenditures in
   fiscal 1995 (including normal continuing capital maintenance projects)
   expected to be almost $90 million.  The Company's fiscal 1995 expansion
   plans are expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and up
   to $55 million in additional long-term debt.  

   Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 


                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



   The Board of Directors and Shareholders

   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
   based on our audits. 

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The
   Marcus Corporation at May 26, 1994 and May 27, 1993, and the consolidated
   results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
   in the period ended May 26, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted
   accounting principles.

   As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
   May 28, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income
   taxes.

   1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Principles of Consolidation -  The consolidated financial statements
   include the accounts of The Marcus Corporation and all of its subsidiaries
   (the Company). Investments in 50%-owned affiliates for which the Company
   has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for on the
   equity method. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
   eliminated in consolidation.

   Fiscal Year -  The Company reports on a 52/53-week year ending the last
   Thursday of May.

   Cash Equivalents -  The Company considers all highly liquid investments
   with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
   equivalents.

   Inventories -  Inventories, consisting principally of food and beverages,
   are stated at average cost or at first-in, first-out cost.

   Preopening Costs -  Costs pertaining to new or remodeled motels and certain
   restaurant concepts are charged to operations over 12 months. Similar
   expenses incurred in connection with the opening and remodeling of
   theatres and all other restaurants are charged to operations at the time
   of opening. Costs incurred in connection with the opening of the Grand
   Geneva Resort have been capitalized and will be charged to operations over
   three years.

   Depreciation and Amortization -  Depreciation and amortization of property
   and equipment, including capital leases, is provided using the
   straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

                                          Years

   Land improvements                    10    33

   Leasehold improvements                3    33
   Furniture, fixtures and equipment     3    15

   Net Earnings Per Share -  Net earnings per share were computed based on the
   weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, Class B Common Stock
   and common stock equivalents (stock options) outstanding during the year.

   Capitalization of Interest -  The Company capitalizes interest on borrowed
   funds during construction periods by adding such interest to the cost of
   property and equipment. Interest of approximately $726,000, $314,000 and
   $177,000 was capitalized in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

   amount aggregating $30,000,000. Two of the swap agreements covering
   $15,000,000 expire June 30, 1995, and require the Company to pay interest
   at defined variable rates (3.50% and 5.25%) and receive interest at
   defined fixed rates (4.13% and 4.57%). The remaining swap agreement
   covering $15,000,000 expires October 31, 2000, and requires the Company to
   pay interest at a defined fixed rate of 5.08% while receiving interest at
   a defined variable rate of LIBOR. The Company recorded expense related to
   these swap agreements in 1994 totaling $94,000. The accompanying
   consolidated balance sheet at May 26, 1994, does not reflect the fair
   market value of these swap agreements which totals approximately $680,000.

   4. Shareholders' Equity

   The Company's Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split,
   effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend, distributed on November 6,
   1992, to all holders of Common and Class B Common Stock. All per share,
   weighted average shares outstanding and stock option data prior to
   November 6, 1992, have been adjusted to reflect this dividend. 

   Shareholders may convert their shares of Class B Common Stock into shares
   of Common Stock at any time. Class B Common Stock shareholders are
   substantially restricted in their ability to transfer their Class B Common
   Stock. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends per share
   equal to 110% of all dividends declared and paid on each share of the
   Class B Common Stock. Holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten
   votes per share while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per
   share on any matters brought before the shareholders of the Company.
   Liquidation rights are the same for both classes of stock.

   Shareholders have approved the issuance of up to 562,500 shares of Common
   Stock under stock option plans. The options generally become exercisable
   40% after two years, 60% after three years and 80% after four years. The
   remaining options are exercisable four and one-half years after the date
   of the grant. At May 26, 1994, there were 147,255 shares available for
   grants under the plans. 

   Transactions with respect to the Company's stock option plans for each of
   the three years in the period ended May 26, 1994, are summarized as

   5. Employee Benefit Plans

   The Company has a qualified profit-sharing savings plan (401(k) plan)
   covering eligible employees. The 401(k) plan provides for a contribution
   of a minimum of 1% of defined compensation for all plan participants and
   matching of 25% of employee contributions up to 6% of defined
   compensation. In addition, the Company may make additional discretionary
   contributions. The Company also operates unfunded nonqualified defined

   Effective May 28, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes 
   (SFAS No. 109). SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets
   and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
   have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
   method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
   difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
   liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences
   are expected to reverse.

   As of May 28, 1993, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $1,782,000, or
   $.14 per share, which amount represents the net change in its deferred
   income tax assets and liabilities at that date. Such amount has been
   reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings as the cumulative
   effect of change in accounting for income taxes. 

   The components of the net deferred tax liability as of May 26, 1994, were
   as follows (in thousands):

   Deferred tax assets:
   Tax credit carryforwards             $     921
   Accrued employee benefits                  604
   Other accrued liabilities                  203

                                          =======

   Deferred income taxes in 1993 and 1992 also related principally to
   differences between financial and tax reporting of depreciation and
   amortization.

   A reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the effective tax
   rate follows:

   9. Business Segment Information

   The Company operates principally in four business segments: Restaurants,
   Theatres, Hotels/Resorts and Motels. Prior to 1994, the Company reported
   in three business segments. However, due to the expansion of the hotel
   operations and the increasingly different operating characteristics of the
   hotel division from the motel division, the Company has commenced separate
   business segment reporting in 1994 for the hotel and motel divisions,
   resulting in four segments. All prior year segment information has been
   restated to reflect this change. Following is a summary of business
   segment information for 1992 through 1994:

    (A) Average amount outstanding during the period is computed by dividing the total of the daily outstanding principal
        balance by 365.

        average short-term debt outstanding during the period prorated for the period outstanding.

    (C) The Company has the ability to replace commercial paper borrowings and the revolving credit agreements with borrowings
        under a long-term revolving credit agreement.  Accordingly, the Company has classified the outstanding commercial paper

        balance by 96 (beginning of the fiscal year through final payment on the revolving credit agreement on September 3,

                            ARTICLE II.  SHAREHOLDERS

             2.01.   Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of the shareholders
   shall be held on such day in September or October of each year as may be
   designated by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, for the
   purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other
   business as may come before the meeting.  If the day fixed for the annual
   meeting shall be a legal holiday in the State of Wisconsin, such meeting
   shall be held on the next succeeding business day.  

             2.02.   Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders,
   for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law, may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the
   President or the Board of Directors.  The corporation shall call a special
   meeting of shareholders in the event that the holders of at least 10% of
   all of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be
   considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date and deliver to the
   corporation one or more written demands for the meeting describing one or
   more purposes for which it is to be held. The corporation shall give
   notice of such a special meeting within thirty days after the date that
   the demand is delivered to the corporation.

             2.03.   Place of Meeting.  The Board of Directors may designate
   any place, either within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place
   of meeting for any annual or special meeting of shareholders.  If no
   designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of
   the corporation.  Any meeting may be adjourned to reconvene at any place
   designated by vote of the shares represented thereat.

             2.04.   Notice of Meeting.  Written notice stating the date,
   time and place of any meeting of shareholders and, in case of a special
   meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be
   delivered not less than ten days nor more than sixty days before the date
   of the meeting (unless a different time is provided by the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law or the articles of incorporation), either
   personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the President or the
   Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting
   and to such other persons as required by the Wisconsin Business
   Corporation Law.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be effective
   when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at
   his or her address as it appears on the stock record books of the
   corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. If an annual or special meeting
   of shareholders is adjourned to a different date, time or place, the
   corporation shall not be required to give notice of the new date, time or
   place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before
   adjournment; provided, however, that if a new record date for an adjourned
   meeting is or must be fixed, the corporation shall give notice of the
   adjourned meeting to persons who are shareholders as of the new record
   date.

             2.045.  Proper Business or Purposes of Shareholder Meetings.  To
   be properly brought before a meeting of shareholders for voting
   consideration, business must be (a) specified in the notice of the meeting
   (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the discretion of the Board of
   Directors or otherwise as provided in Section 2.04 hereof; (b) otherwise
   properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
   Directors; or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a
   shareholder.  For business to be properly brought before a meeting by a
   shareholder, the shareholder must have given written notification thereof,
   either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to
   the Secretary of the corporation at its principal business office, and, in
   the case of an annual meeting of shareholders, such notification must be
   given not later than fifteen (15) days in advance of the Originally
   Scheduled Date of such meeting.  Any such notification shall set forth as
   to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting for
   voting consideration (i) a brief description of the business desired to be
   brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at
   the meeting and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to
   amend either the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation,
   the exact language of the proposed amendment; (ii) whether or not such
   business is in the nature of a precatory proposal; (iii) the name and
   address of the shareholder proposing such business; (iv) a representation
   that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation
   entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by
   proxy at the meeting to propose such business; and (v) any material
   interest of the shareholder in such business.  No business shall be
   conducted at a meeting of shareholders except in accordance with this
   Section 2.045, and the chairperson of any meeting of shareholders may
   refuse to permit any business to be brought before such meeting without
   compliance with the foregoing procedures.  For purposes of these bylaws,
   the "Originally Scheduled Date" of any meeting of shareholders shall be
   the date such meeting is scheduled to occur as specified in the notice of
   such meeting first generally given to shareholders regardless of whether
   any subsequent notice is given for such meeting or the record date of such
   meeting is changed. Nothing contained in this Section 2.045 shall be
   construed to limit the rights of a shareholder to submit proposals to the
   corporation which comply with Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange
   Act of 1934, as amended ("Registration 14A"), for inclusion in the
   corporation's proxy statement for voting consideration at shareholder
   meetings.

             2.05.   Waiver of Notice.  A shareholder may waive any notice
   required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the articles of
   incorporation or these bylaws before or after the date and time stated in
   the notice.  The waiver shall be in writing and signed by the shareholder
   entitled to the notice, contain the same information that would have been
   required in the notice under applicable provisions of the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law (except that the time and place of meeting need
   not be stated) and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the
   corporate records.  A shareholder's attendance at a meeting, in person or
   by proxy, waives objection to all of the following:  (a) lack of notice or
   defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning
   of the meeting or promptly upon arrival objects to holding the meeting or
   transacting business at the meeting; and (b) consideration of a particular
   matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose described in the
   meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter
   when it is presented.

             2.06.   Fixing of Record Date.  The Board of Directors may fix
   in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining
   shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of
   shareholders, shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting as
   contemplated by Section 2.02 hereof, shareholders entitled to take any
   other action, or shareholders for any other purpose.  Such record date
   shall not be more than seventy days prior to the date on which the
   particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be
   taken.  If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for the determination of shareholders
   entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders, the record
   date shall be the close of business on the day before the first notice is
   given to shareholders.  If no record date is fixed by the Board of
   Directors or by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for the
   determination of shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting as
   contemplated in Section 2.02 hereof, the record date shall be the date
   that the first shareholder signs the demand.  Except as provided by the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for a court-ordered adjournment, a
   determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a
   meeting of shareholders is effective for any adjournment of such meeting
   unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it shall do
   if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date
   fixed for the original meeting.  The record date for determining
   shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than a distribution
   involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation's
   shares) or a share dividend is the date on which the Board of Directors
   authorized the distribution or share dividend, as the case may be, unless
   the Board of Directors fixes a different record date.

             2.07.   Shareholders' List for Meetings.  After a record date
   for a special or annual meeting of shareholders has been fixed, the
   corporation shall prepare a list of the names of all of the shareholders
   entitled to notice of the meeting.  The list shall be arranged by class or
   series of shares, if any, and show the address of and number of shares
   held by each shareholder.  Such list shall be available for inspection by
   any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting
   is given for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the
   meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in
   the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held.  A
   shareholder or his or her agent may, on written demand, inspect and,
   subject to the limitations imposed by the Wisconsin Business Corporation
   Law, copy the list, during regular business hours and at his or her
   expense, during the period that it is available for inspection pursuant to
   this Section 2.07.  The corporation shall make the shareholders' list
   available at the meeting and any shareholder or his or her agent or
   attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any
   adjournment thereof.  Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the
   shareholders' list shall not affect the validity of any action taken at a
   meeting of shareholders.

             2.08.   Quorum and Voting Requirements.  Shares entitled to vote
   as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only
   if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter.  If the
   corporation has only one class of stock outstanding, such class shall
   constitute a separate voting group for purposes of this Section 2.08. 
   Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, any bylaw
   adopted under authority granted in the articles of incorporation, or the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the votes entitled to be
   cast on the matter shall constitute a quorum of the voting group for
   action on that matter.  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a
   meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to holding the meeting or
   transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes
   of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting
   and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or
   must be set for the adjourned meeting.  If a quorum exists, except in the
   case of the election of directors, action on a matter shall be approved if
   the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the
   votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of incorporation, any
   bylaw adopted under authority granted in the articles of incorporation, or
   the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of
   affirmative votes.  Unless otherwise provided in the articles of
   incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast
   by the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors at a meeting
   at which a quorum is present.  For purposes of this Section 2.08,
   "plurality" means that the individuals with the largest number of votes
   are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be
   chosen at the meeting.  Though less than a quorum of the outstanding votes
   of a voting group are represented at a meeting, a majority of the votes so
   represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
   notice.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or
   represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
   transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

             2.09.   Conduct of Meeting.  The Chief Executive Officer, and in
   his or her absence, the Chairman of the Board or the President, as the
   case may be, and in their absence, a Vice President in the order provided
   under Section 4.09 hereof, and in their absence, any person chosen by the
   shareholders represented at the meeting in person or by proxy shall call
   the meeting of the shareholders to order and shall act as chairperson of
   the meeting, and the Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary
   of all meetings of the shareholders, but, in the absence of the Secretary,
   the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of
   the meeting.

             2.10.   Proxies.  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder
   may vote his or her shares in person or by proxy.  A shareholder may
   appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an
   appointment form, either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact.  An
   appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or
   other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. 
   An appointment is valid for eleven months from the date of its signing
   unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form.

             2.11.   Voting of Shares.  Except as provided in the articles of
   incorporation or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, each
   outstanding share of Common Stock is entitled to one (1) vote, and each
   outstanding share of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to ten (10)
   votes, upon each matter voted on at a meeting of shareholders.

             2.12.   Action without Meeting.  Any action required or
   permitted by the articles of incorporation or these bylaws or any
   provision of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be taken at a
   meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without
   action by the Board of Directors if a written consent or consents,
   describing the action so taken, is signed by all of the shareholders
   entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof and delivered
   to the corporation for inclusion in the corporate records.

             2.13.   Acceptance of Instruments Showing Shareholder Action. 
   If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment
   corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in
   good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and
   give it effect as the act of a shareholder.  If the name signed on a vote,
   consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a
   shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, may accept the
   vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act
   of the shareholder if any of the following apply:

             (a)  The shareholder is an entity and the name signed
        purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.

             (b)  The name purports to be that of a personal
        representative, administrator, executor, guardian or conservator
        representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests,
        evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation is
        presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy
        appointment.

             (c)  The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or
        trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation
        requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation
        is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy
        appointment.

             (d)  The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee,
        beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if
        the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation
        of the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder is
        presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy
        appointment.

             (e)  Two or more persons are the shareholders as co-tenants
        or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at
        least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be
        acting on behalf of all co-owners.

   The corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if
   the Secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation who is
   authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis
   for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the
   signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.

                        ARTICLE III.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS

             3.01.   General Powers and Number.  All corporate powers shall
   be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of
   the corporation managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors. 
   The number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the
   corporation shall initially be seven (7) and thereafter such number as is
   fixed from time to time by a majority vote of the Board of Directors then
   in office.

             3.02.   Tenure and Qualifications.  Each director shall hold
   office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her
   successor shall have been elected and, if necessary, qualified, or until
   there is a decrease in the number of directors which takes effect after
   the expiration of his or her term, or until his or her prior death,
   resignation or removal.  A director may be removed by the shareholders
   only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the director, and the
   meeting notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of
   the meeting is removal of the director.  A director may be removed from
   office with or without cause if the number of votes cast to remove the
   director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove such director.  A
   director may resign at any time by delivering written notice which
   complies with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to the Board of
   Directors, to the President (in his or her capacity as chairperson of the
   Board of Directors) or to the corporation.  A director's resignation is
   effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later
   effective date.  Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin
   or shareholders of the corporation.

             3.025.  Shareholder Nomination Procedure.  Nominations for the
   election of directors may be made by (a) the Board of Directors; (b) a
   committee appointed by the Board of Directors; or (c) any shareholder
   entitled to vote for the election of directors at such meeting who
   complies fully with the requirements of this Section 3.025.  Any
   shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at a meeting
   may nominate a person or persons for election as a director or directors
   only if written notice of such shareholder's intent to make any such
   nomination is given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail,
   postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the corporation at its principal
   business office not later than fifteen (15) days in advance of the
   Originally Scheduled Date of such meeting.  Each such notice shall set
   forth: (a) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the
   nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a
   representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the
   corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in
   person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons
   specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or
   understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other
   person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
   nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such
   background and other information regarding each nominee proposed by such
   shareholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy
   statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A had each nominee been
   nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e)
   the written consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the
   corporation if so elected. The chairperson of any meeting of shareholders
   to elect directors and the Board of Directors may refuse to acknowledge
   the nomination by a shareholder of any person not made in compliance with
   the foregoing procedure.

             3.03.   Regular Meetings.  A regular meeting of the Board of
   Directors shall be held without other notice than this bylaw immediately
   after the annual meeting of shareholders and each adjourned session
   thereof.  The place of such regular meeting shall be the same as the place
   of the meeting of shareholders which precedes it, or such other suitable
   place as may be announced at such meeting of shareholders.  The Board of
   Directors may provide, by resolution, the date, time and place, either
   within or without the State of Wisconsin, for the holding of additional
   regular meetings of the Board of Directors without other notice than such
   resolution.

             3.04.   Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of
   Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chief Executive
   Officer, the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary or any
   two directors.  The President or Secretary may fix any place, either
   within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place for holding any
   special meeting of the Board of Directors, and if no other place is fixed
   the place of the meeting shall be the principal office of the corporation
   in the State of Wisconsin.

             3.05.   Notice; Waiver.  Notice of each meeting of the Board of
   Directors (unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to Section 3.03) shall
   be given by written notice delivered in person, by telegraph, teletype,
   facsimile or other form of wire or wireless communication, or by mail or
   private carrier, to each director at his business address or at such other
   address as such director shall have designated in writing filed with the
   Secretary, in each case not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
   meeting.  The notice need not describe the purpose of the meeting of the
   Board of Directors or the business to be transacted at such meeting.  If
   mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when deposited in the
   United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.  If notice
   is given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when the
   telegram is delivered to the telegraph company.  If notice is given by
   private carrier, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when
   delivered to the private carrier.  Whenever any notice whatever is
   required to be given to any director of the corporation under the articles
   of incorporation or these bylaws or any provision of the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time,
   whether before or after the date and time of meeting, by the director
   entitled to such notice shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such
   notice. The corporation shall retain any such waiver as part of the
   permanent corporate records.  A director's attendance at or participation
   in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting
   unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his
   or her arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at
   the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at
   the meeting.

             3.06.   Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law or by the articles of incorporation or these
   bylaws, a majority of the number of directors specified in Section 3.01 of
   these bylaws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at
   any meeting of the Board of Directors.  Except as otherwise provided by
   the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or by the articles of incorporation
   or by these bylaws, a quorum of any committee of the Board of Directors
   created pursuant to Section 3.12 hereof shall consist of a majority of the
   number of directors appointed to serve on the committee.  A majority of
   the directors present (though less than such quorum) may adjourn any
   meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case
   may be, from time to time without further notice.

             3.07.   Manner of Acting.  The affirmative vote of a majority of
   the directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a
   committee thereof at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
   Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, unless the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the articles of incorporation or these
   bylaws require the vote of a greater number of directors.

             3.08.   Conduct of Meetings.  The Chief Executive Officer, and
   in his or her absence, the Chairman of the Board or the President, as the
   case may be, and in their absence, a Vice President, in the order provided
   under Section 4.09, and in their absence, any director chosen by the
   directors present, shall call meetings of the Board of Directors to order
   and shall act as chairperson of the meeting.  The Secretary of the
   corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the Board of
   Directors but in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may
   appoint any other person present to act as secretary of the meeting. 
   Minutes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors shall
   be prepared and distributed to each director.

             3.09.   Vacancies.  Except as provided below, any vacancy
   occurring in the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an
   increase in the number of directors, may be filled by any of the
   following:  (a) the shareholders; (b) the Board of Directors; or (c) if
   the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the
   Board of Directors, the directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority
   of all directors remaining in office.  In the case of a vacancy created by
   the removal of a director by vote of the shareholders, the shareholders
   shall have the right to fill such vacancy at the same meeting or any
   adjournment thereof.  If the vacant office was held by a director elected
   by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders of shares of that
   voting group may vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the
   shareholders, and only the remaining directors elected by that voting
   group may vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the directors.  A
   vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, because of a resignation
   effective at a later date or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy
   occurs, but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

             3.10.   Compensation.  The Board of Directors, irrespective of
   any personal interest of any of its members, may establish reasonable
   compensation of all directors for services to the corporation as directors
   or may delegate such authority to an appropriate committee.  The Board of
   Directors also shall have authority to provide for or delegate authority
   to an appropriate committee to provide for reasonable pensions, disability
   or death benefits, and other benefits or payments, to directors, officers
   and employees and to their estates, families, dependents or beneficiaries
   on account of prior services rendered by such directors, officers and
   employees to the corporation.

             3.11.   Presumption of Assent.  A director who is present and is
   announced as present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any
   committee thereof created in accordance with Section 3.12 hereof, when
   corporate action is taken, assents to the action taken unless any of the
   following occurs:  (a) the director objects at the beginning of the
   meeting or promptly upon his or her arrival to holding the meeting or
   transacting business at the meeting; (b) the director dissents or abstains
   from an action taken and minutes of the meeting are prepared that show the
   director's dissent or abstention from the action taken;  (c) the director
   delivers written notice that complies with the Wisconsin Business
   Corporation Law of his or her dissent or abstention to the presiding
   officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the corporation
   immediately after adjournment of the meeting; or (d) the director dissents
   or abstains from an action taken, minutes of the meeting are prepared that
   fail to show the director's dissent or abstention from the action taken,
   and the director delivers to the corporation a written notice of that
   failure that complies with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law promptly
   after receiving the minutes.  Such right of dissent or abstention shall
   not apply to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.

             3.12.   Committees.  The Board of Directors by resolution
   adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors then
   in office may create one or more committees, appoint members of the Board
   of Directors to serve on the committees and designate other members of the
   Board of Directors to serve as alternates.  Each committee shall have two
   or more members who shall, unless otherwise provided by the Board of
   Directors, serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  A committee
   may be authorized to exercise the authority of the Board of Directors,
   except that a committee may not do any of the following:  (a) authorize
   distributions; (b) approve or propose to shareholders action that the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires to be approved by
   shareholders; (c) fill vacancies on the Board of Directors or, unless the
   Board of Directors provides by resolution that vacancies on a committee
   shall be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining committee
   members, on any Board committee; (d) amend the corporation's articles of
   incorporation; (e) adopt, amend or repeal bylaws; (f) approve a plan of
   merger not requiring shareholder approval; (g) authorize or approve
   reacquisition of shares, except according to a formula or method
   prescribed by the Board of Directors; and (h) authorize or approve the

   designation and relative rights, preferences and limitations of a class or
   series of shares, except that the Board of Directors may authorize a
   committee to do so within limits prescribed by the Board of Directors. 
   Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in creating the
   committee, a committee may employ counsel, accountants and other
   consultants to assist it in the exercise of its authority.

             3.13.   Telephonic Meetings.  Except as herein provided and
   notwithstanding any place set forth in the notice of the meeting or these
   bylaws, members of the Board of Directors (and any committees thereof
   created pursuant to Section 3.12 hereof) may participate in regular or
   special meetings by, or through the use of, any means of communication by
   which all participants may simultaneously hear each other, such as by
   conference telephone.  If a meeting is conducted by such means, then at
   the commencement of such meeting the presiding officer shall inform the
   participating directors that a meeting is taking place at which official
   business may be transacted.  Any participant in a meeting by such means
   shall be deemed present in person at such meeting.  Notwithstanding the
   foregoing, no action may be taken at any meeting held by such means on any
   particular matter which the presiding officer determines, in his or her
   sole discretion, to be inappropriate under the circumstances for action at
   a meeting held by such means.  Such determination shall be made and
   announced in advance of such meeting.

             3.14.   Action Without Meeting.  Any action required or
   permitted by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be taken at a
   meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof created pursuant
   to Section 3.12 hereof may be taken without a meeting if the action is
   taken by all members of the Board or of the committee.  The action shall
   be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken,
   signed by each director or committee member and retained by the
   corporation.  Such action shall be effective when the last director or
   committee member signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a
   different effective date.

                              ARTICLE IV.  OFFICERS

             4.01.   Number.  The principal officers of the corporation shall
   be a President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer, each of whom shall be
   elected by the Board of Directors.  A Chairman of the Board, any number of
   Vice Presidents, other officers and assistant officers as may be deemed
   necessary may be elected or appointed by the Board of Directors.  The
   Board of Directors may also authorize any duly appointed officer to
   appoint one or more officers or assistant officers.  The Chief Executive
   Officer, designated in accordance with Section 4.06 of these By-laws, may
   from time to time appoint any number of Vice Presidents as he shall
   determine necessary who shall hold their offices for such terms and shall
   exercise such powers and perform such duties as the Chief Executive
   Officer shall from time to time determine.  Any two or more offices may be
   held by the same person.

             4.02.   Election and Term of Office.  The officers of the
   corporation to be elected by the Board of Directors shall be elected
   annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board of
   Directors held after each annual meeting of the shareholders.  If the
   election of officers shall not be held at such meeting, such election
   shall be held as soon thereafter as is practicable.  Each officer shall
   hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected or
   until his or her prior death, resignation or removal.

             4.03.   Removal.  The Board of Directors may remove any officer
   and, unless restricted by the Board of Directors or these By-laws, an
   officer may remove any officer or assistant officer appointed by that
   officer, at any time, with or without cause and notwithstanding the
   contract rights, if any, of the officer removed.  The appointment of an
   officer does not of itself create contract rights.

             4.04.   Resignation.  An officer may resign at any time by
   delivering notice to the corporation that complies with the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law.  The resignation shall be effective when the
   notice is delivered, unless the notice specifies a later effective date
   and the corporation accepts the later effective date.

             4.05.   Vacancies.  A vacancy in any principal office because of
   death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, shall be
   filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term. 
   If a resignation of an officer is effective at a later date as
   contemplated by Section 4.04 hereof, the Board of Directors may fill the
   pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board provides that the
   successor may not take office until the effective date.

             4.06.   Chief Executive Officer.  The Board of Directors shall
   from time to time designate the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the
   President of the corporation as the Chief Executive Officer of the
   corporation.  The President shall be the Chief Executive Officer whenever
   the office of Chairman of the Board of the corporation is vacant.  Subject
   to the control of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer
   shall in general supervise and control all of the business and affairs of
   the corporation.  He shall preside at all meetings of the shareholders and
   of the Board of Directors.  He shall have authority, subject to such rules
   as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors, to appoint and remove such
   agents and employees of the corporation as he shall deem necessary, to
   prescribe their powers, duties and compensation, and to delegate authority
   to them.  He shall have authority to sign, execute and acknowledge, on
   behalf of the corporation, all deeds, mortgages, securities, contracts,
   leases, reports, and all other documents or other instruments necessary or
   proper to be executed in the course of the corporation's regular business,
   or which shall be authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors; and,
   except as otherwise provided by law or the Board of Directors, he may
   authorize any elected Vice President or other officer or agent of the
   corporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such documents or instruments
   in his place and stead.  In general, he shall perform all duties incident
   to the office of Chief Executive Officer of the corporation and such other
   duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

             4.07.   Chairman of the Board.  The Chairman of the Board, if
   one be chosen by the Board of Directors, when present, and in the absence
   of the Chief Executive Officer if the President is designated as the Chief
   Executive Officer, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors
   and of the shareholders and shall perform all duties incident to the
   office of Chairman of the Board of the corporation and such other duties
   as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

             4.08.   President.  The President shall be the principal
   executive officer of the corporation and, subject to the direction of the
   Board of Directors, shall in general supervise and control all of the
   business and affairs of the corporation; provided, however, that should
   the Board of Directors elect a Chairman of the Board, any or all of the
   powers customarily incidental to the office of President may be assigned
   by the Board of Directors to the Chairman of the Board.  If the Chairman
   of the Board is designated as the Chief Executive Officer, the President
   shall be the chief operating officer of the corporation.  Unless the Board
   of Directors otherwise provides, in the absence of the Chairman of the
   Board or in the event of his inability or refusal to act, or in the event
   of a vacancy in the office of the Chairman of the Board, the President
   shall perform the duties of the Chairman of the Board, and when so acting
   shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon
   the Chairman of the Board.  The President shall, when present, preside at
   all meetings of the shareholders and of the Board of Directors.  He or she
   shall have authority, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the
   Board of Directors, to appoint such agents and employees of the
   corporation as he or she shall deem necessary, to prescribe their powers,
   duties and compensation, and to delegate authority to them.  Such agents
   and employees shall hold office at the discretion of the President.  He or
   she shall have authority to sign, execute and acknowledge, on behalf of
   the corporation, all deeds, mortgages, bonds, stock certificates,
   contracts, leases, reports and all other documents or instruments
   necessary or proper to be executed in the course of the corporation's
   regular business, or which shall be authorized by resolution of the Board
   of Directors; and, except as otherwise provided by law or the Board of
   Directors, he or she may authorize any Vice President or other officer or
   agent of the corporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such documents
   or instruments in his or her place and stead.  In general he or she shall
   perform all duties incident to the office of President and such other
   duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

             4.09.   The Vice Presidents.  In the absence of the Chairman of
   the Board, if any, and the President or in the event of their death,
   inability or refusal to act, or in the event for any reason it shall be
   impracticable for the Chairman of the Board and the President to act
   personally, the Vice President (or in the event there be more than one
   Vice President, the Vice Presidents in the order designated by the Board
   of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, or in the absence of any
   designation, then in the order of their election) shall perform the duties
   of the Chairman of the Board and/or the President, and when so acting,
   shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon
   the Chairman of the Board and/or the President.  Any Vice President may
   sign, with the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, certificates for shares
   of the corporation; and shall perform such other duties and have such
   authority as from time to time may be delegated or assigned to him or her
   by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Board of Directors.
   The execution of any instrument of the corporation by any Vice President
   shall be conclusive evidence, as to third parties, of his or her authority
   to act in the stead of the Chairman of the Board and/or the President.

             4.10.   The Secretary.  The Secretary shall:  (a) keep minutes
   of the meetings of the shareholders and of the Board of Directors (and of
   committees thereof) in one or more books provided for that purpose
   (including records of actions taken by the shareholders or the Board of
   Directors (or committees thereof) without a meeting); (b) see that all
   notices are duly given in accordance with the provisions of these bylaws
   or as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law; (c) be custodian
   of the corporate records and of the seal of the corporation and see that
   the seal of the corporation is affixed to all documents the execution of
   which on behalf of the corporation under its seal is duly authorized; (d)
   maintain a record of the shareholders of the corporation, in a form that
   permits preparation of a list of the names and addresses of all
   shareholders, by class or series of shares and showing the number and
   class or series of shares held by each shareholder; (e) sign with the
   President, or a Vice President, certificates for shares of the
   corporation, the issuance of which shall have been authorized by
   resolution of the Board of Directors; (f) have general charge of the stock
   transfer books of the corporation; and (g) in general perform all duties
   incident to the office of Secretary and have such other duties and
   exercise such authority as from time to time may be delegated or assigned
   by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or by the Board of
   Directors.

             4.11.   The Treasurer.  The Treasurer shall:  (a) have charge
   and custody of and be responsible for all funds and securities of the
   corporation; (b) maintain appropriate accounting records; (c) receive and
   give receipts for moneys due and payable to the corporation from any
   source whatsoever, and deposit all such moneys in the name of the
   corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositaries as shall
   be selected in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04; and (d) in
   general perform all of the duties incident to the office of Treasurer and
   have such other duties and exercise such other authority as from time to
   time may be delegated or assigned by the Chief Executive Officer or by the
   Board of Directors.  If required by the Board of Directors, the Treasurer
   shall give a bond for the faithful discharge of his or her duties in such
   sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of Directors shall
   determine.

             4.12.   Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers.  There
   shall be such number of Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers as
   the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer may from time to
   time authorize.  The Assistant Secretaries may sign with the President or
   a Vice President certificates for shares of the corporation the issuance
   of which shall have been authorized by a resolution of the Board of
   Directors.  The Assistant Treasurers shall respectively, if required by
   the Board of Directors, give bonds for the faithful discharge of their
   duties in such sums and with such sureties as the Board of Directors shall
   determine.  The Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers, in
   general, shall perform such duties and have such authority as shall from
   time to time be delegated or assigned to them by the Secretary or the
   Treasurer, respectively, or by the Chief Executive Officer, the President
   or the Board of Directors.

             4.13.   Other Assistants and Acting Officers.  The Board of
   Directors and the Chief Executive Officer shall have the power to appoint,
   or to authorize any duly appointed officer of the corporation to appoint,
   any person to act as assistant to any officer, or as agent for the
   corporation in his or her stead, or to perform the duties of such officer
   whenever for any reason it is impracticable for such officer to act
   personally, and such assistant or acting officer or other agent so
   appointed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer shall
   have the power to perform all the duties of the office to which he or she
   is so appointed to be an assistant, or as to which he or she is so
   appointed to act, except as such power may be otherwise defined or
   restricted by the Board of Directors or the appointing officer.

             4.14.   Salaries.  The salaries of the principal officers shall
   be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors or by a duly
   authorized committee thereof, and no officer shall be prevented from
   receiving such salary by reason of the fact that he or she is also a
   director of the corporation.

                      ARTICLE V.  CONTRACTS, LOANS, CHECKS
                      AND DEPOSITS; SPECIAL CORPORATE ACTS

             5.01.   Contracts.  The Board of Directors may authorize any
   officer or officers, agent or agents, to enter into any contract or
   execute or deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
   corporation, and such authorization may be general or confined to specific
   instances.  In the absence of other designation, all deeds, mortgages and
   instruments of assignment or pledge made by the corporation shall be
   executed in the name of the corporation by the Chief Executive Officer,
   the President or one of the Vice Presidents and by the Secretary, an
   Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; the

   of the Board of Directors.

             5.04.   Deposits.  All funds of the corporation not otherwise
   employed shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the

   Directors.

             5.05.   Voting of Securities Owned by this Corporation.  Subject
   always to the specific directions of the Board of Directors, (a) any
   shares or other securities issued by any other corporation and owned or
   controlled by this corporation may be voted at any meeting of security
   holders of such other corporation by the President of this corporation if
   he or she be present, or in his or her absence by any Vice President of
   this corporation who may be present, and (b) whenever, in the judgment of
   the President, or in his or her absence, of any Vice President, it is
   desirable for this corporation to execute a proxy or written consent in
   respect to any shares or other securities issued by any other corporation
   and owned by this corporation, such proxy or consent shall be executed in
   the name of this corporation by the President or one of the Vice
   Presidents of this corporation, without necessity of any authorization by
   the Board of Directors, affixation of corporate seal, if any, or
   countersignature or attestation by another officer.  Any person or persons
   designated in the manner above stated as the proxy or proxies of this
   corporation shall have full right, power and authority to vote the shares
   or other securities issued by such other corporation and owned by this
   corporation the same as such shares or other securities might be voted by
   this corporation.

            ARTICLE VI.  CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES; TRANSFER OF SHARES

             6.01.   Certificates for Shares.  Certificates representing
   shares of the corporation shall be in such form, consistent with the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, as shall be determined by the Board of
   Directors.  Such certificates shall be signed by the President or a Vice
   President and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.  All
   certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise
   identified.  The name and address of the person to whom the shares
   represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of
   issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation. 
   All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be
   cancelled and no new certificate shall be issued until the former
   certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and
   cancelled, except as provided in Section 6.06 hereof.

             6.02.   Facsimile Signatures and Seal.  The seal of the
   corporation, if any, on any certificates for shares may be a facsimile. 
   The signature of the President or Vice President and the Secretary or
   Assistant Secretary upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the
   certificate is manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent, or a
   registrar, other than the corporation itself or an employee of the
   corporation.

             6.03.   Signature by Former Officers.  The validity of a share
   certificate is not affected if a person who signed the certificate (either
   manually or in facsimile) no longer holds office when the certificate is
   issued.

             6.04.   Transfer of Shares.  Prior to due presentment of a
   certificate for shares for registration of transfer the corporation may
   treat the registered owner of such shares as the person exclusively
   entitled to vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to have and
   exercise all the rights and power of an owner.  Where a certificate for
   shares is presented to the corporation with a request to register for
   transfer, the corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any other
   person suffering loss as a result of such registration of transfer if (a)
   there were on or with the certificate the necessary endorsements, and (b)
   the corporation had no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has
   discharged any such duty.  The corporation may require reasonable
   assurance that such endorsements are genuine and effective and compliance
   with such other regulations as may be prescribed by or under the authority
   of the Board of Directors.

             6.05.   Restrictions on Transfer.  The face or reverse side of
   each certificate representing shares shall bear a conspicuous notation of
   any restriction imposed by the corporation upon the transfer of such
   shares.

             6.06.   Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  Where the owner
   claims that certificates for shares have been lost, destroyed or
   wrongfully taken, a new certificate shall be issued in place thereof if
   the owner (a) so requests before the corporation has notice that such
   shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, (b) files with the
   corporation a sufficient indemnity bond if required by the Board of
   Directors or any principal officer, and (c) satisfies such other
   reasonable requirements as may be prescribed by or under the authority of
   the Board of Directors.

             6.07.   Consideration for Shares.  The Board of Directors may
   authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible
   or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash,
   promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be
   performed or other securities of the corporation.  Before the corporation
   issues shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the
   consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is
   adequate.  The determination of the Board of Directors is conclusive
   insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares
   relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and
   nonassessable. The corporation may place in escrow shares issued in whole
   or in part for a contract for future services or benefits, a promissory
   note, or other property to be issued in the future, or make other
   arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit
   distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until
   the services are performed, the benefits or property are received or the
   promissory note is paid.  If the services are not performed, the benefits
   or property are not received or the promissory note is not paid, the
   corporation may cancel, in whole or in part, the shares escrowed or
   restricted and the distributions credited.

             6.08.   Stock Regulations.  The Board of Directors shall have
   the power and authority to make all such further rules and regulations not
   inconsistent with law as it may deem expedient concerning the issue,
   transfer and registration of shares of the corporation.

                               ARTICLE VII.  SEAL

             7.01.   The Board of Directors may provide for a corporate seal
   for the corporation.

   in which the Director or Officer is a Party because he or she is a
   Director or Officer.

             8.03.   Procedural Requirements.

             (a)  A Director or Officer who seeks indemnification under
   Section 8.02 shall make a written request therefor to the Corporation. 
   Subject to Section 8.03(b), within sixty days of the Corporation's receipt
   of such request, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse the Director or
   Officer for the entire amount of Liabilities incurred by the Director or
   Officer in connection with the subject Proceeding (net of any Expenses
   previously advanced pursuant to Section 8.05).

             (b)  No indemnification shall be required to be paid by the
   Corporation pursuant to Section 8.02 if, within such sixty-day period, (i)
   a Disinterested Quorum, by a majority vote thereof, determines that the
   Director or Officer requesting indemnification engaged in misconduct
   constituting a Breach of Duty or (ii) a Disinterested Quorum cannot be
   obtained.

             (c)  In either case of nonpayment pursuant to Section 8.03(b),
   the Board shall immediately authorize by resolution that an Authority, as
   provided in Section 8.04, determine whether the Director's or Officer's
   conduct constituted a Breach of Duty and, therefore, whether
   indemnification should be denied hereunder.

             (d)  (i) If the Board does not authorize an Authority to
   determine the Director's or Officer's right to indemnification hereunder
   within such sixty-day period and/or (ii) if indemnification of the
   requested amount of Liabilities is paid by the Corporation, then it shall
   be conclusively presumed for all purposes that a Disinterested Quorum has
   affirmatively determined that the Director or Officer did not engage in
   misconduct constituting a Breach of Duty and, in the case of subsection
   (i) above (but not subsection (ii)), indemnification by the Corporation of
   the requested amount of Liabilities shall be paid to the Director or
   Officer immediately.

             8.04.   Determination of Indemnification.

             (a)  If the Board authorizes an Authority to determine a
   Director's or Officer's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.03,
   then the Director or Officer requesting indemnification shall have the
   absolute discretionary authority to select one of the following as such
   Authority:

             (i)  An independent legal counsel; provided, that such
        counsel shall be mutually selected by such Director or Officer
        and by a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum or, if a
        Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote
        of the Board;

             (ii) A panel of three arbitrators selected from the panels
        of arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association in
        Wisconsin; provided, that (A) one arbitrator shall be selected
        by such Director or Officer, the second arbitrator shall be
        selected by a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum or, if a
        Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote
        of the Board, and the third arbitrator shall be selected by the
        two previously selected arbitrators, and (B) in all other
        respects (other than this Article VIII), such panel shall be
        governed by the American Arbitration Association's then existing
        Commercial Arbitration Rules; or

             (iii)   A court pursuant to and in accordance with Section
        180.0854 of the Statute.

             (b)  In any such determination by the selected Authority there
   shall exist a rebuttable presumption that the Director's or Officer's
   conduct did not constitute a Breach of Duty and that indemnification
   against the requested amount of Liabilities is required.  The burden of
   rebutting such a presumption by clear and convincing evidence shall be on
   the Corporation or such other party asserting that such indemnification
   should not be allowed.

             (c)  The Authority shall make its determination within sixty
   days of being selected and shall submit a written opinion of its
   conclusion simultaneously to both the Corporation and the Director or
   Officer.

             (d)  If the Authority determines that indemnification is
   required hereunder, the Corporation shall pay the entire requested amount
   of Liabilities (net of any Expenses previously advanced pursuant to
   Section 8.05), including interest thereon at a reasonable rate, as
   determined by the Authority, within ten days of receipt of the Authority's
   opinion; provided, that, if it is determined by the Authority that a
   Director or Officer is entitled to indemnification against Liabilities'
   incurred in connection with some claims, issues or matters, but not as to
   other claims, issues or matters, involved in the subject Proceeding, the
   Corporation shall be required to pay (as set forth above) only the amount
   of such requested Liabilities as the Authority shall deem appropriate in
   light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding.

             (e)  The determination by the Authority that indemnification is
   required hereunder shall be binding upon the Corporation regardless of any
   prior determination that the Director or Officer engaged in a Breach of
   Duty.

             (f)  All Expenses incurred in the determination process under
   this Section 8.04 by either the Corporation or the Director or Officer,
   including, without limitation, all Expenses of the selected Authority,
   shall be paid by the Corporation.

             8.05.   Mandatory Allowance of Expenses.

             (a)  The Corporation shall pay or reimburse from time to time or
   at any time, within ten days after the receipt of the Director's or
   Officer's written request therefor, the reasonable Expenses of the
   Director or Officer as such Expenses are incurred; provided, the following
   conditions are satisfied:

             (i)  The Director or Officer furnishes to the Corporation
        an executed written certificate affirming his or her good faith
        belief that he or she has not engaged in misconduct which
        constitutes a Breach of Duty; and

             (ii) The Director or Officer furnishes to the Corporation
        an unsecured executed written agreement to repay any advances
        made under this Section 8.05 if it is ultimately determined by
        an Authority that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by
        the Corporation for such Expenses pursuant to Section 8.04.

             (b)  If the Director or Officer must repay any previously
   advanced Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.05, such Director or Officer
   shall not be required to pay interest on such amounts.

             8.06.   Indemnification and Allowance of Expenses of Certain
   Others.

             (a)  The Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion as it
   deems appropriate, pursuant to a majority vote thereof, indemnify a
   director or officer of an Affiliate (who is not otherwise serving as a
   Director or Officer) against all Liabilities, and shall advance the
   reasonable Expenses, incurred by such director or officer in a Proceeding
   to the same extent hereunder as if such director or officer incurred such
   Liabilities because he or she was a Director or Officer, if such director
   or officer is a Party thereto because he or she is or was a director or
   officer of the Affiliate.

             (b)  The Corporation shall indemnify an employee who is not a
   Director or Officer, to the extent he or she has been successful on the
   merits or otherwise in defense of a Proceeding, for all reasonable
   Expenses incurred in the Proceeding if the employee was a Party because he
   or she was an employee of the Corporation.

             (c)  The Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion as it
   deems appropriate, pursuant to a majority vote thereof, indemnify (to the
   extent not otherwise provided in Section 8.06(b) hereof) against
   Liabilities incurred by, and/or provide for the allowance of reasonable
   Expenses of, an employee or authorized agent of the Corporation acting
   within the scope of his or her duties as such and who is not otherwise a
   Director or Officer.

             8.07.   Insurance.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain
   insurance on behalf of a Director or Officer or any individual who is or
   was an employee or authorized agent of the Corporation against any
   Liability asserted against or incurred by such individual in his or her
   capacity as such or arising from his or her status as such, regardless of
   whether the Corporation is required or permitted to indemnify against any
   such Liability under this Article VIII.

             8.08.   Notice to the Corporation.  A Director, Officer or
   employee shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing when he or she
   has actual knowledge of a Proceeding which may result in a claim of
   indemnification against Liabilities or allowance of Expenses hereunder,
   but the failure to do so shall not relieve the Corporation of any
   liability to the Director, Officer or employee hereunder unless the
   Corporation shall have been irreparably prejudiced by such failure (as
   determined, in the case of Directors or Officers only, by an Authority
   selected pursuant to Section 8.04(a)).

             8.09.   Severability.  If any provision of this Article VIII
   shall be deemed invalid or inoperative, or if a court of competent
   jurisdiction determines that any of the provisions of this Article VIII
   contravene public policy, this Article VIII shall be construed so that the
   remaining provisions shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force
   and effect, and any such provisions which are invalid or inoperative or
   which contravene public policy shall be deemed, without further action or
   deed by or on behalf of the Corporation, to be modified, amended and/or
   limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same valid and
   enforceable; it being understood that it is the Corporation's intention to
   provide the Directors and Officers with the broadest possible protection
   against personal liability allowable under the Statute.

             8.10.   Nonexclusivity of Article VIII.  The rights of a
   Director, Officer or employee (or any other person) granted under this
   Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
   indemnification against Liabilities or allowance of Expenses which the
   Director, Officer or employee (or such other person) may be entitled to
   under any written agreement, Board resolution, vote of shareholders of the
   Corporation or otherwise, including, without limitation, under the
   Statute.  Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall be deemed to limit
   the Corporation's obligations to indemnify against Liabilities or allow
   Expenses to a Director, Officer or employee under the Statute.

             8.11.   Contractual Nature of Article VIII; Repeal or Limitation
   of Rights.  This Article VIII shall be deemed to be a contract between the
   Corporation and each Director, Officer and employee of the Corporation and
   any repeal or other limitation of this Article VIII or any repeal or
   limitation of the Statute or any other applicable law shall not limit any
   rights of indemnification against Liabilities or allowance of Expenses
   then existing or arising out of events, acts or omissions occurring prior
   to such repeal or limitation, including, without limitation, the right to
   indemnification against Liabilities or allowance of Expenses for
   Proceedings commenced after such repeal or limitation to enforce this
   Article VIII with regard to acts, omissions or events arising prior to
   such repeal or limitation.

                             ARTICLE IX.  AMENDMENTS

             9.01.   By Shareholders.  These bylaws may be amended or
   repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by the shareholders at any annual
   or special meeting of the shareholders at which a quorum is in attendance.

             9.02.   By Directors.  Except as otherwise provided by the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the articles of incorporation, these
   bylaws may also be amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by
   the Board of Directors by affirmative vote of a majority of the number of
   directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is in attendance;
   provided, however, that the shareholders in adopting, amending or
   repealing a particular bylaw may provide therein that the Board of
   Directors may not amend, repeal or readopt that bylaw.

             9.03.   Implied Amendments.  Any action taken or authorized by
   the shareholders or by the Board of Directors which would be inconsistent
   with the bylaws then in effect but which is taken or authorized by
   affirmative vote of not less than the number of shares or the number of
   directors required to amend the bylaws so that the bylaws would be
   consistent with such action shall be given the same effect as though the
   bylaws had been temporarily amended or suspended so far, but only so far,
   as is necessary to permit the specific action so taken or authorized.

   This Agreement is made this ________ day of _____________________,
   19_____, by and between APPLEBEE'S INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Delaware
   corporation ("FRANCHISOR"), MARCUS RESTAURANTS, INC., a Wisconsin
   corporation ("DEVELOPER") and                      N/A        
   (collectively, the "PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS" and, individually, a
   "PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER" of Developer).


   WITNESSETH:

                                    RECITALS

       A.  Franchisor has acquired rights to develop and operate a unique
   system of restaurants which specialize in the sale of high quality,
   moderately priced food and alcoholic beverages in an attractive, casual
   setting, which include proprietary rights in certain valuable trade names,
   service marks and trademarks, including the service mark Applebee's
   Neighborhood Grill & Bar and variations of such mark, designs, decor and
   color schemes for restaurant premises, signs, equipment, procedures and
   formulae for preparing food and beverage products, specifications for
   certain food and beverage products, inventory methods, operating methods,
   financial control concepts, a training facility and teaching
   techniques (the "System").

       B.  Franchisor has determined to establish, through its own
   development and operation, and through the granting of franchises, a chain
   of Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar restaurants which are distinctive;
   which are similar in appearance, design and decor; and which are uniform
   in operation and product consistency.

       C.  The value of Franchisor's trade names, service marks and
   trademarks is based upon:  (1) the maintenance of uniform high quality
   standards in connection with the preparation and sale of
   Franchisor-approved food and beverage products, (2) the uniform high
   standards of appearance of the individual restaurant units in the System,
   (3) the use of distinctive trademarks, service marks, building designs and
   advertising signs representing a uniformly high quality of product and
   services, and (4) the assumption by Franchisor and its franchisees of the
   obligation to maintain and enhance the goodwill and public acceptance of
   the System (and of Franchisor's trade names, service marks and trademarks)
   by strict adherence to the high standards required by Franchisor.

       D.  Developer desires to obtain the exclusive right to develop
   restaurant units franchised by Franchisor within the geographic area
   specified in Appendix A hereto ("Territory"), for the period specified in
   Subsection 1.1, pursuant to the terms, conditions and provisions which are
   set forth in this Agreement.

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Franchisor granting to Developer the
   exclusive right to develop restaurant units franchised by Franchisor which
   employ the System ("Restaurants") in the Territory for such period, and in
   consideration of the mutual obligations which are provided for herein, it
   is hereby agreed as follows:


   1.  GRANT OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS

       1.1    Franchisor grants Developer the exclusive right to develop
   Restaurants only in the Territory for a period commencing on the date
   hereof and expiring on November 27, 2009, unless sooner terminated as
   hereinafter provided.  Developer has no rights under this Agreement to
   develop Restaurants outside of the Territory.

       1.2    During the term of this Agreement, Franchisor shall not
   operate a restaurant utilizing the System or license any other person to
   operate a restaurant utilizing the System in the Territory.

       1.3    After this Agreement expires or is terminated, Franchisor
   shall have the complete and unrestricted right to operate or license other
   persons to operate a restaurant utilizing the System in the Territory.


   2.  INITIAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE

       2.1    Developer shall develop a total of ten (10)* Restaurants
   franchised by Franchisor in the Territory during the period commencing on
   the date hereof and expiring on December 31, 1997, in accordance with the
   following development schedule:

        *This figure does not include eight (8) Restaurants located in the
   Territory for which franchise agreements have been previously issued, the
   locations of said Restaurants being more specifically described on
   Schedule 1, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

            (a)   During the first Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop at least two (2) Restaurants within
       the Territory, each of which shall be open for operation and doing
       business on December 31, 1994 (the end of the first Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (b)   During the second Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of three (3) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on June 30, 1995 (the end of the second Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (c)   During the third Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of four (4) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on September 30, 1995 (the end of the third Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (d)   During the fourth Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of five (5) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on December 31, 1995 (the end of the fourth Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (e)   During the fifth Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of six (6) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on June 30, 1996 (the end of the fifth Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (f)   During the sixth Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of seven (7) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on September 30, 1996 (the end of the sixth Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (g)   During the seventh Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of eight (8) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on December 31, 1996 (the end of the seventh Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (h)   During the eighth Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of nine (9) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on June 30, 1997 (the end of the eighth Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

            (i)   During the ninth Initial Development Period under this
       Agreement, Developer shall develop the number of Restaurants within
       the Territory necessary to result in the existence of ten (10) such
       Restaurants developed by Developer which are open for operation and
       doing business on December 31, 1997 (the end of the ninth Initial
       Development Period under this Agreement).

   Each of the periods specified in Subparagraphs (a) through (i) hereof is
   sometimes referred to hereinafter as an "Initial Development Period." 

       2.2    During any Initial Development Period, subject to the
   provisions of this Agreement, Developer is free to develop more than the
   total minimum number of Restaurants which Developer is required to develop
   during that Initial Development Period.  Any such Restaurants developed,
   open for operation and doing business during an Initial Development Period
   in excess of the minimum number required to be developed during that
   Initial Development Period shall be applied to satisfy Developer's
   development obligation during the next succeeding Initial Development
   Period or next succeeding Subsequent Development Period (as defined in
   Section 3 hereof), if any, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the above,
   Developer shall not develop more than the total number Restaurants
   approved by Franchisor for development under this Agreement.

       2.3    Strict compliance with the development schedule specified in
   Subsection 2.1 hereof is of the essence of this Agreement.  If Developer
   fails to fulfill its specified development obligation with respect to any
   of the Initial Development Periods specified in Subsection 2.1 hereof,
   this Agreement shall terminate sixty (60) days after the end of the
   Initial Development Period in question, unless by the end of such
   sixty (60) day period Developer has fulfilled the development obligation
   relating to such Initial Development Period.


   3.  SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE; DEVELOPMENT
       OBLIGATIONS GENERALLY

       3.1    During the period commencing on January 1, 1998 and expiring
   on November 27, 2009, Developer shall develop and open for business in the
   Territory, from time to time in accordance with the development schedule
   established under Subsection 3.2, that number of additional Restaurants as
   is required to achieve at the end of such period a total number of
   Restaurants open for business within the Territory which, after including
   the Restaurants developed during the Initial Development Periods, would be
   equal to (a) one (1) Restaurant for every twenty-five thousand (25,000)
   households within the Territory having an income of twenty-five thousand
   dollars ($25,000) or more, or (b) one (1) Restaurant for every
   seventy-five thousand (75,000) individuals within the Territory who are
   between the ages of twenty (20) and forty-nine (49) years old, whichever
   computation results in a lesser number of Restaurants.

       3.2     (a)    Each consecutive twelve (12) month period, commencing
   with the period beginning on January 1, 1998, is hereafter referred to as
   a "Subsequent Development Period."  Each period consisting of two (2)
   consecutive Subsequent Development Periods, commencing with the period
   beginning on January 1, 1998, is hereinafter referred to as a "Calculation
   Period."

            (b)   Franchisor and Developer shall agree in writing on or
   before the commencement of each Calculation Period on the number of
   Restaurants which Developer must develop, each of which shall be open for
   operation and doing business, during each of the two (2) Subsequent
   Development Periods included in such Calculation Period; provided that
   such agreement is subject to the following minimum and maximum development
   requirements:  (i) Minimum development requirements:  Developer hereby
   agrees to develop during each Subsequent Development Period at least that
   number of Restaurants, each of which shall be open for operation and doing
   business, which will be equal to one-third (1/3) of the total number of
   Restaurants (rounded to the nearest whole number) which were required to
   be developed by Developer during all prior Initial Development and
   Calculation Periods; and (ii) Maximum development requirements: 
   Notwithstanding the minimum development requirements, Developer shall not
   be required to develop during any Subsequent Development Period more than
   that number of Restaurants which, when added to the number of Restaurants
   which were required to be developed by Developer during all prior Initial
   Development and Calculation Periods, would exceed the number of
   Restaurants prescribed by the formula set forth in Subsection 3.1, if such
   formula had been applied to determine the total number of Restaurants
   required to service the Territory immediately prior to the Calculation
   Period in question.  No later than sixty (60) days prior to the
   commencement of each Calculation Period, Franchisor shall provide
   Developer with census data necessary for Developer to ascertain, for
   purposes of the maximum development requirements, the number of
   Restaurants which would be required in the Territory by application of the
   formula.  Franchisor shall use census figures provided by National
   Decision Systems, or such other generally recognized demographic service
   as Developer and Franchisor shall reasonably designate.

       3.3    Strict compliance with the development schedule established in
   accordance with Subsection 3.2 hereof is of the essence of this Agreement. 
   If Developer shall fail to fulfill its specified development obligation
   with respect to any Subsequent Development Period, this Agreement shall
   automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the end of the Subsequent
   Development Period in question, unless by the end of such sixty (60) day
   period Developer has fulfilled the development obligation relating to such
   Subsequent Development Period.

       3.4    If, during the term of this Agreement, (a) Developer transfers
   or disposes of any Restaurant developed hereunder in accordance with the
   provisions hereof, or for any other reason ceases to operate any
   Restaurant developed hereunder, and (b) after such transfer or other
   cessation of operation the premises no longer are utilized for the
   operation of a Restaurant, Developer's development obligation in the
   Initial or Subsequent Development Period in which such transfer or other
   cessation of operations occurred shall increase, subject to the general
   limitations on Developer's development obligations set forth in Section 2
   and Section 3, by the number of Restaurants which Developer so
   transferred, disposed of or which otherwise ceased to operate.

       3.5    Franchisor represents that it is the sole owner of the service
   mark Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar.  If Franchisor determines that a
   third person has rights under the law of any state with respect to such
   mark which precludes Developer from fulfilling any portion of its
   development obligations pursuant to this Agreement, Franchisor and
   Developer shall negotiate in good faith for a revision of those
   development obligations, a redefinition of the Territory, or such other
   modifications of this Agreement as may be reasonable in the circumstances.


   4.  FRANCHISE FEE AND ROYALTY RATE

       4.1    Developer shall pay Franchisor a franchise fee of $35,000 with
   respect to each Restaurant which is developed pursuant to this Agreement
   during the Initial Development Periods.  Thereafter, Developer shall pay
   Franchisor a franchise fee in an amount which is equal to the amount of
   the franchise fee then in effect at the time of the issuance of the
   franchise agreement for each additional restaurant to be opened during any
   Subsequent Development Period.  The amount of the franchise fee shall be
   set forth in the franchise offering circular received by the Developer
   from Franchisor immediately preceding the issuance of such franchise
   agreement.  Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Developer
   shall pay to Franchisor, by certified check, the amount of $35,000
   ("Franchise Fee Deposit").  Said Franchise Fee Deposit shall be equal to
   the greater of (a) the franchise fee for one of the Restaurants to be
   developed during the Initial Development Periods, or (b) ten percent (10%)
   of the entire franchise fees covering the ten (10) Restaurants to be
   developed during the first nine (9) Initial Development Periods pursuant
   to this Agreement (as reduced by a credit of $6,000 based on Developer's
   prior payment, if so paid, of a non-refundable $6,000 application fee). 
   The remaining balance of the franchise fees for each of the Restaurants to
   be developed during the nine (9) Initial Development Periods shall be paid
   by certified check as follows:  one-half (1/2) of the balance shall be
   paid upon signing a franchise agreement for that Restaurant and the
   remaining balance shall be paid fourteen (14) days prior to the scheduled
   opening of the Restaurant.  The Franchise Fee Deposit shall be
   proportionately allocated to the franchise fee due with respect to each
   Restaurant to which it applies.  The franchise fee with respect to each
   Restaurant to be developed during a Subsequent Development Period or with
   respect to any additional Restaurants developed during the Initial
   Development Periods shall be paid by certified check in the same manner.

       4.2    Except as provided in this Subsection 4.2 and in
   Subsection 19.1 of the form of franchise agreement which is attached
   hereto as Appendix B, Developer shall have no right to recover from
   Franchisor, directly or indirectly, any of the franchise fees which are
   prepaid pursuant to Subsection 4.1 hereof.  If Developer's failure to
   develop the total number of Restaurants specified in Subsection 2.1 of
   this Agreement is the result of the assertion of rights by a third party
   as described in Subsection 3.5 hereof, those prepaid franchise fees which
   relate to the Restaurants which cannot be so developed shall be refunded
   to Developer in cash.

       4.3    As partial consideration for the rights granted to Developer
   pursuant to the franchise agreements covering the Restaurants which
   Developer develops hereunder, Developer (as franchisee under each such
   franchise agreement) shall pay Franchisor a monthly royalty fee as
   determined by Franchisor, not to exceed five percent (5%) of each calendar
   month's gross sales (as that term is defined in the form of franchise
   agreement which is attached hereto as Appendix B).

       4.4    Pursuant to its obligations hereunder and under the applicable
   franchise agreements, Franchisor will make various expenditures in
   connection with the development of prospective Restaurant sites by
   Developer, including expenditures for travel, lodging, meals, obtaining of
   information about prospective sites, demographic information, traffic
   counts, and inquiries into local laws and ordinances.  Developer shall
   promptly notify Franchisor of a decision to cease development of a
   prospective Restaurant site.  In the event that Developer fails to open a
   restaurant at any such site, in lieu of the payment of the franchise fee
   therefor, Franchisor in its sole discretion may require Developer to
   reimburse Franchisor for Franchisor's expenditures with respect to that
   site.  In such event, Franchisor shall provide Developer with an itemized
   list of Franchisor's expenditures with respect to that site within
   thirty (30) business days after Franchisor receives notice that Developer
   no longer intends to develop a Restaurant at that site, and Developer
   shall reimburse Franchisor for such costs within thirty (30) days after
   receiving such list.


   5.  SITE APPROVALS:  PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS

       5.1    Developer assumes all cost, liability, expense and
   responsibility for locating, obtaining, financing and developing sites for
   Restaurants, and for constructing and equipping Restaurants at such sites. 
   To assist Developer in the site selection process, Franchisor will provide
   Developer with certain demographic information regarding the site, will
   conduct an on-site inspection and will review any lease or contract under
   negotiation for the prospective site, such services to be provided to
   Developer at no additional cost.  The development of a Restaurant at any
   site must be approved by Franchisor in accordance with its then-existing
   site approval procedure.  In connection with a request for approval of a
   proposed site for a Restaurant, Franchisee shall provide a related
   contract of sale or lease agreement and such other information and
   material as the Franchisor may reasonably require.  Franchisor's approval
   of a prospective Restaurant site shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
   Franchisor shall notify Developer whether it approves a proposed site and
   the related contract of sale or lease agreement within thirty (30)
   business days of receiving Developer's request for approval.  Failure of
   Franchisor to so notify Developer within such thirty (30) business day
   period shall be deemed to be an approval of such site and the related
   contract of sale or lease agreement.  Developer acknowledges that
   Franchisor's approval of a prospective site for a Restaurant does not
   constitute a representation, promise or guarantee by Franchisor that a
   Restaurant operated at that site will be profitable or otherwise
   successful.  Developer shall not make any binding commitment to a
   prospective vendor or lessor of real estate with respect to a site for a
   Restaurant unless Franchisor has approved that site in accordance with
   Franchisor's then-existing site approval procedure.  After Franchisor has
   approved a site for a Restaurant, Franchisee shall provide Franchisor with
   a copy of the executed contract of sale or lease, as applicable, relating
   to the site within a reasonable period of time.

       5.2    For each Restaurant which Developer develops pursuant to this
   Agreement, Franchisor will make available to Developer Franchisor's
   specifications for a typical Restaurant.  Developer will obtain
   architectural and engineering services independently and at its own
   expense.  Franchisor shall have the right to review all such architectural
   and/or engineering plans which Developer obtains and to prohibit the
   implementation of any plan, or part thereof, which Franchisor, in its sole
   and absolute discretion, believes is not consistent with the best
   interests of the System.  In the event that Franchisor desires to prohibit
   the implementation of any such plan, or part thereof, Franchisor shall so
   notify Developer within thirty (30) business days of receiving such
   architectural and/or engineering plans for review.  Failure of Franchisor
   to so notify Developer within such thirty (30) business day period shall
   be deemed to be an approval of such plans.  In the event Franchisor does
   object to any such plan, Franchisor shall provide Developer with a
   reasonable detailed list of changes necessary to make such plans
   acceptable to Franchisor.  Franchisor shall, upon resubmission of such
   plans, with such changes as Developer has prepared, notify Developer
   within fifteen (15) business days of receiving such plans whether they are
   acceptable.  Failure to so notify Developer within such fifteen (15)
   business day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such amended
   plans.

       5.3    If Developer acquires a leasehold interest in a site, that
   leasehold interest shall be for a term which is at least as long as the
   term of the form of franchise agreement which is attached hereto as
   Appendix B, and the lease shall provide that if the applicable franchise
   agreement is terminated prior to the expiration of that term for whatever
   reason, Developer may assign the lease to Franchisor without the lessor
   having any right to impose conditions on such assignment or to obtain any
   payment in connection therewith.


   6.  FEES AND FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS

       Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the scheduled opening of any
   Restaurant which has been developed pursuant to this Agreement, Developer
   shall deliver to Franchisor an executed franchise agreement substantially
   in the form which is attached hereto as Appendix B, provided however, that
   the franchise agreement which Developer executes shall require the payment
   of a franchise fee in the amount described in Subsection 4.1, royalty fees
   as described in Subsection 4.3, and advertising payments at the rates then
   established by Franchisor with respect to new Restaurants, except that in
   no event shall such rates exceed five percent (5%) of a Restaurant's gross
   sales (as defined in Subsection 9.3 of the form of a franchise agreement
   which is attached hereto as Appendix B).


   7.  DEVELOPER ORGANIZATION, AUTHORITY, FINANCIAL
       CONDITION AND SHAREHOLDERS

       7.1    Developer and each Principal Shareholder represent and warrant
   that:  (a) Developer is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
   and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation;
   (b) Developer is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in
   good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which its
   business activities or the nature of the properties owned by it requires
   such qualification; (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
   the transactions contemplated hereby are within Developer's corporate
   power; (d) the execution and delivery of this Agreement have been duly
   authorized by the Developer; (e) the articles of incorporation and by-laws
   of Developer delivered to Franchisor are true, complete and correct, and
   there have been no changes therein since the date thereof; (f) the
   certified copies of the minutes electing the officers of Developer and
   authorizing the execution and delivery of this Agreement are true, correct
   and complete, and there have been no changes therein since the date(s)
   thereof; (g) the specimen stock certificate delivered to Franchisor is a
   true specimen of Developer's stock certificate; (h) the financial
   statement of Developer and financial statements of its Principal
   Shareholders, heretofore delivered to Franchisor, are true, complete and
   correct, and fairly present the financial positions of Developer and each
   Principal Shareholder, respectively, as of the date thereof; (i) such
   financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
   accepted accounting principles; and (j) there have been no materially
   adverse changes in the condition, assets or liabilities of Developer or
   Principal Shareholders since the date or dates thereof.

       7.2    Developer and each Principal Shareholder covenant that during
   the term of this Agreement:  (a) Developer shall do or cause to be done
   all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force its corporate
   existence and shall be in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
   jurisdiction in which its business activities or the nature of the
   properties owned by it requires such qualification; (b) Developer shall
   have the corporate authority to carry out the terms of this Agreement; and
   (c) Developer shall print, in a conspicuous fashion on all certificates
   representing shares of its stock when issued, a legend referring to this
   Agreement and the restrictions on and obligations of Developer and
   Principal Shareholders hereunder, including the restrictions on transfer
   of Developer's shares.

       7.3    Prior to development of the first Restaurant pursuant to this
   Agreement, Developer shall maintain an average monthly balance of five
   hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in liquid assets.  For purposes of
   this Agreement, "liquid assets" shall consist of cash, cash available to
   Developer pursuant to an irrevocable line of credit issued by a commercial
   bank in favor of Developer, marketable securities, or any other similar
   asset in which Franchisor's Chief Financial Officer designates in writing
   as a liquid asset.  After development of the first Restaurant pursuant to
   this Agreement, and at any time thereafter in which Developer is operating
   one (1) Restaurant in the Territory, Developer shall maintain an average
   monthly balance of three hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($325,000)
   in liquid assets.  After development of the second Restaurant pursuant to
   this Agreement, and thereafter, so long as Developer is operating at least
   two (2) Restaurants in the Territory, Developer shall maintain an average
   monthly balance of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) in liquid
   assets.  At all times Developer shall maintain the necessary financial
   resources to satisfy its development obligations hereunder.

       7.4    In addition to its obligations pursuant to Subsections 7.1 and
   7.3 hereof, Developer and Principal Shareholders shall provide Franchisor
   with such financial information as Franchisor may reasonably request from
   time to time, including, on an annual basis, copies of the then-most
   current financial statements of Developer and each Principal Shareholder,
   dated as of the end of the last preceding fiscal year of the Developer or
   Principal Shareholder, said statements to be delivered to Franchisor no
   later than April 15 of each year.

       7.5    Developer and each Principal Shareholder represent, warrant
   and covenant that all Interests (as defined in Subsection 8.4 hereto) in
   Developer are owned as set forth on Appendix C hereto, that no Interest
   has been pledged or hypothecated (except in accordance with Section 8 of
   this Agreement), and that no change will be made in the ownership of any
   such Interest other than as permitted by this Agreement, or otherwise
   consented to in writing by Franchisor.  Developer and Principal
   Shareholders agree to furnish Franchisor with such evidence as Franchisor
   may request, from time to time, for the purpose of assuring Franchisor
   that the Interests of Developer and Principal Shareholders remain as
   represented herein.

       7.6    Each Principal Shareholder, jointly and severally, hereby
   personally and unconditionally guarantees each of Developer's financial
   obligations to Franchisor (including, but not limited to, all obligations
   relating to the payment of fees by Developer to Franchisor).  Each
   Principal Shareholder agrees that Franchisor may resort to such Principal
   Shareholder (or any of them) for payment of any such financial obligation,
   whether or not Franchisor shall have proceeded against Developer, any
   other Principal Shareholder or any other obligor primarily or secondarily
   obligated to Franchisor with respect to such financial obligation.  Each
   Principal Shareholder hereby expressly waives presentment, demand, notice
   of dishonor, protest, and all other notices whatsoever with respect to
   Franchisor's enforcement of this guaranty.  In addition, each Principal
   Shareholder agrees that if the performance or observance by Developer of
   any term or provision hereof is waived or the time of performance thereof
   extended by Franchisor, or payment of any such financial obligation is
   accelerated in accordance with any agreement between Franchisor and any
   party liable in respect thereto or extended or renewed, in whole or in
   part, all as Franchisor may determine, whether or not notice to or consent
   by any Principal Shareholder or any other party liable in respect to such
   financial obligations is given or obtained, such actions shall not affect
   or alter the guaranty of each Principal Shareholder described in this
   Subsection.


   8.  TRANSFER

       8.1    There shall be no Transfer of any Interest of Developer, or of
   a Principal Shareholder in Developer, in whole or in part (whether
   voluntarily or by operation of law), directly, indirectly or contingently,
   except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.  "Transfer"
   and "Interest" are defined in Subsections 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.

       8.2    Except as provided in Subsection 8.3, "Transfer" shall mean
   any assignment, sale, pledge, hypothecation, gift or any other such event
   which would change ownership of or create a new Interest, including, but
   not limited to:

            (a)   any change in the ownership of or rights in or to any
       shares of stock or other equity interest in Developer which would
       result from the act of any shareholder of Developer ("Shareholder"),
       such as a sale, exchange, pledge or hypothecation of shares, or any
       interest in or rights to any of Developer's profits, revenues or
       assets, or any such change which would result by operation of law; and

            (b)   any change in the percentage interest owned by any
       Shareholder in the shares of stock of Developer, or interests in its
       profits, revenues or assets which would result from any act of
       Developer such as a sale, pledge or hypothecation of any Restaurant
       assets (other than a pledge of assets to secure bona fide loans made
       or credit extended in connection with acquisition of the assets
       pledged, provided that immediately before and after such transaction
       Developer satisfies the applicable liquid asset requirement described
       in Subsection 7.3 of this Agreement); any sale or issuance of any
       shares of Developer's stock; the retirement or redemption of any
       shares of Developer's stock; or any sale or grant to any person of any
       right to participate in or otherwise to share or become entitled to
       any part of Developer's profits, revenues, assets or equity.

       8.3    "Transfer" shall not include (a) a change in the ownership of
   or rights to any shares or other equity interest in Developer pursuant to
   a public offering of Developer's securities registered under the
   Securities Act of 1933, or (b) a change in the ownership of or rights to
   any securities or other equity interest in Developer pursuant to a private
   offering of Developer's securities exempted from registration under such
   Act, provided that Developer provides Franchisor with a copy of its S-1
   prospectus and/or offering memorandum ten (10) days prior to its filing
   with the Securities and Exchange Commission or circulation to third
   parties so that Franchisor may comment and, if necessary, correct any
   information concerning Franchisor and/or the System, and further provided
   that after giving effect to any such public or private offering, the
   Principal Shareholders, or any of them, "control" Developer.  For purposes
   of this Section 8, "control" means either (1) holding fifty-one
   percent (51%) or more of the outstanding voting securities of Developer,
   or (2) having the contractual power presently to designate a majority of
   the directors of Developer.

       8.4    "Interest" shall mean:  when referring to interests or rights
   in Developer, any shares of Developer's stock, and any other equitable or
   legal right in or to any of Developer's stock, revenues, profits or
   assets; when referring to rights or assets of Developer, Developer's
   rights under and interest in this Agreement, any Restaurant and its
   revenues, profits and assets.

       8.5     (a)    The Interest of a Principal Shareholder may be
   transferred to such Principal Shareholder's spouse or children or to a
   person designated in such Principal Shareholder's will or trust
   (individually and collectively referred to as "Successor"), upon such
   Principal Shareholder's death or permanent incapacity, without
   Franchisor's approval, provided that such Successor shall agree to be
   bound by the restrictions contained in this Section 8, and the other
   agreements and covenants of the Principal Shareholders contained in this
   Agreement.

            (b)   The Interest of a Principal Shareholder may not be
   transferred to another Principal Shareholder without Franchisor's
   approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

            (c)   The Interest of a Successor may only be transferred in
   accordance with Subsection 8.5(b) or 8.8, regardless of whether such
   Transfer is for consideration or by gift or will or other device.

       8.6    If at any time the Principal Shareholders desire to dispose of
   all or substantially all of the Interests of the Principal Shareholders in
   Developer, or the Principal Shareholders (or Developer) desire to dispose
   of all or substantially all of Developer's Interest in this Agreement or
   in the assets which Developer has acquired pursuant to this Agreement, the
   Principal Shareholders or Developer, as the case may be, shall notify
   Franchisor of that desire, in writing, thirty (30) days before announcing
   that fact publicly or engaging the services of a broker or sales agent.

       8.7     (a)    If at any time any of the Principal Shareholders or
   Developer, as the case may be, obtains from a third party or third parties
   a bona fide offer (the "Offer") in writing for the purchase of all or
   substantially all of the Interests of the Principal Shareholders in
   Developer or of all or substantially all of Developer's Interest in this
   Agreement or in the assets which Developer has acquired pursuant to this
   Agreement, the Principal Shareholders or Developer shall give notice (the
   "Selling Notice") to Franchisor stating that the Principal Shareholders or
   Developer, as the case may be, have received the Offer, identifying the
   prospective purchaser by name and address, specifying the proposed
   purchase price and attaching a true and complete copy of the Offer.

            (b)   Franchisor shall have an option (the "Option"), exercisable
   within a period of forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Selling
   Notice (the "Option Period"), to purchase such Interests at the price and
   on the conditions set forth in the Offer, except that Franchisor shall not
   be obligated to pay any finder's or broker's fee, and if the Offer
   provides for payment of consideration other than cash, or if the Offer
   involves certain intangible benefits, Franchisor may elect to purchase
   such Interests by offering a reasonable cash substitute for the non-cash
   part of the Offer.

            (c)   The Option shall be exercisable by Franchisor delivering to
   the Principal Shareholders or Developer, as the case may be, within the
   Option Period, a notice (i) stating that the Option is being exercised,
   and (ii) specifying the time, date and place at which such purchase and
   sale will take place, which date shall be within forty-five (45) days
   after Franchisor delivers such notice.  The forty-five (45) day limitation
   described at the end of the preceding sentence shall not apply if at the
   end of said forty-five (45) day period the only issue which prevents
   completion of the purchase and sale is the need to effect transfers of the
   applicable liquor licenses.  In the event of such a delay, the purchase
   and sale shall take place within seven (7) business days after those
   liquor licenses have been transferred.

            (d)   If the Option is not exercised, the Principal Shareholders
   or Developer, as the case may be, may sell the Interests in or of
   Developer to the third party which made the Offer, on conditions no more
   favorable to the third-party offerer than those set forth in the Offer,
   provided that Franchisor approves the proposed transferee in accordance
   with the criteria set forth in Appendix D and provided further that such
   sale takes place within ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
   Option Period.  The ninety (90) day limitation described in the preceding
   sentence shall not apply if at the end of said ninety (90) day period the
   only issue which prevents completion of the purchase and sale is the need
   to effect transfers of the applicable liquor licenses.  In the event of
   such a delay, the purchase and sale shall take place within seven (7)
   business days after those liquor licenses have been transferred.

            (e)   If the Option is not exercised, the Principal Shareholders
   or Developer, as the case may be, shall immediately notify Franchisor in
   writing of any change in the terms of an Offer.  Any material change in
   the terms of an Offer shall cause it to be deemed a new Offer, conferring
   upon Franchisor a new Option pursuant to this Subsection 8.7; the Option
   Period with respect to the new Option shall be deemed to commence on the
   day on which Franchisor receives written notice of a material change in
   the terms of the original Offer.

       8.8     (a)    Developer understands and acknowledges that the rights
   and duties set forth in this Agreement are personal to Developer and that
   Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance on the business
   skill and financial capacity of Developer, and the business skill,
   financial capability and personal character of each Principal Shareholder. 
   Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8, the Principal Shareholders
   shall at all times retain control of Developer.  Except as otherwise
   provided in this Section 8, no Transfer of any part of Developer's
   Interest in this Agreement, and no Transfer of any Interest of any
   Principal Shareholder shall be completed except in accordance with this
   Subsection 8.8.  In the event of such a proposed Transfer of any part of
   Developer's Interest in this Agreement, or of any Interest of any
   Principal Shareholder, the party or parties desiring to effect such
   Transfer shall give Franchisor notice in writing of the proposed Transfer,
   which notice shall set forth the name and address of the proposed
   transferee, its financial condition, including a copy of its financial
   statement dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of said
   notice, and all the terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer.  Upon
   receiving such notice, Franchisor may (i) approve the Transfer, or
   (ii) withhold its consent to the Transfer.  Franchisor shall, within
   forty-five (45) days of receiving such notice and all the information
   required therein, advise the party or parties desiring to effect the
   Transfer whether it (1) approves the Transfer, or (2) withholds its
   consent to the Transfer, giving the reasons for such disapproval.  Failure
   of Franchisor to so advise said party or parties within that forty-
   five (45) day period shall be deemed to be approval of the proposed
   Transfer.  Appendix D sets forth the criteria for obtaining Franchisor's
   consent to a proposed Transfer.

            (b)   In the event that Franchisor approves the Transfer, and the
   Transfer is not completed within ninety (90) days of the later of
   (i) expiration of the forty-five (45) day notice period, or (ii) delivery
   of notice of Franchisor's approval of the proposed Transfer, Franchisor's
   approval of the proposed Transfer shall automatically be revoked.  The
   ninety (90) day limitation described in the preceding sentence shall not
   apply if at the end of said ninety (90) day period the only issue which
   prevents completion of the Transfer is the need to effect transfers of the
   applicable liquor licenses.  In the event of such a delay, the Transfer
   shall take place within seven (7) business days after those liquor
   licenses have been transferred.  Any subsequent proposal to complete the
   proposed Transfer shall be subject to Franchisor's right of approval as
   provided herein.  The party which desires to effect the proposed Transfer
   shall immediately notify Franchisor in writing of any change in the terms
   of a Transfer.  Any material change in terms of a Transfer prior to
   closing shall cause it to be deemed a new Transfer, revoking any approval
   previously given by Franchisor and conferring upon Franchisor a new right
   to approve such Transfer, which shall be deemed to commence on the day on
   which Franchisor receives written notice of such change in terms.

       8.9    In connection with any request for Franchisor's approval of a
   proposed Transfer to this Section 8, the parties to the proposed Transfer
   shall pay Franchisor a fee to defray the actual cost of review and the
   administrative and professional expenses related to the proposed Transfer
   and the preparation and execution of documents and agreements, up to a
   maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).


   9.  TERMINATION

       9.1    This Agreement shall expire on November 27, 2009, unless
   sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.

       9.2    Franchisor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
   immediately upon written notice to Developer stating the reason for such
   termination, and Developer shall no longer have any of the rights created
   by this Agreement, in the event of:

            (a)   development by Developer of a Restaurant without first
       obtaining approval from Franchisor of the Restaurant site or of
       Developer's architectural and/or engineering plans in accordance with
       Section 5 hereof;

            (b)   any breach or default of any of the provisions of
       Sections 8 and 11 of this Agreement and Subsection 14.1 of any
       franchise agreement entered into pursuant to this Agreement;

            (c)   the filing by Developer of a petition in bankruptcy, an
       arrangement for the benefit of creditors, or a petition for
       reorganization; the filing against Developer of a petition in
       bankruptcy, an arrangement for the benefit of creditors, or petition
       for reorganization, not dismissed within ninety (90) days of the
       filing thereof; the making of an assignment by Developer for the
       benefit of creditors; or the appointment of a receiver or trustee for
       Developer, which receiver or trustee shall not have been dismissed
       within ninety (90) days of such appointment;

            (d)   the discovery by Franchisor that Developer made any
       material misrepresentation or omitted any material fact in the
       information which was furnished to Franchisor in connection with this
       Agreement;

            (e)   failure by Developer to locate and employ a Director of
       Operations who is approved by Franchisor in accordance with
       Subsection 12.2 within ninety (90) days of the date of this Agreement
       or, with respect to a replacement Director of Operations, failure by
       Developer to locate such a replacement who is approved by Franchisor
       in accordance with Subsection 12.2 within one hundred eighty (180)
       days of the date on which the last Director of Operations who was
       approved by Franchisor ceased to be employed by Developer in that
       capacity;

            (f)   any part of this Agreement relating to the payment of fees
       to Franchisor, or the preservation of any of Franchisor's trade names,
       service marks, trademarks, trade secrets or secret formulae licensed
       or disclosed hereunder or under any franchise agreement between
       Franchisor and Developer, for any reason being declared invalid or
       unenforceable;

            (g)   Developer or any Principal Shareholder being convicted of
       or pleading nolo contendere to a felony or any crime involving moral
       turpitude; or

            (h)   the franchisee under any franchise agreement executed
       pursuant to this Agreement committing a default subject to immediate
       termination under the franchise agreement and Franchisor terminates
       the franchise agreement.

       9.3    Except as provided above in Subsection 9.2, if Developer
   defaults in the performance or observance of any of its other obligations
   hereunder or under any franchise agreement between Developer and
   Franchisor, and any such default continues for a period of thirty (30)
   days after written notice to Developer specifying such default, Franchisor
   shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to
   Developer.  If Developer defaults in the performance or observance of the
   same obligation two (2) or more times within a twelve (12) month period,
   Franchisor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately
   upon commission of the second act of default, upon written notice to
   Developer stating the reason for such termination, without allowance for
   any curative period.

       9.4    This Agreement shall automatically terminate under the
   conditions and at the times specified in Subsection 2.3 and 3.3.


   10.     PREREQUISITES TO OBTAINING FRANCHISES FOR INDIVIDUAL
       RESTAURANT UNITS

       10.1  Developer understands and agrees that this Agreement does not
   confer upon Developer a right to obtain a franchise for any Restaurant,
   but is intended by the parties to set forth the terms and conditions
   which, if fully satisfied, shall entitle Developer to obtain such a
   franchise, located within the Territory.

       10.2  In the event that Developer shall have obtained Franchisor's
   approval of a particular proposed site for a Restaurant, and if
   Franchisor, in the exercise of its sole discretion, has granted Developer
   operational, financial and legal approval, then Franchisor will grant
   Developer a franchise for a Restaurant at the site in question.  As used
   herein, Franchisor will give Developer "operational", "financial" and
   "legal" approval under the following circumstances:

       "Operational" approval will be granted if Franchisor has determined,
       in the exercise of its sole discretion, that Developer is conducting
       the operation of each of its Restaurants, and is capable of conducting
       the operation of the proposed Restaurant, including physical aspects
       thereof, (a) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
       Agreement, (b) in accordance with the provisions of the respective
       franchise agreements, and (c) in accordance with the standards,
       specifications and procedures set forth and described in the Franchise
       Operations Manual and in any other materials or manuals provided or
       made available to Developer by Franchisor (collectively, the
       "Manuals"), as such may be amended from time to time.  Developer
       understands that changes in said standards, specifications and
       procedures may become necessary from time to time.  Developer agrees
       to accept said changes, and Developer further agrees that it is within
       the sole discretion of Franchisor to make said changes.

       "Financial" approval will be granted if (a) Developer is not in breach
       of its obligations under Subsection 7.3 hereof and has been and is
       faithfully performing all terms and conditions under each of its
       existing franchise agreements with Franchisor, (b) Developer or its
       affiliates is not in default of any money obligations owed to
       Franchisor, and (c) Developer is not in default of any financial
       obligation to any of its suppliers, unless any such obligation is
       being disputed in good faith by the Developer.  Developer acknowledges
       and agrees that it is vital to Franchisor's interest that each of its
       franchisees be financially sound to avoid failure of a franchised
       business (which would adversely affect the reputation and good name of
       Franchisor and the System).  Developer acknowledges and agrees that it
       is vital to Franchisor's interest and to the interests of the System
       that Developer (in its capacity as franchisee) remain current in
       satisfying its financial obligations to it suppliers.

       "Legal" approval will be granted if Franchisor has determined, in the
       exercise of its sole discretion, that Developer has submitted to
       Franchisor, in a timely manner as requested, all information and
       documents requested by Franchisor prior to and as a basis for the
       issuance of individual franchises or pursuant to any right granted to
       Franchisor by this Agreement or by any franchise agreement between
       Developer and Franchisor, and has taken such additional actions in
       connection therewith as may be requested from time to time.

       10.3  It is understood and agreed that the foregoing criteria apply to
   the operational, financial and legal aspects of any Restaurant franchised
   by Franchisor in which Developer or any Principal Shareholder has any
   legal or equitable interest.  It is further understood and agreed that
   Developer and Principal Shareholders have an ongoing responsibility to
   operate each Restaurant in which Developer or any Principal Shareholder
   has any legal or equitable interest in a manner which satisfies the
   foregoing requirements for operational, financial and legal approval.


   11.     RESTRICTIONS

       11.1  Developer and its Principal Shareholders acknowledge that over
   the term of this Agreement they are to receive proprietary information
   which Franchisor has developed over time at great expense, including, but
   not limited to, methods of site selection, marketing methods, product
   analysis and selection, and service methods and skills relating to the
   development and operation of Restaurants.  They further acknowledge that
   this information, which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, that
   contained in the Manuals, is not generally known in the industry and is
   beyond their own present skills and experience, and that to develop it
   themselves would be expensive, time-consuming and difficult.  Developer
   and Principal Shareholders further acknowledge that the Franchisor's
   information provides a competitive advantage and will be valuable to them
   in the development of their business, and that gaining access to it is
   therefore a primary reason why they are entering into this Agreement. 
   Accordingly, Developer and its Principal Shareholders agree that
   Franchisor's information, as described above, which may or may not be
   "trade secrets" under prevailing judicial interpretations, is private and
   valuable, and constitutes trade secrets belonging to Franchisor; and in
   consideration of Franchisor's confidential disclosure to them of these
   trade secrets, Developer and Principal Shareholders agree as follows:

            (a)   During the term of this Agreement, neither Developer nor
       any Principal Shareholder, for so long as such Principal Shareholder
       owns an Interest in Developer, may, without the prior written consent
       of Franchisor, directly or indirectly engage in, or acquire any
       financial or beneficial interest (including any interest in
       corporations, partnerships, trusts, unincorporated associations or
       joint ventures) in, advise, help, guarantee loans or make loans to,
       any restaurant business whose menu or method of operation is similar
       to that employed by restaurant units within the System which is either
       (i) located in the Territory, (ii) located in the Area of Dominant
       Influence (as defined and established from time to time by Arbitron
       Ratings Company) of any Restaurant developed pursuant to this
       Agreement, (iii) located within a five (5) mile radius of any
       restaurant unit within the System, or (iv) determined by Franchisor,
       exercising reasonable good faith judgment, to be a direct competitor
       of the System.

            (b)   Neither Developer, for two (2) years following the
       termination of this Agreement, nor any Principal Shareholder, for
       two (2) years following the termination of all of his or her Interest
       in Developer or the termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs
       first, may directly or indirectly engage in or acquire any financial
       or beneficial interest (including any interest in corporations,
       partnerships, trusts, unincorporated associations or joint ventures)
       in, advise, help, guarantee loans or make loans to, any restaurant
       business whose menu or method of operation is similar to that employed
       by restaurant units within the System which is located either (i) in
       the Territory, (ii) in the Area of Dominant Influence (as defined and
       established from time to time by Arbitron Ratings Company) of any
       Restaurant developed pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) within a
       five (5) mile radius of any restaurant unit within the System, or
       (iv) within any area for which an active, currently binding
       development agreement has been granted by Franchisor to another
       franchisee as of the date of termination.

       11.2  Neither Developer nor any Shareholder shall at any time
   (a) appropriate or use the trade secrets incorporated in the System, or
   any portion thereof, in any other restaurant business which is not within
   the System, (b) disclose or reveal any portion of the System to any person
   other than to Developer's employees as an incident of their training,
   (c) acquire any right to use any name, mark or other intellectual property
   right which may be granted pursuant to any agreement between Franchisor
   and Developer, except in connection with the operation of a Restaurant, or
   (d) communicate, divulge or use for the benefit of any other person or
   entity any confidential information, knowledge or know-how concerning the
   methods of development or operation of a restaurant utilizing the System,
   which may be communicated by Franchisor in connection with the Restaurants
   to be developed hereunder.

       11.3  Developer and Principal Shareholders agree that the provisions
   of this Section 11 are and have been a primary inducement to Franchisor to
   enter into this Agreement, and that in the event of breach thereof
   Franchisor would be irreparably injured and would be without an adequate
   remedy at law.  Therefore, in the event of a breach, or a threatened or
   attempted breach, of any of such provisions Franchisor shall be entitled,
   in addition to any other remedies which it may have hereunder or in law or
   in equity (including the right to terminate this Agreement), to a
   preliminary and/or permanent injunction and a decree for specific
   performance of the terms hereof without the necessity of showing actual or
   threatened damage, and without being required to furnish a bond or other
   security.

       11.4  The restrictions contained in Subsection 11.1 above shall not
   apply to ownership of less than two percent (2%) of the shares of a
   company whose shares are listed and traded on a national securities
   exchange if such shares are owned for investment only, and are not owned
   by an officer, director, employee or consultant of such publicly traded
   company.

       11.5  If any court or other tribunal having jurisdiction to determine
   the validity or enforceability of this Section 11 determines that it would
   be invalid or unenforceable as written, then the provisions hereof shall
   be deemed to be modified or limited to such extent or in such manner as
   necessary for such provisions to be valid and enforceable to the greatest
   extent possible.


   12.     DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES

       12.1  Franchisor will use its reasonable efforts to furnish Developer
   with advice and assistance in developing Restaurants and in selecting
   sites therefor.

       12.2  Developer shall designate an individual employee who shall be
   personally responsible for Developer's activities during the term of this
   Agreement, and who shall devote his or her full-time, best efforts and
   constant personal attention, on a day-to-day basis, to Developer's
   activities in the Territory (the "Director of Operations").  Developer
   shall require that the Director of Operations maintain his or her
   principal personal residence in the Territory.  Franchisor reserves the
   right to require that, as a condition of his or her employment, the
   Director of Operations, as well as each supervisory employee referred to
   in Subsection 12.3, must successfully complete Franchisor's interview
   process and a psychological profile test in a manner which satisfies a
   uniform standard established by Franchisor.  The test shall be
   administered by Franchisor, or by a testing agency designated by
   Franchisor, at Developer's expense.  Developer's designation of the first
   Director of Operations, and any subsequent Director of Operations, shall
   be subject to the written approval of Franchisor, which approval shall not
   be arbitrarily withheld, and shall also be subject to the time limitations
   described in Subsection 9.2(e) hereof.  Franchisor shall notify Developer
   in writing within fourteen (14) business days of receipt of Developer's
   request whether Franchisor disapproves such person.  Failure by Franchisor
   to so notify Developer within that period shall be deemed to constitute
   Franchisor's approval of such person.

       12.3  In the event that Developer desires to designate an employee (in
   addition to the Director of Operations) who will have supervisory
   authority over the development of operation of more than one (1)
   Restaurant within the Territory, Developer's designation of such a
   supervisory employee shall be subject to the written approval of
   Franchisor, which approval shall not be arbitrarily withheld.  Franchisor
   shall notify Developer in writing within fourteen (14) business days of
   receipt of Developer's request whether Franchisor disapproves such person. 
   Failure by Franchisor to so notify Developer within that period shall be
   deemed to constitute Franchisor's approval of such person.  Developer
   shall require that any such supervisory employee maintain his or her
   principal personal residence in the Territory.

       12.4  Developer shall require the Director of Operations to execute a
   confidentiality agreement and covenant not to compete in the form attached
   hereto as Appendix E.  In addition, at Franchisor's request, Developer
   shall obtain from the Director of Operations an agreement verifying his or
   her employment status.  Developer shall require that each other employee
   of Developer who will have supervisory authority over the development or
   operation of more than one (1) Restaurant execute a confidentiality
   agreement in the form attached hereto as Appendix F.  Developer shall be
   responsible for compliance of its employees with the agreements identified
   in this Subsection.

       12.5  (a)  Developer shall require its Director of Operations and any
   other supervisory employee designated pursuant to Subsection 12.3 to
   attend, and to successfully complete to Franchisor's reasonable
   satisfaction, an operations training course provided by Franchisor.  If
   the Director of Operations or any such supervisory employee fails to
   successfully complete Franchisor's operations training course, Franchisor
   may require designation of a new Director of Operations or replacement
   supervisory employee, as the case may be, and Developer shall designate a
   new Director of Operations or replacement supervisory employee who shall
   be required to successfully complete such training course.

            (b)   The Director of Operations and supervisory employees
   designated pursuant to Subsection 12.3 shall, from time to time as
   reasonably requested by Franchisor, attend and successfully complete to
   Franchisor's reasonable satisfaction a Franchisor-provided refresher
   course in restaurant operations.

       12.6  With respect to each Restaurant within the Territory developed
   by Developer, Developer's employees must satisfy the training requirements
   described in Section 6 of Appendix B hereto.  After Developer opens it
   first Restaurant pursuant to this Agreement, Franchisor may at its option,
   and subject to such conditions as Franchisor deems necessary, permit
   Developer (at Developer's own expense) to conduct a portion of the
   required training at one of Developer's existing Restaurants.  In that
   event, Developer will be required to provide qualified personnel to
   administer training tests and to maintain records relating to the training
   and performance of employees.


   13.     NO WAIVER OF DEFAULT

       13.1  The waiver by any party to this Agreement of any breach or
   default, or series of breaches or defaults, of any term, covenant or
   condition herein, or of any same or similar term, covenant or condition
   contained in any other agreement between Franchisor and any other person,
   shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent or continuing breach or
   default of the same or any other term, covenant or condition in this
   Agreement, or in any other agreement between Franchisor and any other
   person.

       13.2  All rights and remedies of Franchisor shall be cumulative and
   not alternative, in addition to and not exclusive of any other rights or
   remedies which are provided for herein or which may be available at law or
   in equity in case of any breach, failure or default or threatened breach,
   failure or default of any term, provision or condition of this Agreement. 
   Franchisor's rights and remedies shall be continuing and shall not be
   exhausted by any one (1) or more uses thereof, and may be exercised at any
   time or from time to time as often as may be expedient; and any option or
   election to enforce any such right or remedy may be exercised or taken at
   any time and from time to time.  The expiration or earlier termination of
   this Agreement shall not discharge or release Developer or any Principal
   Shareholder from any liability or obligation then accrued, or any
   liability or obligation continuing beyond, or arising out of, the
   expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.


   14.     FORCE MAJEURE

       14.1  As used in this Agreement, the term "Force Majeure" shall mean
   any act of God, strike, lock-out or other industrial disturbance, war
   (declared or undeclared), riot, epidemic, fire or other catastrophe, act
   of any government and any other similar cause not within the control of
   the party affected thereby.

       14.2  If the performance of any obligation by any party under this
   Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of Force Majeure,
   which cannot be overcome by use of normal commercial measures, the parties
   shall be relieved of their respective obligations to the extent the
   parties are respectively necessarily prevented, hindered or delayed in
   such performance during the period of such Force Majeure.  The party whose
   performance is affected by an event of Force Majeure shall give prompt
   notice of such Force Majeure event to the other party by telephone or
   telegram (in each case to be confirmed in writing), setting forth the
   nature thereof and an estimate as to its duration, and shall be liable for
   failure to give such timely notice only to the extent of damage actually
   caused.


   15.     CONSTRUCTION, SEVERABILITY, GOVERNING LAW AND
       JURISDICTION

       15.1  If any part of this Agreement shall for any reason be declared
   invalid, unenforceable or impaired in any way, the validity of the
   remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect as if this
   Agreement had been executed with such invalid portion eliminated, and it
   is hereby declared the intention of the parties that they would have
   executed the remaining portion of this Agreement without including therein
   any such portions which might be declared invalid; provided however, that
   in the event any part hereof relating to the payment of fees to
   Franchisor, or the preservation of any of Franchisor's trade names,
   service marks, trademarks, trade secrets or secret formulae licensed or
   disclosed hereunder or pursuant to any franchise agreement between
   Franchisor and Developer is for any reason declared invalid or
   unenforceable, then Franchisor shall have the option of terminating this
   Agreement upon written notice to Developer.  If any clause or provision
   herein would be deemed invalid or unenforceable as written, it shall be
   deemed to be modified or limited to such extent or in such manner as may
   be necessary to render the clause or provision valid and enforceable to
   the greatest extent possible in light of the interest of the parties
   expressed in that clause or provision, subject to the provisions of the
   preceding sentence.

       15.2  DEVELOPER AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FRANCHISOR
   MAY ENTER INTO OTHER DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES
   ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND
   THAT IT IS OF MUTUAL BENEFIT TO DEVELOPER AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS AND
   TO FRANCHISOR THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BE UNIFORMLY INTERPRETED. 
   THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAW OF THE STATE
   OF MISSOURI DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH LOCAL FRANCHISE STATUTES, RULES AND
   REGULATIONS, MISSOURI LAW SHALL APPLY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS
   AGREEMENT AND SHALL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS WHICH ARISE WITH REFERENCE
   HERETO; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT PROVISIONS OF MISSOURI LAW REGARDING
   CONFLICTS OF LAW SHALL NOT APPLY HERETO.

       15.3  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING
   OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF WHICH
   CANNOT BE AMICABLY SETTLED, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, MAY, AT
   THE OPTION OF THE CLAIMANT, BE RESOLVED BY A PROCEEDING IN A COURT IN
   JACKSON COUNTY, MISSOURI, AND DEVELOPER AND THE PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS
   EACH IRREVOCABLY ACCEPT THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF
   MISSOURI AND THE FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN JACKSON COUNTY, MISSOURI FOR
   SUCH CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES.

       The parties agree that service of process in any proceeding arising
   out of or relating to this Agreement or the performance thereof may be
   made as to Developer and any Principal Shareholder by serving a person of
   suitable age and discretion (such as the person in charge of the office)
   at the address of Developer specified in this Agreement and as to
   Franchisor by serving the president or a vice-president of Franchisor at
   the address of Franchisor or by serving Franchisor's registered agent.

                               FRANCHISE AGREEMENT

   This Agreement is made this ________ day of _____________________,
   19______, by and between APPLEBEE'S INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Delaware
   corporation ("FRANCHISOR"), _____________________________________________,
   a (_______________ corporation, sole proprietorship, _______________
   partnership, _______________ limited partnership [strike inappropriate
   language]) ("FRANCHISEE") and ______________________________________
   ______________________________ (collectively, the "PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS"
   and, individually, a "PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER" of Franchisee if a
   corporation or general partner if Franchisee is a limited partnership
   having as its general partner a corporation) and
   __________________________________________________________________________
   _______
   ("GENERAL PARTNER" of Franchisee if Franchisee is a limited partnership).*

       *   (If Franchisee is not a corporation or a sole proprietorship, the
   parties hereto hereby agree that an Addendum shall be attached to this
   Agreement so as properly to reflect the responsibilities of the partners
   of any general partnership, the general partner of any limited partnership
   and the shareholders of any corporate general partner of any partnership.)


   WITNESSETH:

                                    RECITALS

       A.  Franchisor has acquired rights to develop and operate a unique
   system of restaurants which specialize in the sale of high quality,
   moderately priced food and alcoholic beverages in an attractive, casual
   setting, which includes proprietary rights in certain valuable trade
   names, service marks and trademarks, including the service mark Applebee's
   Neighborhood Grill & Bar and variations of such mark, designs, decor and
   color schemes for restaurant premises, signs, equipment, procedures and
   formulae for preparing food and beverage products, specifications for
   certain food and beverage products, inventory methods, operating methods,
   financial control concepts, a training facility and teaching
   techniques ("the System").

       B.  Franchisor has determined to establish, through its own
   development and operation, and through the granting of franchises, a chain
   of Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar restaurants which are distinctive;
   which are similar in appearance, design and decor; and which are uniform
   in operation and product consistency.

       C.  The value of Franchisor's trade names, service marks and
   trademarks is based upon:  (1) the maintenance of uniform high quality
   standards in connection with the preparation and sale of
   Franchisor-approved food and beverage products, (2) the uniform high
   standards of appearance of the individual restaurant units in the System,
   (3) the use of distinctive trademarks, service marks, building designs and
   advertising signs representing a uniformly high quality of product and
   services, and (4) the assumption by Franchisor and its franchisees of the
   obligation to maintain and enhance the goodwill and public acceptance of
   the System (and of Franchisor's trade names, service marks and trademarks)
   by strict adherence to the high standards required by Franchisor.

       D.  Franchisor, Franchisee and the Principal Shareholders have entered
   into a Development Agreement dated __________________, 19______
   ("Development Agreement"), relating to the development by Franchisee of
   Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar restaurants.

       E.  Franchisee desires to use the System in connection with the
   operation of an Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar restaurant at the
   location which is specified in Subsection 1.1 of this Agreement, pursuant
   to the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth.

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual obligations contained
   herein, it is hereby agreed as follows:


   1.  FRANCHISE GRANT AND TERM

       1.1    Franchisor grants Franchisee, for the term stated below, the
   right, license and privilege:

            (a)   to use the System incident to the operation of an
       Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar restaurant at
       _____________________________________________________ (the
       "Restaurant");

            (b)   to use the trade names, service marks and trademarks which
       Franchisor shall from time to time designate as part of the System,
       but only in connection with the sale at the Restaurant of those
       products which Franchisor has designated and approved; and

            (c)   to hold itself out to the public as a Franchisee of
       Franchisor.

       1.2    The term of the franchise shall commence as of the
   Commencement Date, as hereinafter defined, and shall end twenty (20) years
   thereafter, unless this Agreement is terminated prior to that date in
   accordance with its provisions.  "Commencement Date," as used herein,
   shall mean the date upon which the Restaurant opens for business.  The
   parties agree to affix to this Agreement an addendum expressly setting
   forth the Commencement Date, which, when so affixed, shall become a part
   of this Agreement.

       1.3    At the expiration of the term hereof, Franchisee shall have an
   option to operate the Restaurant for four (4) successive terms of five (5)
   years (unless the franchise agreement with respect to that additional term
   is sooner terminated in accordance with its provisions), provided that
   immediately prior to each such five (5) year term (a) Franchisee satisfies
   the requirements which Franchisor then-imposes on its new franchisees,
   (b) all other restaurant units within the System which Franchisee then-
   operates substantially comply, in the opinion of Franchisor, with
   Franchisor's then-current standards, specifications, requirements and
   instructions, and (c) Franchisee executes the form of franchise agreement
   which Franchisor is then using with respect to new restaurants within the
   System, with the amount of royalty and advertising fees payable at the
   rates then-prevailing under the franchise agreements which Franchisor is
   then using for new restaurants within the System, and Franchisee pays to
   Franchisor for each of said five (5) year periods a franchise fee equal to
   ten percent (10%) of the prevailing franchise fee paid by new franchisees
   at that time.  Any franchise agreement which Franchisee executes for such
   additional term will also contain options to obtain an assignment of
   Franchisee's lease with a third party and/or to purchase certain property
   or to purchase or lease the Restaurant premises exercisable by Franchisor
   upon termination thereof and an option to purchase or lease the Restaurant
   premises exercisable by Franchisor upon expiration of the renewal term
   (subject to any then-existing renewal rights of Franchisee).  Such options
   will contain provisions substantially similar to the provisions of
   Franchisor's options described in Subsection 19.4 hereof.  Franchisee
   shall give Franchisor written notice of its desire to exercise its option
   to operate the Restaurant for an additional term no earlier than
   twelve (12) months, and no later than seven (7) months, prior to
   expiration of the initial term.  If Franchisee gives that notice,
   Franchisor, in its sole discretion, reasonably exercised, shall determine
   whether Franchisee has satisfied the foregoing requirements.  Within
   forty-five (45) days of receiving the notice described above, Franchisor
   shall notify Franchisee in writing whether or not Franchisee is eligible
   to exercise the option described in this Subsection.

       1.4    During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
   expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Franchisor shall not
   establish a restaurant unit utilizing the System, or license another
   franchisee to establish a restaurant unit utilizing the System, at any
   location within the lesser of a three (3) mile radius of the Restaurant or
   a radius from the Restaurant which includes either a daytime or
   residential population of forty thousand (40,000) or more people.

       1.5    Franchisee, in consideration of the benefits and privileges
   provided to it by this Agreement, agrees to operate the Restaurant and
   perform as required hereunder for the full term of this Agreement.

       1.6    This Agreement is entered into pursuant to and subject to the
   terms and conditions which are set forth in the Development Agreement.


   2.  UNIFORM STANDARDS

       2.1    The System is a comprehensive restaurant system for the
   retailing of certain uniform and quality food and beverage products
   (including alcoholic beverages), emphasizing a varied menu of high
   quality, moderately priced food products (including appetizers, creative
   sandwiches, dinner entrees and desserts), a selection of alcoholic and
   other beverages, and prompt and courteous service in a clean, wholesome,
   casual atmosphere.  The foundation of the System is the establishment and
   maintenance of a reputation among the public for the operation of high
   quality restaurant units.  A fundamental requirement of the System, this
   Franchise Agreement and franchises which Franchisor will grant to others
   is adherence by all franchisees to Franchisor's standards and policies
   providing for the uniform operation of all restaurant units within the
   System, including, but not limited to, (a) selling only those products
   which Franchisor has designated and approved, (b) using only Franchisor's
   prescribed building layout and designs, equipment, signs, interior and
   exterior decor items, fixtures and furnishings, (c) adhering strictly to
   Franchisor's standards and specifications relating to the selection,
   purchase, storage, preparation, packaging, service and sale of all food
   and beverage products being sold at the Restaurant, and (d) satisfying all
   of Franchisor's prescribed standards of quality, service and cleanliness.
   Compliance by all franchisees with the foregoing standards and policies in
   conjunction with the use of Franchisor's trade names, service marks and
   trademarks provides the basis for the wide public acceptance of the System
   and its valuable goodwill.  Accordingly, strict adherence by all
   franchisees to all aspects of the System is required at all times.

       2.2    The provisions of the Agreement shall be interpreted to give
   effect to the intent of the parties stated in this Section 2 to assure
   that Franchisee shall operate the Restaurant in conformity with the
   System, through strict adherence to Franchisor's standards and policies as
   they now exist and as they may be modified from time to time.


   3.  COMPLIANCE WITH THE SYSTEM

       Franchisee acknowledges that every component of the System is
   important to Franchisor, to all franchisees and to the operation of the
   Restaurant, including the requirements (a) that only those products
   designated and approved by the Franchisor are sold at the Restaurant, and
   (b) that there is uniformity of food and beverage specifications,
   preparation methods, quality, appearance, building and interior design,
   color and decor, landscaping, facilities and service among all restaurant
   units in the System.  Accordingly, Franchisee agrees to and shall comply
   with all aspects of the System (as it now exists and as it may be modified
   from time to time).  Franchisee recognizes and agrees that Franchisor may
   prohibit the use of the System and its trade names, notwithstanding the
   granting of this Agreement, if Franchisee fails to design, construct,
   equip or furnish its Restaurant in compliance with the specifications
   designated by Franchisor, unless prior written approval has been received
   from Franchisor.


   4.  GENERAL SERVICES OF FRANCHISOR

       4.1    Franchisor shall advise and consult with Franchisee
   periodically in connection with the operation of the Restaurant, and at
   other reasonable times upon Franchisee's request.  Franchisor will provide
   to Franchisee such of its know-how, new developments, techniques and
   improvements in areas of restaurant design, management, food and beverage
   preparation, sales promotion and service concepts as may be pertinent to
   the construction and operation of the Restaurant under the System. 
   Franchisor may provide the foregoing information (a) by sending
   representatives to visit the Restaurant, (b) by providing written or other
   material, (c) at meetings or seminars, and (d) at training sessions at
   Franchisor's training facility and/or such other locations as may be
   selected by Franchisor from time to time.  Franchisor also shall make
   available to Franchisee all additional services, facilities, rights and
   privileges which Franchisor makes available from time to time to its
   franchisees of the System generally.

       4.2    For approximately eight (8) days prior to the opening of the
   Restaurant and the first six (6) days that the Restaurant is open for
   business, Franchisor shall provide Franchisee, at Franchisor's expense,
   with the services of up to a maximum of six (6) of Franchisor's training
   personnel to facilitate proper operation of the kitchen, bar and dining
   room areas during that period and to assist in correcting any operational
   problems which may arise.

       4.3    From time to time during the term of this Agreement,
   Franchisor will develop and test new menu items.  The menu consists of
   approved national food and beverage selections.  Franchisee shall comply
   with all menu changes which generally occur every six (6) months.  The
   menu may be modified to reflect food and beverage items peculiar to
   Franchisee's local area, subject to Franchisor's testing and approval.


   5.  RESTAURANT SYSTEM AND PROCEDURES

       5.1    Franchisor shall furnish Franchisee with advice and assistance
   in managing and operating the Restaurant, and Franchisor's representatives
   will visit the Restaurant periodically.  Franchisor will assist Franchisee
   in coordinating the Restaurant's pre-opening activities, and as noted more
   particularly in Subsection 4.2 hereof, shall provide Franchisee with the
   services of certain of Franchisor's personnel to facilitate proper
   operation of the Restaurant when it opens for business.

       5.2    Franchisee shall designate an employee who will supervise the
   Restaurant, and devote his or her full time, best efforts and constant
   personal attention to the day-to-day operation of the Restaurant (the
   "General Manager").  Franchisee also shall designate an employee who will
   supervise the Restaurant kitchen, and devote his or her full time, best
   efforts and constant personal attention to the day-to-day operation of the
   Restaurant kitchen (the "Kitchen Manager").

       5.3    Franchisee shall require that the General Manager, the Kitchen
   Manager and each of Franchisee's employees who serve as Restaurant
   managers to maintain his or her principal personal residence within a
   usual driving time of not more than approximately one (1) hour from the
   Restaurant.  Franchisor reserves the right to require that, as a condition
   of his or her employment, the General Manager must successfully complete
   Franchisor's interview process and a psychological profile test in a
   manner which satisfies a uniform standard established by Franchisor.  The
   test shall be administered by Franchisor, or by a testing agency
   designated by Franchisor, at Franchisee's expense.

       5.4    Unless Franchisor shall have given its prior written approval,
   Franchisee shall keep the Restaurant open for business only during the
   hours which are specified by Franchisor in the Franchise Operations Manual
   or in such other materials or manuals provided or made available by
   Franchisor to Franchisee (collectively the "Manuals"), provided that such
   hours do not conflict with state laws or local ordinances relating to the
   sale of alcoholic beverages or governing the hours during which restaurant
   establishments may be open for business.  In addition, Franchisee
   expressly agrees to:

            (a)   operate the Restaurant in a clean, safe and orderly manner,
       providing courteous, first-class service to the public;

            (b)   diligently promote and make every reasonable effort to
       increase the business of the Restaurant;

            (c)   advertise the business of the Restaurant by the use of the
       Franchisor's trade names, service marks and trademarks and such other
       insignia, slogans, emblems, symbols, designs and other identifying
       characteristics as may be developed or established from time to time
       by Franchisor and included in the Manuals, subject to the limitations
       of Subsections 8.4 and 8.5 hereof;

            (d)   prohibit and, to the best of Franchisee's ability, prevent
       the use of the Restaurant for any immoral or illegal purpose, or for
       any other purpose, business activity, use of function which is not
       expressly authorized hereunder or in the Manuals; and

            (e)   comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations,
       including, but not limited to, those relating to building
       construction, maintenance and safety, fire prevention, food safety,
       and the sale of alcoholic beverages.

       5.5    Franchisee hereby acknowledges receipt and loan of a copy of
   the Manuals heretofore or hereinafter furnished to Franchisee, and agrees
   to faithfully, completely and continuously perform, fulfill, observe and
   follow all instructions, requirements, standards, specifications, systems
   and procedures contained therein, including (a) those relating to the
   construction, design, decor, building and equipping of the Restaurant,
   (b) those relating to the selection, purchase, storage, preparation,
   packaging, service and sale of all products being sold at the Restaurant,
   (c) those relating to the maintenance and repair of Restaurant building,
   grounds, equipment, signs, interior and exterior decor items, fixtures and
   furnishings, and (d) those relating to employee uniforms and dress,
   accounting, bookkeeping, record retention, and other business systems,
   procedures and operations.  The Manuals are incorporated herein by
   reference and hereby made part of this Agreement.  Franchisee acknowledges
   and agrees that the materials contained in the Manuals are integral,
   necessary and material elements of the System.

       5.6    Franchisee understands, acknowledges and agrees that strict
   conformity with the System, including the standards, specifications,
   systems, procedures, requirements and instructions contained in this
   Agreement and in the Manuals, is vitally important, not only to the
   success of Franchisor, but to the collective success of all of
   Franchisor's other franchisees, by reason of the benefits which Franchisor
   and all of its franchisees will derive from uniformity in products sold,
   identity, quality, appearance, facilities and service among all restaurant
   units which are part of the System.  Without limiting the generality of
   the foregoing provisions, Franchisee agrees to adhere strictly to the
   requirements in the Manuals relating (a) to the construction, design,
   decor, building and equipping of the Restaurant, (b) to the maximum
   permissible ratio of sales of alcoholic beverages to sales of food at the
   Restaurant, and (c) to the limitations on the number of video games or
   similar devices which may be placed on the Restaurant premises.  Any
   failure to adhere to the standards, specifications, systems, requirements
   or instructions contained in this Agreement or in the Manuals shall
   constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

       5.7    Franchisor shall have the right, at any time and from time to
   time, in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment,
   consistent with the overall best interests of the System generally, having
   due regard for the financial burden which may be placed upon its
   franchisees, to revise, amend, delete from and add to the System and the
   material contained in the Manuals.  Franchisee expressly agrees to comply
   with all such revisions, amendments, deletions and additions.

       5.8    Franchisee shall offer for sale from the Restaurant, at all
   times when the Restaurant is open for business, only the products which
   are expressly designated in the Manuals, except, as noted more
   particularly in Subsection 4.3, to the extent that Franchisee has obtained
   Franchisor's prior written consent to a modification of that requirement. 
   No product shall be offered or sold at or from the Restaurant under, or in
   connection with, any trademark or service mark other than Franchisor's
   designated trademarks and service marks without Franchisor's prior written
   consent.

       5.9    Franchisee shall obtain all food and beverage products,
   equipments, signs, interior and exterior decor items, fixtures,
   furnishings, supplies, and other products and materials required for the
   operation of or sold at the Restaurant solely from suppliers (including
   manufacturers, distributors and other sources) who demonstrate, to
   Franchisor's continuing reasonable satisfaction, the ability to meet
   Franchisor's then-current standards and specifications for such items; who
   possess adequate quality controls and capacity to supply Franchisee's
   needs promptly and reliably; and who have been approved in writing by
   Franchisor and not thereafter disapproved.  The Manuals contain a list of
   approved suppliers.  If Franchisee desires to purchase any items from an
   unapproved supplier, Franchisee shall submit to Franchisor a written
   request for such approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
   withheld, or shall request the supplier itself to do so.  Franchisor shall
   have the right to inspect the supplier's facilities, and to require that
   samples from the supplier be delivered, at Franchisor's option, either to
   Franchisor or to an independent, certified laboratory designated by
   Franchisor for testing.  Franchisee or the supplier shall pay the costs of
   any such test.  Franchisor shall notify Franchisee in writing within
   forty-five (45) days of receiving any such request whether it disapproves
   the supplier.  Failure by Franchisor to so notify Franchisee within that
   period shall be deemed to constitute Franchisor's approval of such
   supplier.  Franchisor reserves the right, at its option, to reinspect the
   facilities and retest products of any such approved supplier at any time
   and to revoke its approval upon the supplier's failure to continue to meet
   any of Franchisor's criteria.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any supplier
   of goods having any trademark, trade name, service mark, logo or symbol
   owned by Franchisor shall not be approved to supply Franchisee such goods
   until such supplier has entered a written agreement with Franchisor
   regarding the production, use and sale of such goods.

       5.10  No food or beverage product, interior or exterior decor item,
   sign, item of equipment, fixtures, furnishings or supplies, or other
   product or material required for the operation of the Restaurant, which
   bears any of Franchisor's trade names, service marks or trademarks, shall
   be used or sold in or upon the Restaurant premises unless the same shall
   have been first submitted to and approved in writing by Franchisor.

       5.11  The Manuals and all related material furnished to Franchisee
   hereunder are and shall remain the property of Franchisor, and must be
   returned to Franchisor, along with any copies made thereof, immediately
   upon request or upon the expiration or earlier termination of this
   Agreement.


   6.  TRAINING

       6.1    Franchisor shall make its operations training course available
   to the General Manager, the Kitchen Manager, and Franchisee's Assistant
   Managers and other Restaurant managers.

       6.2    Before the Restaurant opens for business, and thereafter as
   replacement personnel are employed by Franchisee, the General Manager, the
   Kitchen Manager and each Assistant Manager shall attend Franchisor's
   operations training facility for such period of time as Franchisor shall
   deem reasonably necessary, and shall successfully complete that course to
   Franchisor's reasonable satisfaction.  If the General Manager, Kitchen
   Manager or an Assistant Manager fails to successfully complete
   Franchisor's operations training course, Franchisor may require
   designation of a new General Manager, Kitchen Manager or Assistant
   Manager, as the case may be, and Franchisee shall designate a new General
   Manager, Kitchen Manager or Assistant Manager, who shall be required to
   successfully complete such training course.

       6.3    The General Manager, the Kitchen Manager and each Assistant
   Manager shall, from time to time as reasonably required by Franchisor,
   attend and successfully complete to Franchisor's reasonable satisfaction a
   Franchisor-provided refresher course in restaurant operations.

       6.4    Franchisee shall be responsible for the Restaurant's
   compliance with the operating standards, methods, techniques and material
   taught at Franchisor's operations training course, and shall cause the
   employees of the Restaurant to be trained in such standards, methods and
   techniques as are relevant to the performance of their respective duties.

       6.5    Attendance of the General Manager, the Kitchen Manager and
   each Assistant Manager at any of Franchisor's training courses shall be
   tuition-free.  Franchisee shall pay all other costs and expenses relating
   to the attendance of Franchisee's personnel at any of Franchisor's
   training courses, including, without limitation, the cost of travel,
   lodging, meals, and other related and incidental expenses.


   7.  RESTAURANT MAINTENANCE

       7.1    Franchisee shall, at Franchisee's sole cost and expense,
   maintain the Restaurant in conformity with the standards, specifications
   and requirements of the System, as the same may be designated by
   Franchisor from time to time.  Franchisee specifically agrees to repair or
   replace, at Franchisee's cost and expense, equipment, signs, interior and
   exterior decor items, fixtures, furnishings, supplies, and other products
   and materials required for the operation of the Restaurant as necessary or
   desirable, and to obtain, at Franchisee's cost and expense, any new or
   additional equipment, signs, interior and exterior decor items, fixtures,
   furnishings, supplies, and other products and materials which may be
   reasonably required by Franchisor for new products or procedures.  Except
   as may be expressly provided in the Manuals, no alterations or
   improvements, or changes of any kind in design, equipment, signs, interior
   or exterior decor items, fixtures or furnishings shall be made in or about
   the Restaurant or Restaurant premises without the prior written approval
   of Franchisor in each instance.

       7.2    In order to assure the continued success of the Restaurant,
   Franchisee shall, at any time from time to time after ________________,
   _________, (i.e., six [6] years after the date of this Agreement) as
   reasonably required by Franchisor (taking into consideration the cost and
   then-remaining term of this Agreement), modernize the Restaurant premises,
   equipment, signs, interior and exterior decor items, fixtures,
   furnishings, supplies, and other products and materials required for the
   operation of the Restaurant, to Franchisor's then-current standards and
   specifications, provided that at the time Franchisor requires Franchisee
   to so modernize the Restaurant premises at least twenty-five percent (25%)
   of Franchisor-owned and operated Restaurants meet such standards and
   specifications.  Franchisee's obligations under this Subsection are in
   addition to, and shall not relieve Franchisee from, any of its other
   obligations under this Agreement, including those contained in the
   Manuals.

       7.3    If Franchisee is or becomes a lessee of the Restaurant
   premises, Franchisee shall have included in the lease provisions expressly
   permitting both Franchisee and Franchisor to take all actions and make all
   alterations referred to under Subsections 7.1 and 7.2 hereof, requiring
   the lessor thereunder to give Franchisor reasonable notice of any
   contemplated termination, and providing that Franchisee has the
   unrestricted right to assign the lease to Franchisor without the lessor
   having any right to impose conditions on such assignment or to obtain any
   payment in connection therewith.  Franchisee shall not, without the prior
   written consent of Franchisor, execute any lease or other agreement which
   imposes, or purports to impose, any limitations on the ability of
   Franchisee and/or of Franchisor to operate additional restaurants at any
   particular location beyond the geographic limitation set forth in Section
   1.4 hereof, or any lease the term of which is shorter than the term of
   this Agreement.


   8.  ADVERTISING

       8.1    Franchisor shall develop and administer advertising, public
   relations and sales promotion programs designed to promote and enhance the
   collective success of all restaurant units in the System.  It is expressly
   understood, acknowledged and agreed that in all phases of such advertising
   and promotion, including, without limitation, type, quantity, timing,
   placement and choice of media and medium, market areas, advertising
   agencies and public relations firms, Franchisor's decisions shall be final
   and binding.  Franchisee shall have the right to participate actively in
   all such advertising, public relations and sales promotion programs, but
   only in full and complete accordance with such terms and conditions as may
   be established by Franchisor for each such program.

       8.2    Franchisee shall pay Franchisor, in the manner described in
   Section 9 hereof, a minimum dollar amount equal to one and one-half
   percent (1.5%) of Franchisee's gross sales, as defined in Subsection 9.3
   hereof.  Such funds shall become the sole and absolute property of
   Franchisor, to be allocated to a separate "advertising account"
   established by Franchisor.  Franchisor shall use such funds for market
   studies, advertising and marketing studies or services, production of
   commercials, advertising copy and layouts, traffic costs, agency fees,
   marketing personnel, or any other costs associated with the development,
   marketing and testing of advertising, and for the purchase of advertising
   time, space or materials in national, regional or other advertising media,
   in a manner determined by Franchisor in its sole discretion.  Within
   six (6) months following the end of Franchisor's fiscal year, Franchisor
   shall provide all franchisees with an accounting of all amounts received
   from them and expended by Franchisor for the matters set forth above.  In
   addition, Franchisee shall expend a minimum dollar amount equal to one and
   one-half percent (1.5%) of Franchisee's gross sales, for local promotional
   activities, subject to the provisions of Subsections 8.4 and 8.5 hereof. 
   Franchisor shall have the right at all times to review Franchisee's books
   and records, and to require Franchisee to produce evidence of its gross
   sales and local promotional activities, to ensure Franchisee's compliance
   with this Section.  Any amount determined by said audit to be due
   Franchisor as part of the advertising fee will be paid to Franchisor by
   Franchisee within ten (10) days thereafter.  At any time after execution
   of this Agreement, Franchisor may in its sole discretion increase, to a
   maximum of four percent (4%) of gross sales, the percentage of gross sales
   which Franchisee shall be required to pay to Franchisor for allocation to
   a separate advertising account pursuant to this Subsection 8.2. 
   Franchisor shall use the funds paid pursuant to that increased percentage
   requirement solely for the purchase of advertising time, space or
   materials in national, regional or other advertising media, in a manner
   determined by Franchisor in its sole discretion, provided that in each
   calendar year (or other twelve [12] month period established by
   Franchisor) in which Franchisor makes expenditures for advertising from
   such an advertising account, so long as Franchisee is in compliance with
   its obligations hereunder, Franchisor's expenditures for advertising in
   the Territory encompassed by the Development Agreement (including
   expenditures for national or regional advertising in media which reach
   that Territory) shall be on a basis which is roughly proportional to
   Franchisee's contribution to that advertising account during that calendar
   year or other twelve (12) month period.  Franchisor also may increase the
   percentage of gross sales which Franchisee shall be required to spend for
   local promotional activities, provided however, that in no event shall
   Franchisee be required to make payments pursuant to this Subsection 8.2 in
   a dollar amount in excess of five percent (5%) of gross sales.

       8.3    Franchisee shall submit to Franchisor, for Franchisor's
   approval, an advertising campaign plan relating to the promotion of the
   opening of the Restaurant which is sufficient to meet the needs of the
   market.  The Manuals contain a Press Release kit to assist Franchisee in
   this regard.  Franchisee shall conduct the approved advertising campaign
   and make all expenditures for advertising to promote the opening of the
   Restaurant no later than sixty (60) days after the Restaurant opens for
   business.  Franchisor will reimburse fifty percent (50%) of Franchisee's
   out-of-pocket opening advertising expenditures up to a maximum of two
   thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), if Franchisee meets the following
   criteria:

            (a)   Franchisee's opening advertising expenditures are made
       within sixty (60) days after the opening of the Restaurant;

            (b)   Franchisee submits to Franchisor within one hundred
       twenty (120) days after the opening of the Restaurant documentation
       for the opening advertising expenditures, such as paid invoices from
       suppliers of goods or services evidencing expenditure on the opening
       advertising promotion; and

            (c)   Franchisee's opening advertising expenditures are made
       pursuant to the approved advertising campaign plan and in accordance
       with the Grand Opening Reimbursement Program Policy Guidelines set
       forth in the Manuals.

       8.4    Nothing in the foregoing Subsections shall be deemed to
   prohibit Franchisee from making additional expenditures for local
   promotional activities.  All of the Franchisee's local promotional
   activities shall utilize approved advertising media.  "Approved
   advertising media" are limited to the following:

            (a)   Newspapers, magazines and other such periodicals;

            (b)   Radio and television;

            (c)   Outdoor advertising by signs displayed on billboards or
       buildings; and

            (d)   Handbills, flyers, door-hangers and direct mail.

   In the event Franchisee wants to use a form of advertising medium not set
   forth above, Franchisee shall submit a description of such medium and
   advertising to Franchisor.  Franchisor shall notify Franchisee whether it
   approves the use of such medium within thirty (30) days of Franchisee's
   request.  Failure by Franchisor to so notify Franchisee within that period
   shall be deemed to constitute Franchisor's approval of such request. 
   Guidelines for local promotional activities are contained in the Manuals.

       8.5    All advertising copy and other materials employed by
   Franchisee in local promotional activities shall be in strict accordance
   and conformity with the standards, formats and specimens contained in the
   Manuals and shall receive the prior approval of Franchisor.  In the event
   Franchisee wishes to deviate from the materials contained in the Manuals,
   Franchisee shall submit, in each instance, the proposed advertising copy
   and materials to Franchisor for approval in advance of publication. 
   Franchisor shall notify Franchisee in writing, within fifteen (15) days of
   such submission, whether Franchisor disapproves such advertising copy and
   materials.  Failure by Franchisor to so notify Franchisee within that
   period shall be deemed to constitute Franchisor's approval of such
   advertising copy and materials.  In no event shall Franchisee's
   advertising contain any statement or material which may be considered
   (a) in bad taste or offensive to the public or to any group of persons,
   (b) defamatory of any person or an attack on any competitor, (c) to
   infringe upon the use, without permission, of any other persons' trade
   name, trademark, service mark or identification, or (d) inconsistent with
   the public image of Franchisor or of the System.

   9.  FEES

       9.1    As partial consideration for the rights granted hereunder,
   Franchisee shall pay Franchisor:

            (a)   an initial franchise fee of _____________________
       dollars ($__________), to be paid in the manner prescribed in
       Subsection 4.l of the Development Agreement as payment for the grant
       of the franchise;

            (b)   a monthly royalty fee as determined by Franchisor, not to
       exceed five percent (5%) of each calendar month's gross sales, as
       provided in Subsection 4.3 of the Development Agreement, as payment
       for Franchisee's continuing right to operate the Restaurant as part of
       the System (see Exhibit 1); and

            (c)   a monthly advertising fee equal to such percentage of each
       calendar month's gross sales as Franchisor may require pursuant to
       Subsection 8.2 hereof.

       Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the
   royalty fee set forth in Subsection 9.1(b) is equal to five percent (5%)
   of monthly gross sales, then in such an event, the advertising fee
   described in Subsection 9.1(c) shall not exceed four percent (4%) of
   monthly gross sales.

       9.2    The fees referred to in Subsections 9.l(b) and (c) (the
   "Fees") shall be paid by check mailed and postmarked on or before the
   twelfth day of the next full month immediately following the month to
   which the Fees relate.  Any Fees, including the initial franchise fee,
   which are not paid when due shall bear interest from and after the due
   dates thereof at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum or the
   highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.

       9.3     (a)    Except as provided in Subsection 9.3(b) hereof, the
   term "gross sales," as used in this Agreement, shall mean all receipts
   (cash, cash equivalents or credit) or revenues from sales from all
   business conducted upon or from the Restaurant premises, whether evidenced
   by check, cash, credit, charge account, exchange or otherwise, including,
   but not limited to, amounts received from the sale of goods, wares and
   merchandise (including sales of food, beverages and tangible property of
   every kind and nature, promotional or otherwise), from all services
   performed from or at the Restaurant premises, and from all orders taken or
   received at the Restaurant premises, regardless of where such orders are
   filled.  Gross sales shall not be reduced by any deductions for cash
   shortages incurred in connection with the transaction of business with
   customers, credit card company charges or theft which is reimbursed by
   insurance or is not reported to the appropriate police authorities.  Each
   charge or sale upon installment or credit shall be treated as a sale for
   the full price in the month during which such charge or sale shall be
   first made, irrespective of the time when Franchisee shall receive payment
   (whether full or partial) therefor.

            (b)   Gross sales shall not include:  (i) the sale of merchandise
   for which cash has been refunded or, except as provided in the second
   sentence of Subsection 9.3(a), not received, or allowances made for
   merchandise, if the sales of any such returned or exchanged merchandise
   shall have been previously included in gross sales, (ii) the amount of any
   sales tax imposed by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
   authority directly on sales and intended to be collected from customers,
   provided that the amount thereof is added to the selling price and
   actually paid by the Franchisee to such governmental authority, (iii) the
   sale of merchandise for which a gift certificate is redeemed, provided
   that the initial sale of said gift certificate shall have been previously
   included in gross sales, (iv) the sale of waste products of the
   Restaurant, (v) the sale of meals to employees, (vi) telephone, game and
   vending machine revenues, (vii) the sale of non-food items or beverages at
   a discount in connection with a promotional campaign, (viii) one-time sale
   of furniture, fixtures or equipment, and (ix) theft which is not covered
   by insurance and is reported to the appropriate police authorities.  In
   addition, Franchisor may, from time to time, in writing, permit or allow
   certain other items to be excluded from gross sales.  Any such permission
   or allowance may be revoked or withdrawn at Franchisor's discretion.


   10.     RECORD KEEPING

       10.1  Franchisor shall provide Franchisee with a choice of two (2) or
   more approved point of sales systems, and Franchisee shall employ one (1)
   of such approved systems, without modification, in connection with the
   business of the Restaurant.  Franchisee shall use such bookkeeping and
   record keeping forms as shall be prescribed in the Manuals.

       10.2  Franchisee shall complete and submit to Franchisor, on a
   regular, continuous basis, each of the following reports, in the form

       each calendar month following the month to which the report relates;

            (b)   annual Restaurant reports, on or before the fifteenth day
       of April of each year; and

            (c)   weekly gross sales reports, on or before the Tuesday
       following the calendar week to which the report relates.

       10.3  The annual Restaurant reports referred to above shall include a
   balance sheet dated as of the end of Franchisee's fiscal year or calendar
   year and a profit and loss statement for such year, together with such
   additional financial information as Franchisor may reasonably request. 
   Such balance sheet and profit and loss statement shall be prepared in
   accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certified as
   correct and complete by Franchisee's chief executive officer, president,
   chief financial officer or controller and reported on and reviewed by an
   independent state-licensed certified public accountant.  If Franchisee
   fails to provide Franchisor with such balance sheet and profit and loss
   statement, Franchisor shall have the right to have an independent audit
   made of Franchisee's books and records, and Franchisee shall promptly
   reimburse Franchisor for the cost thereof.

       10.4  Each of the reports referred to in this Section 10 shall be
   completed by Franchisee or its accountant in the respective specimen
   forms, and in accordance with the instructions, contained in the Manuals. 
   Subsection 10.3 notwithstanding, time is of the essence with respect to
   the completion and submission of each such report.

       11.3  In addition to the financial information which Franchisee is
   required to provide to Franchisor under Subsections 10.2 and 11.1 hereof,
   Franchisee and Principal Shareholders shall provide Franchisor with such

   financial statements of Franchisee and each Principal Shareholder, dated
   as of the end of the last preceding fiscal year of the Franchisee or
   Principal Shareholder, said statements to be delivered to Franchisor no
   later than April 15 of each year.

       11.4  Franchisee and each Principal Shareholder represent, warrant and
   covenant that all Interests (as defined in Subsection 12.4 hereto) in
   Franchisee are owned as set forth on Appendix A hereto, that no Interest

   obligated to Franchisor with respect to such financial obligation.  Each
   Principal Shareholder hereby expressly waives presentment, demand, notice
   of dishonor, protest, and all other notices whatsoever with respect to
   Franchisor's enforcement of this guaranty.  In addition, each Principal
   Shareholder agrees that if the performance or observance by Franchisee of
   any term or provision hereof is waived or the time of performance thereof
   extended by Franchisor, or payment of any such financial obligation is
   accelerated in accordance with any agreement between Franchisor and any
   party liable in respect thereto or extended or renewed, in whole or in
   part, all as Franchisor may determine, whether or not notice to or consent
   by any Principal Shareholder or any other party liable in respect to such
   financial obligations is given or obtained, such actions shall not affect
   or alter the guaranty of each Principal Shareholder described in this
   Subsection.


   12.     TRANSFER

       12.1  There shall be no Transfer of any Interest of Franchisee, or of
   a Principal Shareholder in Franchisee, in whole or in part (whether
   voluntarily or by operation of law), directly, indirectly or contingently,
   except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.  "Transfer"

       shares of stock or other equity interest in Franchisee which would
       result from the act of any shareholder of Franchisee ("Shareholder"),
       such as a sale, exchange, pledge or hypothecation of shares, or any
       interest in or rights to any of Franchisee's profits, revenues or
       assets, or any such change which would result by operation of law; and

            (b)   any change in the percentage interest owned by any
       Shareholder in the shares of stock of Franchisee, or interests in its
       profits, revenues or assets which would result from any act of
       Franchisee such as a sale, pledge or hypothecation of any Restaurant
       assets (other than a pledge of assets to secure bona fide loans made
       or credit extended in connection with acquisition of the assets
       pledged, provided that immediately before and after such transaction
       the net worth of Franchisee shall not be less than the amount which is
       reflected on the Balance Sheet referred to in Subsection 11.1 of this
       Agreement); any sale or issuance of any shares of Franchisee's stock;
       the retirement or redemption of any shares of Franchisee's stock; or
       any sale or grant to any person of any right to participate in or
       otherwise to share or become entitled to any part of Franchisee's
       profits, revenues, assets or equity.

       12.3  "Transfer" shall not include (a) a change in the ownership of or
   rights to any shares or other equity interest in Franchisee pursuant to a
   public offering of Franchisee's securities registered under the Securities
   Act of 1933, or (b) a change in the ownership of or rights to any
   securities or other equity interest in Franchisee pursuant to a private
   offering of Franchisee's securities exempted from registration under such
   Act, provided that Franchisee provides Franchisor with a copy of its S-1
   prospectus and/or offering memorandum ten (10) days prior to its filing
   with the Securities and Exchange Commission or circulation to third
   parties so that Franchisor may comment and, if necessary, correct any
   information concerning Franchisor and/or the System, and further provided
   that after giving effect to such public or private offering, the Principal
   Shareholders, or any of them, "control" Franchisee.  For purposes of this
   Section 12, "control" means either (1) holding fifty-one percent (51%) or
   more of the outstanding voting securities of Franchisee, or (2) having the
   contractual power presently to designate a majority of the directors of
   Franchisee.

       12.4  "Interest" shall mean:  when referring to interests or rights in
   Franchisee, any shares of Franchisee's stock and any other equitable or
   legal right in or to any of Franchisee's stock, revenues, profits or
   assets; when referring to rights or assets of Franchisee, Franchisee's
   rights under and interest in this Agreement, the Restaurant and its
   revenues, profits and assets.

       12.5  (a)  The Interest of a Principal Shareholder may be transferred
   to such Principal Shareholder's spouse or children or to a person
   designated in such Principal Shareholder's will or trust (individually and
   collectively referred to as a "Successor"), upon such Principal
   Shareholder's death or permanent incapacity, without Franchisor's
   approval, provided that such Successor shall agree to be bound by the
   restrictions contained in this Section 12, and the other agreements and
   covenants of the Principal Shareholders contained in this Agreement.

            (b)   The Interest of a Principal Shareholder may not be
   transferred to another Principal Shareholder without Franchisor's
   approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (c)   The Interest of a Successor may only be transferred in
   accordance with Subsection 12.5(b) or 12.6, regardless of whether such
   Transfer is for consideration or by gift or will or other device.

       12.6  (a)  Franchisee understands and acknowledges that the rights and
   duties set forth in this Agreement are personal to Franchisee and that
   Franchisor has entered into this Agreement in reliance on the business
   skill and financial capability of Franchisee, and the business skill,
   financial capability and personal character of each Principal Shareholder. 
   Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, the Principal
   Shareholders shall at all times retain control of Franchisee.  Except as
   otherwise provided in this Section 12, no Transfer of any part of
   Franchisee's Interest in this Agreement or in the Restaurant, and no
   Transfer of any Interest of any Principal Shareholder, shall be completed
   except in accordance with this Subsection 12.6.  In the event of such a
   proposed Transfer of any part of Franchisee's Interest in this Agreement
   or in the Restaurant, or of any Interest of any Principal Shareholder, the
   party or parties desiring to effect such Transfer shall give Franchisor
   notice in writing of the proposed Transfer, which notice shall set forth
   the name and address of the proposed transferee, its financial condition,
   including a copy of its financial statement dated not more than
   ninety (90) days prior to the date of said notice, and all the terms and
   conditions of the proposed Transfer.  Upon receiving such notice,
   Franchisor may (i) approve the Transfer, or (ii) withhold its consent to
   the Transfer.  Franchisor shall, within forty-five (45) days of receiving
   such notice and all of the information required therein, advise the party
   or parties desiring to effect the Transfer whether it (1) approves the
   Transfer, or (2) withholds its consent to the Transfer, giving the reasons
   for such disapproval.  Failure of Franchisor to so advise said party or
   parties within that forty-five (45) day period shall be deemed to be an
   approval of the proposed Transfer.  Appendix B sets forth the criteria for
   obtaining Franchisor's consent to a proposed Transfer.

            (b)   In the event that Franchisor approves the Transfer, and the
   Transfer is not completed within ninety (90) days of the later of
   (i) expiration of the forty-five (45) day notice period, or (ii) delivery
   of notice of Franchisor's approval of the proposed Transfer, Franchisor's
   approval of the proposed Transfer shall automatically be revoked.  The
   ninety (90) day limitation described in the preceding sentence shall not
   apply if at the end of said ninety (90) day period the only issue which
   prevents completion of the Transfer is the need to effect transfers of the
   applicable liquor licenses.  In the event of such a delay, the Transfer
   shall take place within seven (7) business days after those liquor
   licenses have been transferred.  Any subsequent proposal to complete the
   proposed Transfer shall be subject to Franchisor's right of approval as
   provided herein.  The party which desires to effect the proposed Transfer
   shall immediately notify Franchisor in writing of any change in the terms
   of a Transfer.  Any material change in the terms of a Transfer prior to
   closing shall cause it to be deemed a new Transfer, revoking any approval
   previously given by Franchisor and conferring upon Franchisor a new right
   to approve such Transfer, which shall be deemed to commence on the day on
   which Franchisor receives written notice of such changes in terms.

       12.7  In connection with any request for Franchisor's approval of a
   proposed Transfer pursuant to this Section 12, the parties to the proposed
   Transfer shall pay Franchisor a fee to defray the actual cost of review
   and the administrative and professional expenses related to the proposed
   Transfer and the preparation and execution of documents and agreements, up
   to a maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).


   13.     CONFIDENTIALITY; RESTRICTIONS

       13.1  Franchisee and its Principal Shareholders acknowledge that over
   the term of this Agreement they are to receive proprietary information
   which Franchisor has developed over time at great expense, including, but
   not limited to, information regarding the System, methods of site
   selection, marketing and public relations methods, product analysis and
   selection, and service methods and skills relating to the development and
   operation of Restaurants.  They further acknowledge that this information,
   which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, that contained in the
   Manuals, is not generally known in the industry and is beyond their own
   present skills and experience, and that to develop it themselves would be
   expensive, time consuming and difficult.  Franchisee and its Principal
   Shareholders further acknowledge that the Franchisor's information
   provides a competitive advantage and will be valuable to them in the
   development of their business, and that gaining access to it is therefore
   a primary reason why they are entering into this Agreement.  Accordingly,
   Franchisee and its Principal Shareholders agree that Franchisor's
   information, as described above, which may or may not be "trade secrets"
   under prevailing judicial interpretations, is private and valuable, and
   constitutes trade secrets belonging to Franchisor.  Accordingly, in
   consideration of Franchisor's confidential disclosure to them of these
   trade secrets, Franchisee and Principal Shareholders agree as follows
   (subject to the provisions of the Development Agreement and any other
   franchise agreement between Franchisor and Franchisee):

            (a)   During the term of this Agreement, neither Franchisee nor
       any Principal Shareholder, for so long as such Principal Shareholder
       owns an Interest in Franchisee, may, without the prior written consent
       of Franchisor, directly or indirectly engage in, or acquire any
       financial or beneficial interest (including any interest in
       corporations, partnerships, trusts, unincorporated associations or
       joint ventures) in, advise, help, guarantee loans or make loans to,
       any restaurant business whose menu or method of operation is similar
       to that employed by restaurant units within the System which is either
       (i) located in the Territory, as defined in the Development Agreement,
       (ii) located in the Area of Dominant Influence (as defined and
       established from time to time by Arbitron Ratings Company) of any
       Restaurant developed pursuant to the Development Agreement,
       (iii) located within a five (5) mile radius of any restaurant unit
       within the System, or (iv) determined by Franchisor, exercising
       reasonable good faith judgment, to be a direct competitor of the
       System.

            (b)   Neither Franchisee, for two (2) years following the
       termination of this Agreement, nor any Principal Shareholder, for
       two (2) years following the termination of all of his or her Interest
       in Franchisee or the termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs
       first, may directly or indirectly engage in, or acquire any financial
       or beneficial interest (including any interest in corporations,
       partnerships, trusts, unincorporated associations or joint ventures)
       in, advise, help, guarantee loans or make loans to, any restaurant
       business whose menu or method of operation is similar to that employed
       by restaurant units within the System which is located either (i) in
       the Territory, as defined in the Development Agreement, (ii) in the
       Area of Dominant Influence (as defined and established from time to
       time by Arbitron Ratings Company) of any restaurant developed pursuant
       to the Development Agreement, (iii) within a five (5) mile radius of
       any restaurant unit within the System, or (iv) within any area for
       which an active, currently binding development agreement has been
       granted by Franchisor to another franchisee as of the date of the
       termination.

            (c)   Neither Franchisee nor any Shareholder shall at any time
       (i) appropriate or use the trade secrets incorporated in the System,
       or any portion thereof, in any restaurant business which is not within
       the System, (ii) disclose or reveal any portion of the System to any
       person, other than to Franchisee's Restaurant employees as an incident
       of their training, (iii) acquire any right to use any name, mark or
       other intellectual property right which is or may be granted by this
       Agreement, except in connection with the operation of the Restaurant,
       or (iv) communicate, divulge or use for the benefit of any other
       person or entity any confidential information, knowledge or know-how
       concerning the methods of development or operation of a restaurant
       utilizing the System, which may be communicated by Franchisor in
       connection with the franchise granted hereunder.

       13.2  Franchisee and Principal Shareholders agree that the provisions
   of this Section 13 are and have been a primary inducement to Franchisor to
   enter into this Agreement, and that in the event of breach thereof
   Franchisor would be irreparably injured and would be without adequate
   remedy at law.  Therefore, in the event of a breach, or a threatened or
   attempted breach, of any of such provisions Franchisor shall be entitled,
   in addition to any other remedies which it may have hereunder or at law or
   in equity (including the right to terminate this Agreement), to a
   preliminary and/or permanent injunction and a decree for specific
   performance of the terms hereof without the necessity of showing actual or
   threatened damage, and without being required to furnish a bond or other
   security.

       13.3  The restrictions contained in Subsection 13.1(a) and (b) above
   shall not apply to ownership of less than two percent (2%) of the shares
   of a company whose shares are listed and traded on a national securities
   exchange if such shares are owned for investment only, and are not owned
   by an officer, director, employee, or consultant of such publicly traded
   company.

       13.4  If any court or other tribunal having jurisdiction to determine
   the validity or enforceability of this Section 13 determines that it would
   be invalid or unenforceable as written, then the provisions hereof shall
   be deemed to be modified or limited to such extent or in such manner as
   necessary for such provisions to be valid and enforceable to the greatest
   extent possible.

       13.5  Franchisee shall require the General Manager, the Kitchen
   Manager and each of its Restaurant managers to execute a confidentiality
   agreement in the form attached hereto as Appendix C.  Franchisee shall be
   responsible for compliance of its employees with the agreements identified
   in this Subsection.


   14.     INSPECTIONS

       14.1  Franchisor shall have the right at any time, and from time to
   time, to have its representatives enter the Restaurant premises without
   notice for the purpose of inspecting the condition thereof and the
   operation of the Restaurant in order to determine whether Franchisee is in
   compliance with the standards, specifications, requirements and
   instructions contained in this Agreement and in the Manuals, and for any
   other reasonable purpose connected with the operation of the Restaurant.

       14.2  Without limiting the generality of Subsection 14.1, a
   representative of Franchisor shall be present in the Restaurant to consult
   with Franchisee or its General Manager once each calendar quarter and, at
   least semi-annually, a representative shall conduct an inspection/
   consultation at the Restaurant (which may be conducted with or without
   notice).  During such inspection, Franchisor's representative will inspect
   the condition of the Restaurant and observe procedures and operations at
   the Restaurant.  Also during the inspection/consultation, Franchisor's
   representative will meet with the General Manager and such other
   Restaurant employees as Franchisor's representative may designate, for the
   purpose of evaluating the condition and operation of the Restaurant and
   seeking to maintain or achieve compliance with the standards,
   specifications, requirements and instructions contained in this Agreement
   and in the Manuals.

       14.3  Without limiting the generality of Subsection 14.1, Franchisor's
   representatives shall have the right at all times during normal business
   hours to confer with Restaurant employees and customers, and to inspect
   Franchisee's books, records and tax returns, or such portions thereof as
   pertain to the operation of the Restaurant.  All such books, records and
   tax returns shall be kept and maintained at the principal executive
   offices of Franchisee or such other place as may be agreed upon by the
   parties in writing.  If any inspection reveals that the gross sales
   reported in any report or statement are less than the actual gross sales
   ascertained by such inspection, then the Franchisee shall immediately pay
   Franchisor the additional amount of fees owing by reason of the
   understatement of gross sales previously reported, together with interest
   as provided in Subsection 9.2.  In the event that any report or statement
   understates gross sales by more than three percent (3%) of the actual
   gross sales ascertained by Franchisor's inspection, Franchisee shall, in
   addition to making the payment provided for in the immediately preceding
   sentence, pay and reimburse Franchisor for any and all expenses incurred
   in connection with its inspection, including, but not limited to,
   reasonable accounting and legal fees.  Such payments shall be without
   prejudice to any other rights or remedies which Franchisor may have under
   this Agreement or otherwise.  If any inspection reveals that the gross
   sales reported in any report or statement are greater than the actual
   gross sales ascertained by such inspection, and that Franchisee thereby
   has made an overpayment of fees, the amount of the overpayment (without
   interest) shall be offset against future fees owing by Franchisee to
   Franchisor.

       14.4  Franchisee shall maintain an accurate stock register.  In the
   event that the beneficial ownership of Franchisee's stock differs in any
   respect from record ownership, Franchisee also shall maintain a list of
   the names, addresses and interests of all beneficial owners of its stock. 
   Franchisee shall produce its stock register, and any list of beneficial
   owners certified by the corporation's secretary to be correct, at its
   principal executive offices upon ten (10) days prior written request by
   Franchisor.  Franchisor's representatives shall have the right to examine
   the stock register and any list of beneficial owners, and to reproduce all
   or any part thereof.  Further, upon ten (10) days written notice,
   Franchisor may request a copy of the list of stockholders and owners of
   beneficial interests to be forwarded to it at Franchisor's principal
   office.


   15.     RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION

       15.1  Franchisee is not, and shall not represent or hold itself out
   as, an agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee or
   servant of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever and, where permitted by
   law to do so, shall file a business certificate to such effect with the
   proper recording authorities.  Franchisee is an independent contractor and
   is not authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty or
   representation on behalf of Franchisor, or to create any obligation,
   express or implied, on behalf of Franchisor.  Franchisee agrees that
   Franchisor does not have any fiduciary obligation to Franchisee. 
   Franchisee shall not use the name Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar
   (other than in connection with the operation of the Restaurant), or
   Applebee's International, Inc., or any similar words as part of or in
   association with any trade name of any business entity which is, directly
   or indirectly, associated with Franchisee.

       15.2  Franchisee shall indemnify and hold harmless Franchisor and its
   officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns
   from and against (a) any and all claims based upon, arising out of, or in
   any way related to the operation or condition of any part of the
   Restaurant or Restaurant premises, the conduct of business thereat, the
   ownership or possession of real or personal property, and any negligent
   act, misfeasance or nonfeasance by Franchisee or any of its agents,
   contractors, servants, employees or licensees (including, without
   limitation, the performance by Franchisee of any act required by, or
   performed pursuant to, any provision of this Agreement), and (b) any and
   all fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees), costs and other expenses
   incurred by or on behalf of Franchisor in the investigation of or defense
   against any and all such claims.

       15.3  In addition to, and not in limitation of, any subsection hereof,
   Franchisee specifically covenants, represents and warrants that Franchisee
   is in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state,
   municipal and local laws governing the generation, use or disposal of
   hazardous waste or hazardous materials, and any and all other laws
   designed to protect the environment and that:

       so as to require a permit or approval from the Environmental
       Protection Agency pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
       of 1984 (96 Stat. 3221) or any other federal, state, county or
       municipal agency charged with the responsibility of protecting the
       environment;

            (c)   The Premises have not previously been used, are not now
       being used, and are not contemplated to be used, for the generation,
       transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of any hazardous waste;

            (d)   No portion of the Premises are located on or over a
       "sanitary landfill" or an "open dump" within the meaning of the
       Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6941 et seq.), as
       amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (96 Stat.
       3221);

            (e)   No asbestos fibers or materials or polychlorinated
       biphenyls (PCB's) are on or in the Premises;

            (f)   There have not been, nor are there presently pending, any
       federal or state enforcement actions against the Premises, nor is the
       Franchisee or its Landlord, if any, subject to any outstanding
       administrative orders which require ongoing compliance efforts in
       connection with compliance with laws designed to protect the
       environment;

       governmental or regulatory agency;

            (k)   The Franchisee maintains all insurance policies as may be
       required by any applicable law governing the environment;

            (l)   The Franchisee has no reason to believe that any operation
       of equipment on or at the Premises may be the cause of a future spill
       or release of a pollutant;

            (m)   The Franchisee has not in the past, nor is it presently,
       generating, transporting or disposing of a hazardous substance as

            (n)   The Franchisor shall have the right, at Franchisee's
       expense, to require an environmental audit of the Premises from a
       company or companies satisfactory to Franchisor.

   16.     INSURANCE

       16.1  Franchisee shall procure before the commencement of Restaurant
   operations, and shall maintain in full force and effect during the entire
   term of this Agreement, at its sole cost and expense, an insurance policy
   or policies protecting Franchisee and Franchisor and their respective
   officers, directors and employees against any and all claims, loss,
   liability or expense whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with the
   condition, operation, use or occupancy of the Restaurant or Restaurant
   Premises.  Franchisee shall procure workers' compensation coverage for
   each of its employees no later than the first date of such employee's
   employment.  Franchisee shall also insure the Restaurant building and
   other improvements, equipment, signs, interior and exterior decor items,
   furnishings and fixtures, and any additions thereto, in accordance with
   standard fire and extended coverage insurance policies then in effect for
   similar businesses.  Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured in
   all such policies, workers' compensation excepted, and the certificate or
   certificates of insurance shall state that the policy or policies shall
   not be subject to cancellation or alteration without at least thirty (30)
   days prior written notice to Franchisor.  Such policy or policies shall be
   written by a responsible insurance company or companies satisfactory to
   Franchisor, and shall be in such form and contain such limits of liability
   as shall be satisfactory to Franchisor from time to time.  In any event,
   such policy or policies shall include at least the following: 

      KIND OF INSURANCE            MINIMUM LIMITS OF LIABILITY

      Workers' Compensation        Statutory

      General Public Liability,    $1,000,000 each person,
      including Product Liability, $1,000,000 each occurrence
      Injury and Liquor Liability

      Fire and Extended Coverage   Full replacement value

      Umbrella Liability Insurance $2,000,000


   Franchisee shall, upon request, exhibit certificates of such insurance to
   Franchisor.  The insurance afforded by the policy or policies respecting
   public liability shall not be limited in any way by reason of any
   insurance which may be maintained by Franchisor.

       16.2  Within sixty (60) days after the execution of this Agreement,
   but in no event later than the day before the Restaurant opens for
   business, Franchisee shall submit to Franchisor for approval certificates
   of insurance showing compliance with the requirements of Subsection 16.1. 
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Franchisee shall submit to Franchisor for
   approval certificates of insurance showing compliance with the worker's
   compensation requirements set forth in Subsection 16.1 prior to the
   training of any Franchisee employee at a Restaurant operated by
   Franchisor.  Maintenance of such insurance and the performance by
   Franchisee of its obligations under this Section 16 shall not relieve
   Franchisee of liability under the indemnity provisions of this Agreement,
   and shall not limit such liability.

       16.3  Should Franchisee, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain
   the insurance coverage required by this Section, then Franchisor shall
   have the right and authority to immediately procure such insurance
   coverage and to charge the cost thereof to Franchisee, which amounts shall
   be paid immediately upon notice and shall be subject to charges for late
   payments in the manner set forth in Subsection 9.2.

       16.4  No later than thirty (30) days following Franchisee's receipt of
   same, Franchisee shall submit to Franchisor a copy of any written report
   relating to the condition of the Restaurant premises, or any aspect
   thereof, prepared by an insurer or prospective insurer or by a
   representative of a federal, state or local government agency, provided
   that if any such report contains comments or information which could
   materially and detrimentally affect the Restaurant, such report shall be
   submitted to Franchisor within three (3) days following Franchisee's
   receipt thereof.


   17.     DEBTS AND TAXES

       Franchisee shall pay or cause to be paid promptly when due all
   obligations incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with the
   Restaurant and its operation, including, without limitation, (a) all taxes
   and assessments that may be assessed against the Restaurant land, building
   and other improvements, equipment, fixtures, signs, furnishings, and other
   property; (b) all liens and encumbrances of every kind and character
   created or placed upon or against any of said property, and; (c) all
   accounts and other indebtedness of every kind and character incurred by or
   on behalf of Franchisee in the conduct of the Restaurant business. 
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Franchisee will not be in default of this
   Agreement as a result of a non-payment or non-performance of the foregoing
   so long as it disputes said debt or lien and is, in the sole opinion of
   Franchisor, validly and in good faith pursuing a resolution of said claim
   or lien and has reserved sufficient sums to pay the debt/claim as is
   agreed to by Franchisor.


   18.     TRADE NAMES, SERVICE MARKS AND TRADEMARKS

       18.1  Franchisee acknowledges the sole and exclusive right of
   Franchisor (except for rights granted under existing and future franchise
   agreements) to use Franchisor's trade names, service marks and trademarks
   in connection with the products and services to which they are or may be
   applied by Franchisor, and represents, warrants and agrees that Franchisee
   shall not, either during the term of this Agreement, or after the
   expiration or other termination hereof, directly or indirectly, contest or
   aid in contesting the validity, ownership or use thereof by Franchisor, or
   take any action whatsoever in derogation of the rights claimed herein by
   Franchisor.

       18.2  The right granted to Franchisee under this Agreement to use
   Franchisor's trade names, service marks and trademarks is nonexclusive,
   and Franchisor, in its sole discretion, subject only to the limitations
   contained in Subsection 1.4 of this Agreement, has the right to grant
   other rights in, to and under those names and marks in addition to those
   rights already granted, and to develop and grant rights in other names and
   marks on any such terms and conditions as Franchisor deems appropriate. 
   The rights granted under this Agreement do not include any right or
   authority of any kind whatsoever to pre-package or sell pre-packaged food
   products under any of Franchisor's names or marks.

       18.3  Franchisee understands and acknowledges and agrees that
   Franchisor has the unrestricted right, subject only to the limitations
   contained in Subsection 1.4 of this Agreement, to engage, directly and
   indirectly, through its employees, representatives, licenses, assigns,
   agents, and others, at wholesale, retail, and otherwise, in (a) the
   production, distribution and sale of products under the names and marks
   licensed hereunder or other names or marks, and (b) the use, in connection
   with such production, distribution and sale, of any and all trademarks,
   trade names, service marks, logos, insignia, slogans, emblems, symbols,
   designs and other identifying characteristics as may be developed or used,
   from time to time, by Franchisor.

       18.4  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to vest
   in Franchisee any right, title or interest in or to any of Franchisor's
   names or marks, the goodwill now or hereafter associated therewith, or any
   right in the design of any restaurant building or premises, or the decor
   or trade-dress of the Restaurant, other than the rights and license
   expressly granted herein for the term hereof.  Any and all goodwill
   associated with or identified by any of Franchisor's names or marks shall
   inure directly and exclusively to the benefit of Franchisor, including,
   without limitation, any goodwill resulting from operation and promotion of
   the Restaurant, provided that this Subsection shall not be construed to
   entitle Franchisor to receive any portion of the consideration paid to
   Franchisee and/or any Principal Shareholder as a result of a Transfer of
   an Interest pursuant to Section 12 hereof.

       18.5  Franchisee shall adopt and use Franchisor's names and marks only
   in a manner expressly approved by Franchisor, and shall not use any of
   Franchisor's names or marks in connection with any statement or material
   which may, in the judgment of Franchisor, be in bad taste or inconsistent
   with Franchisor's public image, or tend to bring disparagement, ridicule
   or scorn upon Franchisor, any of Franchisor's names or marks, or the
   goodwill associated therewith.  Franchisee shall not adopt, use or
   register as its corporate name (by filling a certificate or articles of
   incorporation or otherwise) any trade or business name, style or design
   which includes, or is similar to, any of Franchisor's trademarks, service
   marks, trade names, logos, insignia, slogans, emblems, symbols, designs or
   other identifying characteristics.

       18.6  Franchisor shall have the right, at any time and from time to
   time, upon notice to Franchisee, to make additions to, deletions from and
   changes in any of Franchisor's names or marks, or all of them, all of
   which additions, deletions and changes shall be made in good faith, on a
   reasonable basis and with a view toward the overall best interests of the
   System.  Franchisor will use its best efforts to protect and preserve the
   integrity and validity of Franchisor's names and marks, including the
   taking of actions deemed by Franchisor to be appropriate in the event of
   any apparent infringement of any of Franchisor's names or marks.

       18.7  (a)  Franchisor shall hold Franchisee harmless from any
   liability or expense (but excluding consequential damages) resulting from
   infringement of a third party's service mark, trade name or trademark by
   Franchisor's service mark, Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar, or by any
   other service mark, trademark or trade name of Franchisor which Franchisor
   shall designate as part of the System.  This hold-harmless indemnity shall
   not apply to any unauthorized use by Franchisee of any such service mark,
   trade name or trademark.

            (b)   Franchisee agrees to notify Franchisor promptly in writing
   of any suit or claim for infringement which is within the scope of the
   hold-harmless indemnity set forth in this Subsection 18.7.  Subject to the
   terms and conditions of this Subsection 18.7, Franchisor shall have the
   sole right to defend or settle any such suit or claim of infringement at
   Franchisor's expense.  Franchisee, at Franchisee's expense, shall have the
   right to be represented by counsel.  Franchisor shall, however, retain
   control of any negotiations with respect to such claim or of any
   litigation involving such suit.  Franchisee agrees to cooperate with
   Franchisor and to assist Franchisor whenever reasonably requested by
   Franchisor, at Franchisor's expense, in the defense of any such
   infringement suit or claim.  Franchisee shall not enter into any
   settlement of any such claim or suit or conduct any settlement
   negotiations relative thereto without the prior approval of Franchisor in
   writing and, if Franchisee does so, the hold-harmless indemnity set forth
   in this Subsection 18.7 shall be deemed to have been waived and released
   in all respects.

       18.8  Franchisor represents that it is the sole owner of the service
   mark Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar.  In the event that Franchisee is
   precluded from operating the Restaurant because Franchisor determines that
   a third person has acquired rights under the law of any state in such
   mark, which so precludes Franchisee, Franchisor agrees (a) to repay to
   Franchisee the initial franchise fee paid by Franchisee with respect to
   the Restaurant, and (b) to assist Franchisee, at Franchisee's request, in
   locating an alternative site for the Restaurant.


   19.     EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION;
       OPTION TO PURCHASE RESTAURANT; ATTORNEYS' FEES

       19.1   Franchisor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
   immediately upon written notice to Franchisee stating the reason for such
   termination:

            (a)   in the event of any breach or default of any of the
       provisions of Subsection 9.1, Sections 12 or 13, Subsection 14.1 or
       Section 23;

            (b)   if a petition in bankruptcy, an arrangement for the benefit
       of creditors, or a petition for reorganization is filed by Franchisee,
       or is filed against Franchisee and not dismissed within ninety (90)
       days from the filing thereof, or if Franchisee shall make any
       assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver or trustee
       is appointed for Franchisee and is not dismissed within ninety (90)
       days of such appointment;

            (c)   if Franchisee ceases to operate the Restaurant without the
       prior written consent of Franchisor or loses its right to possession
       of the Restaurant premises; provided however, this provision will not
       apply if Franchisee ceases to operate the Restaurant or loses its
       right to possession of the Restaurant premises by reason of Force
       Majeure and Franchisee complies with the requirements of Section 24 of
       this Agreement;

            (d)   if Franchisor discovers that Franchisee has made any
       material misrepresentation or omitted any material fact in the
       information which was furnished to Franchisor in connection with this
       Agreement;

            (e)   if any part of this Agreement relating to the payment of
       fees to Franchisor, or the preservation of any of Franchisor's trade
       names, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets or secret formulae
       licensed or disclosed hereunder is, for any reason, declared invalid
       or unenforceable; or

            (f)   if Franchisee or any Principal Shareholder is convicted of
       or pleads nolo contendere to a felony or any crime involving moral
       turpitude.

       If Franchisee defaults in the performance or observance of any of its
   other obligations hereunder, and such default continues for a period of
   sixty (60) days after written notice to Franchisee specifying such
   default, Franchisor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon
   thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee.  If Franchisee defaults in
   the performance or observance of the same obligation two (2) or more times
   within a twelve (12) month period, Franchisor shall have the right to
   terminate this Agreement immediately upon commission of the second act of
   default, upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee stating the
   reason for such termination, without allowance for any curative period.

       The foregoing provisions of this Subsection 19.1 are subject to the
   provisions of any local statutes or regulations which limit the grounds
   upon which Franchisor may terminate this Agreement, or which require that
   Franchisor give Franchisee additional prior written notice of termination
   and opportunity to cure any default.

       In the event of termination by reason of Franchisee's failure after a
   good faith effort to obtain the necessary state or local liquor licenses
   (as required in Section 23), Franchisor shall refund to Franchisee,
   without interest, the franchise fee payment referred to in
   Subsection 9.1(a), less any expenses incurred and damages sustained by
   Franchisor in connection with its performance hereunder prior to the date
   of such termination.  Franchisor shall also repay the initial franchise
   fee in the circumstances described in Subsection 18.8 hereof.  In the
   event of termination for any other reason, Franchisor shall have no
   obligation to refund any amount previously paid by Franchisee, and
   Franchisee shall be obligated to promptly pay all sums which are then due
   Franchisor.

       19.2  Upon the termination of this Agreement by Franchisor, Franchisee
   may not remove any property from the Restaurant premises for thirty (30)
   days after the termination.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of
   this Agreement for any reason:

            (a)   Franchisee shall immediately discontinue its use of the
       System and its use of Franchisor's trade names, service marks,
       trademarks, logos, insignia, slogans, emblems, symbols, designs and
       other identifying characteristics;

            (b)   if the Restaurant premises are owned by Franchisee or
       leased from a third party, Franchisee shall, upon demand by
       Franchisor, remove (at Franchisee's expense) Franchisor's trade names,
       service marks, trademarks, logos, insignia, slogans, sign facia,
       emblems, symbols, designs and other identifying characteristics from
       all premises, and paint all premises and other improvements maintained
       pursuant to this Agreement a design and color which is basically
       different from Franchisor's authorized design and color.  If
       Franchisee shall fail to make or cause to be made any such removal or
       repainting within thirty (30) days after written notice, then
       Franchisor shall have the right to enter upon the Restaurant premises,
       without being deemed guilty of trespass or any tort (or Franchisee
       shall cause Franchisor to be permitted on the premises as necessary),
       and make or cause to be made such removal, alterations and repainting
       at the reasonable expense of Franchisee, which expense Franchisee
       shall pay to Franchisor immediately upon demand; and

            (c)   Franchisee shall not thereafter use any trademark, trade
       name, service mark, logo, insignia, slogan, emblem, symbol, design or
       other identifying characteristic that is in any way associated with
       Franchisor or similar to those associated with Franchisor, or use any
       food or proprietary menu item, recipe or method of food preparation or
       operate or do business under any name or in any manner that might tend
       to give the public the impression that Franchisee is or was a licensee
       or franchisee of, or otherwise associated with, Franchisor.

       19.3  In the event that any part to this Agreement initiates any legal
   proceeding to construe or enforce any of the terms, conditions and/or
   provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, its
   termination provisions and its provisions requiring Franchisee to make
   certain payments to Franchisor incident to the operation of the
   Restaurant, or to obtain damages or other relief to which any such party
   may be entitled by virtue of this Agreement, the prevailing party or
   parties shall be paid its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses by the
   other party or parties.  If Franchisee fails to comply with a written
   notice of termination sent by Franchisor and a court later upholds such
   termination of this Agreement, Franchisee's operation of the Restaurant,
   from and after the date of termination stated in such notice, shall
   constitute willful trademark infringement and unfair competition by
   Franchisee, and Franchisee shall be liable to Franchisor for damages
   resulting from such infringement in addition to any fees paid or payable
   hereunder, including, without limitation, any profits which Franchisee
   derived from such post-termination operation of the Restaurant.

       19.4  (a)  With respect to Restaurant premises owned by Franchisee, in
   the event of termination of this Agreement, Franchisor shall have, for
   thirty (30) days after the termination is effective, an option,
   exercisable upon written notice to Franchisee within such thirty (30) day
   period, to elect to purchase the Restaurant premises from Franchisee for
   the fair market value of the land and buildings, furnishings and equipment
   located therein.

            (b)   In addition to the option described above, Franchisor shall
   have an option, exercisable upon written notice to Franchisee, to elect to
   purchase the Restaurant premises from Franchisee upon expiration of this
   Agreement for the fair market value of the land and buildings,
   furnishings, and equipment located therein subject to Franchisee's option
   to operate the Restaurant for an additional term under Subsection 1.3
   hereof.  If Franchisee does not notify Franchisor, pursuant to
   Subsection 1.3 hereof, of a desire to operate the Restaurant for an
   additional term, then Franchisor shall provide the written notice
   described in the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the
   latest date by which Franchisee is required by Subsection 1.3 to advise
   Franchisor of such a desire; if Franchisee does notify Franchisor of a
   desire to operate the Restaurant for an additional term and Franchisor
   determines that Franchisee is not eligible to do so, Franchisor shall
   provide the written notice described in the preceding sentence within
   thirty (30) days of its written notice to Franchisee that Franchisee is
   not eligible to operate the Restaurant for such additional term.  With
   respect to the option to purchase upon expiration of this Agreement, this
   option shall not apply if prior to thirty (30) days before said
   expiration, Franchisee enters into an agreement to sell such Restaurant
   premises to a third party upon the expiration of the Franchise Agreement,
   provided that Franchisee's agreement with the purchaser includes a
   covenant by the purchaser, which is expressly enforceable by Franchisor as
   a third-party beneficiary thereof, pursuant to which the purchaser agrees
   that, for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration of this
   Agreement, the purchaser shall not use such premises for the operation of
   a restaurant business whose menu or method of operation is similar to that
   employed by restaurant units within the System.

            (c)   If Franchisee receives approval to operate the Restaurant
   premises for an additional term in accordance with Subsection 1.3 hereof,
   Franchisee will be required to execute the then-existing form of franchise
   agreement, which shall contain an option to obtain assignment of
   Franchisee's lease with a third party and/or to purchase certain property,
   exercisable by Franchisor upon termination thereof, and an option to
   purchase the Restaurant premises, exercisable by Franchisor upon
   expiration of the additional term (subject to any then-existing rights to
   renew of Franchisee).  Such options shall be substantially similar to the
   provisions described in this Subsection 19.4.

            (d)   If the parties cannot agree on the purchase price or other
   terms of purchase within thirty (30) days following Franchisor's exercise
   of its option pursuant to Subsection 19.4(a) and (b), the price or
   disputed terms of purchase shall be determined by three (3) appraisers,
   with each party selecting one (1) appraiser and the two (2) appraisers, so
   chosen, selecting the third appraiser.  In the event of such an appraisal,
   each party shall bear its own legal and other costs and shall split the
   appraisal fees.  The appraisers' determination of the price and other
   disputed terms of purchase shall be final and binding.

            (e)   If Franchisor elects to exercise its option to purchase
   upon termination of this Agreement, the purchase price shall be paid
   within thirty (30) days of the determination of the purchase price and
   other terms of purchase.  If Franchisor elects to exercise its option to
   purchase upon expiration of this Agreement, the purchase price shall be
   paid within thirty (30) days of the later of (a) the determination of the
   purchase price and other terms of purchase, or (b) expiration of this
   Agreement.  If the Franchisor does not elect to exercise its option to
   purchase the Restaurant premises, the Franchisee may sell such premises to
   a third party, provided that Franchisee's agreement with the purchaser
   includes a covenant by the purchaser, which is expressly enforceable by
   Franchisor as a third-party beneficiary thereof, pursuant to which the
   purchaser agrees that it shall not use such premises for the operation of
   a restaurant business whose menu or method of operation is similar to that
   employed by restaurant units within the System for a period of twelve (12)
   months after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

            (f)   If the Restaurant premises are leased by Franchisee from a
   third party, such lease must allow Franchisee to assign the lease to
   Franchisor.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Franchisor
   has the right, exercisable upon written notice to Franchisee within
   thirty (30) days after termination is effective, to require Franchisee to
   assign all Franchisee's rights and obligations under the lease to
   Franchisor and to immediately surrender possession of the premises,
   including all fixtures and leasehold improvements, to Franchisor.  The
   lessor may not impose any assignment fee or other similar charge on
   Franchisor in connection with such assignment.  If Franchisor exercises
   that right, it has an additional right, to be exercised within thirty (30)
   days after taking possession of the premises, to purchase all of
   Franchisee's equipment, signs, decor items, furnishings, supplies and
   other products and materials at their then-fair market value.  If the
   parties cannot agree on the price, the price will be determined in the
   manner set forth in connection with Franchisee-owned Restaurant premises. 
   If Franchisor elects not to purchase the items mentioned above, Franchisee
   shall, at Franchisee's own expense and under Franchisor's supervision
   remove those items from the premises within ten (10) days after such final
   election, or ten (10) days after expiration of the option period,
   whichever is earlier.  If Franchisee fails to remove all such property
   from the premises within such period, Franchisor shall be entitled to do
   so, or to authorize a third party to do so, all at Franchisee's expense.

       19.5  In addition to the provisions contained in Subsection 19.4
   hereof:

            (a)   With respect to Restaurant premises owned by Franchisee, in
       the event of termination of this Agreement and Franchisor's exercise
       of its option to purchase the Restaurant premises pursuant to
       Subsection 19.4(a) hereof, Franchisee shall have, for ten (10) days
       after its receipt of written notice of Franchisor's election to
       purchase, an option, exercisable upon written notice to Franchisor, to
       lease said premises to Franchisor, pursuant to a lease which provides
       for rental at a rate not in excess of six percent (6%) of gross sales
       and triple net terms.  Said lease shall provide for a lease term of at
       least ten (10) years with two (2) five (5)-year options to renew, and
       for primary annual rent of not in excess of the number derived from
       multiplying six percent (6%) times the gross sales reported by
       Franchisee to Franchisor for which Franchisee has paid a royalty fee
       for the next preceding calendar year times eighty percent (80%).

            (b)   In addition to the option described above, Franchisee shall
       have an option, exercisable upon written notice to Franchisor, to
       elect to lease the Restaurant premises to Franchisor upon expiration
       of this Agreement and Franchisor's exercise of its option to purchase
       the Restaurant premises pursuant to Subsection 19.4(b) hereof,
       pursuant to the same terms set forth in Subsection 19.5(a) above,
       subject to Franchisee's option to operate the Restaurant for an
       additional term under Subsection 1.3 hereof.  If (i) Franchisee does
       not notify Franchisor, pursuant to Subsection 1.3 hereof, of a desire
       to operate the Restaurant for an additional term, or (ii) Franchisee
       does notify Franchisor of a desire to operate the Restaurant for an
       additional term and Franchisor determines that Franchisee is not
       eligible to do so, and Franchisor exercises its option to purchase the
       Restaurant premises, then Franchisee shall provide the written notice
       described in the preceding sentence within ten (10) days after its
       receipt of written notice of Franchisor's election to purchase.  With
       respect to the option to lease upon expiration of this Agreement, this
       option shall not apply if prior to thirty (30) days before said
       expiration, Franchisee enters into an agreement to sell such
       Restaurant premises to a third party upon the expiration of the
       Franchise Agreement, provided that Franchisee's agreement with the
       purchaser includes a covenant by the purchaser, which is expressly
       enforceable by Franchisor as a third-party beneficiary thereof,
       pursuant to which the purchaser agrees, at Franchisor's option, either
       to lease said premises to Franchisor upon the terms set forth in
       Subsection 19.5(a), or that for a period of twelve (12) months after
       the expiration of this Agreement, the purchaser shall not use such
       premises for the operation of a restaurant business whose menu or
       method of operation is similar to that employed by restaurant units
       within the System.

            (c)   If Franchisee receives approval to operate the Restaurant
       premises for an additional term in accordance with Subsection 1.3
       hereof, Franchisee will be required to execute the then-existing form
       of franchise agreement which shall contain an option to obtain
       assignment of Franchisee's lease with a third party and/or to lease
       certain property, exercisable by Franchisor upon termination thereof,
       and an option to lease the Restaurant premises, exercisable by
       Franchisor upon expiration of the additional term (subject to any
       then-existing rights to renew of Franchisee).  Such options shall be
       substantially similar to the provisions described in this Subsection
       19.5.


   20.     NO WAIVER OF DEFAULT

       20.1  The waiver by any party to this Agreement of any breach or
   default, or series of breaches or defaults, of any term, covenant or
   condition herein, or of any same or similar term, covenant or condition
   contained in any other agreement between Franchisor and any franchisee,
   shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent or continuing breach or
   default of the same or any other term, covenant or condition contained in
   this Agreement, or in any other agreement between Franchisor and any
   franchisee.

       20.2  All rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be
   cumulative and not alternative, in addition to and not exclusive of any
   other rights or remedies which are provided for herein or which may be
   available at law or in equity in case of any breach, failure or default or
   threatened breach, failure or default of any term, provision or condition
   of this Agreement.  The rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be
   continuing and shall not be exhausted by any one (1) or more uses thereof,
   and may be exercised at any time or from time to time as often as may be
   expedient; and any option or election to enforce any such right or remedy
   may be exercised or taken at any time and from time to time.  The
   expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement shall not discharge or
   release Franchisee or any Principal Shareholder from any liability or
   obligation then accrued, or any liability or obligation continuing beyond,
   or arising out of, the expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement.


   21.     CONSTRUCTION, SEVERABILITY,
       GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

       21.1  If any part of this Agreement shall for any reason be declared
   invalid, unenforceable or impaired in any way, the validity of the
   remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect as if the
   Agreement had been executed with such invalid portion eliminated, and it
   is hereby declared the intention of the parties that they would have
   executed the remaining portion of this Agreement without including therein
   any such portions which might be declared invalid; provided however, that
   in the event any part hereof relating to the payment of fees to
   Franchisor, or the preservation of any of Franchisor's trade names,
   service marks, trademarks, trade secrets or secret formulae licensed or
   disclosed hereunder is for any reason declared invalid or unenforceable,
   then Franchisor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon
   written notice to Franchisee.  If any clause or provision herein would be
   deemed invalid or unenforceable as written, it shall be deemed modified or
   limited to such extent or in such manner as may be necessary to render the
   clause or provision valid and enforceable to the greatest extent possible
   in light of the interest of the parties expressed in that clause or
   provision, subject to the provisions of the preceding sentence.

       21.2  FRANCHISEE AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
   FRANCHISOR MAY GRANT NUMEROUS FRANCHISES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ON
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND
   THAT IT IS OF MUTUAL BENEFIT TO FRANCHISEE AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS AND
   TO FRANCHISOR THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BE UNIFORMLY INTERPRETED. 
   THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAW OF THE STATE
   OF MISSOURI DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH LOCAL FRANCHISE STATUTES, RULES AND
   REGULATIONS, MISSOURI LAW SHALL APPLY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS
   AGREEMENT AND SHALL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS WHICH ARISE WITH REFERENCE
   HERETO; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT PROVISIONS OF MISSOURI LAW REGARDING
   CONFLICTS OF LAW SHALL NOT APPLY HERETO.

       21.3  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING
   OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF WHICH
   CANNOT BE AMICABLY SETTLED, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, MAY, AT
   THE OPTION OF THE CLAIMANT, BE RESOLVED BY A PROCEEDING IN A COURT IN
   JACKSON COUNTY, MISSOURI, AND FRANCHISEE AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS EACH
   IRREVOCABLY ACCEPT THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI
   AND THE FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN JACKSON COUNTY, MISSOURI FOR SUCH
   CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES.

       The parties agree that service of process in any proceeding arising
   out of or relating to this Agreement or the performance thereof may be
   made as to Franchisee and any Principal Shareholder by serving a person of
   suitable age and discretion (such as the person in charge of the office)
   at the address of Franchisee specified in this Agreement and as to
   Franchisor by serving the president or a vice-president of Franchisor at
   the address of Franchisor or by serving Franchisor's registered agent.


   22.     INTERFERENCE WITH EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS

       During the term of this Agreement, neither Franchisor nor Franchisee
   shall employ or seek to employ in a managerial position (i.e., in a
   position at a pay grade at or above that of Assistant Restaurant Manager
   or Kitchen Manager), directly or indirectly, any person who is at the time
   or was at any time during the prior six (6) months employed by the other
   party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or by any franchisee in
   the System.  This section shall not be violated if, at the time Franchisor
   or Franchisee employs or seeks to employ such person, such former employer
   has given its written consent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
   this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge that if this Section is
   violated, such former employer shall be entitled to liquidated damages
   equal to three (3) times the annual salary of the employee involved, plus
   reimbursement of all costs and attorneys' fees incurred.  In addition to
   the rights granted to the parties hereto, the parties acknowledge and
   agree that any franchisee from which an employee was hired by either party
   to this Agreement in violation of the terms of this Section shall be
   deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this provision and may sue and
   recover against the offending party the liquidated damages herein set
   forth; provided however, the failure by Franchisee to enforce this Section
   shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section.


   23.     LIQUOR LICENSE

       The grant of the rights which are the subject of this Agreement is
   expressly conditioned upon the ability of the Franchisee to obtain and
   maintain any and all required state and/or local licenses permitting the
   sale of liquor by the drink on the Restaurant premises, and Franchisee
   agrees to use its best efforts to obtain such licenses.  In the event
   Franchisee fails, after a good faith effort, to obtain any and all such
   required liquor licenses prior to the date on which the Restaurant is
   otherwise ready to open for business, then, at the option of the
   Franchisor, this Agreement may be terminated forthwith by Franchisor upon
   written notice to Franchisee, in which event, Franchisor shall refund to
   Franchisee, without interest, the initial franchise fee payment referred
   to in Subsection 9.1, less any expenses incurred and damages sustained by
   Franchisor in connection with its performance hereunder prior to the date
   of such termination.  After obtaining the necessary state or local liquor
   licenses, Franchisee shall thereafter comply with all applicable laws and
   regulations relating to the sale of liquor on the Restaurant premises. 
   If, during any twelve (12) month period during the term of this Agreement,
   Franchisee is prohibited for any reason from selling liquor on the
   Restaurant premises for more than thirty (30) days because of a violation
   or violations of state or local liquor laws, then at the option of
   Franchisor this Agreement may be terminated forthwith by Franchisor upon
   written notice to Franchisee.


   24.     FORCE MAJEURE

       24.1  As used in this Agreement, the term "Force Majeure" shall mean
   any act of God, strike, lock-out or other industrial disturbance, war
   (declared or undeclared), riot, epidemic, fire or other catastrophe, act
   of any government and any other similar cause not within the control of
   the party affected thereby.

       24.2  If the performance of any obligation by any party under this
   Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of Force Majeure,
   which cannot be overcome by use of normal commercial measures, the parties
   shall be relieved of their respective obligations to the extent the
   parties are respectively necessarily prevented, hindered or delayed in
   such performance during the period of such Force Majeure.  The party whose
   performance is affected by an event of Force Majeure shall give prompt
   notice of such Force Majeure event to the other party by telephone or
   telegram (in each case to be confirmed in writing), setting forth the
   nature thereof and an estimate as to its duration, and shall be liable for
   failure to give such timely notice only to the extent of damage actually
   caused.

       24.3  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 24, if, as a
   result of an event of Force Majeure (including condemnation proceedings),
   the Franchisee ceases to operate the Restaurant or loses the right to
   possession of the Restaurant premises, Franchisee shall apply within
   thirty (30) days after the event of Force Majeure for Franchisor's
   approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the Restaurant.  If relocation is
   necessary, Franchisor agrees to use its reasonable efforts to assist
   Franchisee in locating an alternative site in the same general area where
   Franchisee can operate a Restaurant within the System for the balance of
   the term of the Franchise Agreement.  If Franchisor so assists Franchisee,
   Franchisee shall reimburse Franchisor for its reasonable out-of-pocket
   expenses incurred as a result thereof.  (This provision shall not be
   construed to prevent Franchisee from receiving the full amount of any
   condemnation award of damages relating to the closing of the Restaurant;
   provided however, that if Franchisor or an affiliate is the lessor of the
   Restaurant premises, Franchisee specifically waives and releases any claim
   it may have for the value of any building, fixtures and other improvements
   on the premises, whether or not installed or paid for by the Franchisee,
   and Franchisee agrees to subordinate any claim it may have to Franchisor's
   claim for such improvements.)  Selection of an alternative location will
   be subject to the site approval procedures set forth in Section 5 of the
   Development Agreement.  Once Franchisee has obtained Franchisor's approval
   to relocate and/or reconstruct the Restaurant, Franchisee must diligently
   pursue relocation and/or reconstruction until the Restaurant is reopened
   for business.


   25.     MISCELLANEOUS

   change of address to the sending party, in which event the new address so

                  REVIEW AND CONSENT WITH RESPECT TO TRANSFERS


        In determining whether to grant or to withhold consent to a proposed
   Transfer, Franchisor shall consider all of the facts and circumstances
   which it views as relevant in the particular instance, including, but not
   limited to, any of the following:  (i) work experience and aptitude of
   Proposed New Owner and/or proposed new management (a proposed transferee
   of a Principal Shareholder's Interest and/or a proposed transferee of this
   Agreement is referred to as "Proposed New Owner"); (ii) financial
   background and condition of Proposed New Owner, and actual and pro forma
   financial condition of Franchisee; (iii) character and reputation of
   Proposed New Owner; (iv) conflicting interests of Proposed New Owner;
   (v) the terms and conditions of Proposed New Owner's rights, if the
   proposed Transfer is a pledge or hypothecation; (vi) the adequacy of
   Franchisee's operation of any Restaurant and compliance with the System
   and this Agreement; and (vii) such other criteria and conditions as
   Franchisor shall then consider relevant in the case of an application for
   a new franchise to operate a restaurant unit within the System by an
   applicant that is not then currently doing so.  Franchisor's consent also
   may be conditioned upon execution by Proposed New Owner of an agreement
   whereby Proposed New Owner assumes full, unconditional, joint and several
   liability for, and agrees to perform from the date of such Transfer, all
   obligations, covenants and agreements contained herein to the same extent
   as if it had been an original party to this Agreement and may also require
   Franchisee and Principal Shareholders, including the proposed
   Transferor(s), to execute a general release which releases Franchisor from
   any claims they may have had or then have against Franchisor.  In the
   event Proposed New Owner is a partnership (including, but not limited to,
   a limited partnership), Proposed New Owner will also be required to
   execute an addendum to the Agreement which amends the references to
   Franchisee and its Principal Shareholders to include the partnership
   approved by Franchisor and Proposed New Owner's general partner(s) and the
   principal shareholders of the general partner(s), if the general
   partner(s) is a corporation.  This addendum will contain a provision
   including in the definition of "Transfer" the withdrawal, removal or
   voluntary/involuntary dissolution (if applicable) of the general
   partner(s) or the substitution or addition of a new general partner. 
   Franchisee or Principal Shareholders, as the case may be, shall provide
   Franchisor with such information as it may require in connection with a
   request for approval of a proposed Transfer.

                        APPENDIX C TO FRANCHISE AGREEMENT

                            CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

        THIS AGREEMENT is made this ________ day of ________________,
   19_______, by and between _______________________________________, a
   _____________ corporation ("Developer"), and __________________________,
   an individual employed by Developer ("Employee").

   WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, APPLEBEE'S INTERNATIONAL, INC. ("Applebee's") is the owner
   of all rights in and to a unique system for the development and operation
   of restaurants (the "System"), which includes proprietary rights in
   valuable trade names, service marks and trademarks, including the service
   mark Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and variations of such mark,
   designs and color schemes for restaurant premises, signs, equipment,
   procedures and formulae for preparing food and beverage products,
   specifications for certain food and beverage products, inventory methods,
   operating methods, financial control concepts, a training facility and
   teaching techniques;

        WHEREAS, Developer is the owner of the exclusive right to develop
   restaurants franchised by Applebee's which utilize the System
   ("Restaurants") for the period and in the territory described in the
   Development Agreement between Applebee's and Developer (the "Development
   Agreement"); and

        WHEREAS, Developer acknowledges that Applebee's information as
   described above was developed over time at great expense, is not generally
   known in the industry and is beyond Developer's own present skills and
   experience, and that to develop it itself would be expensive,
   time-consuming and difficult, that it provides a competitive advantage and
   will be valuable to Developer in the development of its business, and that
   gaining access to it was therefore a primary reason why Developer entered
   into the Development Agreement; and

        WHEREAS, in consideration of Applebee's confidential disclosure to
   Developer of these trade secrets, Developer has agreed to be obligated by
   the terms of Development Agreement to execute, with each employee of
   Developer who will have supervisory authority over the development or
   operation of more than one Restaurant in the Territory described in the
   Development Agreement, a written agreement protecting Applebee's trade
   secrets and confidential information entrusted to Employee;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
   obligations contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

        (1)  The parties acknowledge and agree that Employee is or will be
   employed in a supervisory or managerial capacity and in such capacity will
   have access to information and materials which constitute trade secrets
   and confidential and proprietary information.  The parties further
   acknowledge and agree that any actual or potential direct or indirect
   competitor of Applebee's, or of any of its franchisees, shall not have
   access to such trade secrets and confidential information.

        (2)  The parties acknowledge and agree that the System includes
   trade secrets and confidential information which Applebee's has revealed
   to Developer in confidence, and that protection of said trade secrets and
   confidential information and protection of Applebee's against unfair
   competition from others who enjoy or who have had access to said trade
   secrets and confidential information are essential for the maintenance of
   goodwill and special value of the System.

        (3)  Employee agrees that he or she shall not at any time
   (i) appropriate or use the trade secrets incorporated in the System, or
   any portion thereof, for use in any business which is not within the
   System; (ii) disclose or reveal any portion of the System to any person,
   other than to Developer's employees as an incident of their training;
   (iii) acquire any right to use, or to license or franchise the use of any
   name, mark or other intellectual property right which is or may be granted
   by any franchise agreement between Applebee's and Developer; or
   (iv) communicate, divulge or use for the benefit of any other person or
   entity any confidential information, knowledge or know-how concerning the
   methods of development or operation of a Restaurant which may be
   communicated to Employee or of which Employee may be apprised by virtue of
   Employee's employment by Developer.  Employee shall divulge such
   confidential information only to such of Developer's other employees as
   must have access to that information in order to operate a Restaurant or
   to develop a prospective site for a Restaurant.  Any and information,
   knowledge and know-how, including, without limitation, drawings,
   materials, equipment, specifications, techniques and other data, which
   Applebee's designates as confidential, shall be deemed confidential for
   purposes of this Agreement.

        (4)  Employee further acknowledges and agrees that the Franchise
   Operations Manual and any other materials or manuals provided or made
   available to Developer by Applebee's (collectively, the "Manuals"),
   described in Section 5 of the applicable franchise agreement between
   Applebee's and Developer, are loaned by Applebee's to Developer for
   limited purposes only, remain the property of Applebee's, and may not be
   reproduced, in whole or in part, without the written consent of
   Applebee's.

        (5)  Employee agrees to surrender to Developer or to Applebee's each
   and every copy of the Manuals and any other information or material in his
   or her possession or control upon request, upon termination of employment
   or upon completion of the use for which said Manuals or other information
   or material may have been furnished to Employee.

        (6)  The parties agree that in the event of a breach of this
   Agreement, Applebee's would be irreparably injured and would be without an
   adequate remedy at law.  Therefore, in the event of a breach or a
   threatened or attempted breach of any of the provisions hereof, Applebee's
   shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Agreement as a third-
   party beneficiary hereof and shall be entitled, in addition to any other
   remedies which it may have hereunder at law or in equity (including the
   right to terminate the Development Agreement), to a temporary and/or
   permanent injunction and a decree for specific performance of the terms
   hereof without the necessity of showing actual or threatened damage, and
   without being required to furnish a bond or other security.

        (7)  If any court or other tribunal having jurisdiction to determine
   the validity or enforceability of this Agreement determines that it would
   be invalid or unenforceable as written, the provisions hereof shall be
   deemed to be modified or limited to such extent or in such manner
   necessary for such provisions to be valid and enforceable to the greatest
   extent possible.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have entered into this Agreement
   as of the date first above written.

        In determining whether to grant or to withhold consent to a proposed
   Transfer, Franchisor shall consider all of the facts and circumstances
   which it views as relevant in the particular instance, including, but not
   limited to, any of the following:  (i) work experience and aptitude of

   proposed Transfer is a pledge or hypothecation; (vi) the adequacy of
   Developer's operation (as Franchisee) of any Restaurant and compliance
   with the System and this Agreement; and (vii) such other criteria and
   conditions as Franchisor shall then consider relevant in the case of an
   application for a new franchise to operate a restaurant unit within the
   System by an applicant that is not then currently doing so.  Franchisor's
   consent also may be conditioned upon execution by Proposed New Owner of an
   agreement whereby Proposed New Owner assumes full, unconditional, joint
   and several liability for, and agrees to perform from the date of such
   Transfer, all obligations, covenants and agreements contained herein to
   the same extent as if it had been an original party to this Agreement and
   may also require Developer and Principal Shareholders, including the
   proposed Transferor(s), to execute a general release which releases
   Franchisor from any claims they may have had or then have against
   Franchisor.  In the event Proposed New Owner is a partnership (including,
   but not limited to, a limited partnership), Proposed New Owner will also
   be required to execute an addendum to the Agreement which amends the
   references to Developer and its Principal Shareholders to include the
   partnership approved by Franchisor and Proposed New Owner's general
   partner(s) and the principal shareholders of the general partner(s), if
   the general partner(s) is a corporation.  This addendum will contain a
   provision including in the definition of "Transfer" the withdrawal,
   removal or voluntary/involuntary dissolution (if applicable) of the
   general partner(s) or the substitution or addition of a new general
   partner.  Developer or Principal Shareholders, as the case may be, shall
   provide Franchisor with such information as it may require in connection
   with a request for approval of a proposed Transfer.

                          CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND
                             COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

        THIS AGREEMENT is made this ________ day of ________________,
   19______, by and between _______________________________________, a
   _____________ corporation ("Developer"), and __________________________,
   an individual employed by Developer ("Employee").

   WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, APPLEBEE'S INTERNATIONAL, INC. ("Applebee's") is the owner
   of all rights in and to a unique system for the development and operation
   of restaurants (the "System"), which includes proprietary rights in
   valuable trade names, service marks and trademarks, including the service
   mark Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and variations of such mark,
   designs and color schemes for restaurant premises, signs, equipment,
   procedures and formulae for preparing food and beverage products,
   specifications for certain food and beverage products, inventory methods,
   operating methods, financial control concepts, a training facility and
   teaching techniques;

        WHEREAS, Developer is the owner of the exclusive right to develop
   restaurants franchised by Applebee's which utilize the System
   ("Restaurants") for the period and in the territory described in the
   Development Agreement between Applebee's and Developer (the "Development
   Agreement");

        WHEREAS, Developer acknowledges that Applebee's information as
   described above was developed over time at great expense, is not generally
   known in the industry and is beyond Developer's own present skills and
   experience, and that to develop it itself would be expensive,
   time-consuming and difficult, that it provides a competitive advantage and
   will be valuable to Developer in the development of its business, and that
   gaining access to it was therefore a primary reason why Developer entered
   into the Development Agreement; and

        WHEREAS, in consideration of Applebee's confidential disclosure to
   Developer of these trade secrets, Developer has agreed to be obligated by
   the terms of Development Agreement to execute, with its Director of
   Operations, a written agreement protecting Applebee's trade secrets and
   confidential information entrusted to Employee, and protecting against
   unfair competition;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
   obligations contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

        (1)  The parties acknowledge and agree that Employee is or will be
   employed in a supervisory or managerial capacity and in such capacity will
   have access to information and materials which constitute trade secrets
   and confidential and proprietary information.  The parties further
   acknowledge and agree that any actual or potential direct or indirect
   competitor of Applebee's or of any of its franchisees shall not have
   access to such trade secrets and confidential information.

        (2)  The parties acknowledge and agree that the System includes
   trade secrets and confidential information which Applebee's has revealed
   or will reveal to Developer in confidence, and that protection of said
   trade secrets and confidential information and protection of Applebee's
   against unfair competition from others who enjoy or who have had access to
   said trade secrets and confidential information are essential for the
   maintenance of goodwill and special value of the System.

        (3)  Employee agrees that he or she shall not at any time
   (i) appropriate or use the trade secrets incorporated in the System, or
   any portion thereof, for use in any business which is not within the
   System; (ii) disclose or reveal any portion of the System to any person
   other than to Developer's employees as an incident of their training;
   (iii) acquire any right to use, or to license or franchise the use of any
   name, mark or other intellectual property right which is or may be granted
   by any franchise agreement between Applebee's and Developer; or
   (iv) communicate, divulge or use for the benefit of any other person or
   entity any confidential information, knowledge or know-how concerning the
   methods of development or operation of a Restaurant which may be
   communicated to Employee or of which Employee may be apprised by virtue of
   Employee's employment by Developer.  Employee shall divulge such
   confidential information only to such of Developer's other employees as
   must have access to that information in order to operate a Restaurant or
   to develop a prospective site for a Restaurant.  Any and all information,
   knowledge and know-how, including, without limitation, drawings,
   materials, equipment, specifications, techniques and other data, which
   Applebee's designates as confidential, shall be deemed confidential for
   purposes of this Agreement.

        (4)  Employee agrees that for the duration of his or her employment
   by Developer, and for two (2) years following termination thereof,
   Employee may not, without the prior written consent of Applebee's,
   directly or indirectly, for himself or through, on behalf of or in
   conjunction with any person, partnership or corporation, engage in or
   acquire any financial or beneficial interest (including any interest in
   corporations, partnerships, trusts, unincorporated associations or joint
   ventures) in, advise, help, guarantee loans or make loans to, any
   restaurant business whose menu or method of operation is the same as or
   similar to that employed by restaurant units within the System which is
   located either (a) in the Territory, as defined in the Development
   Agreement, or (b) in the Area of Dominant Influence (as defined and
   established from time to time by Arbitron Ratings Company) of any
   Restaurant developed pursuant to the Development Agreement.

        (5)  Employee further acknowledges and agrees that the Franchise
   Operations Manual and any other materials and manuals provided or made
   available to Developer by Applebee's (collectively, the "Manuals"),
   described in Section 5 of the form of franchise agreement which is
   attached as Appendix B to the Development Agreement are loaned by
   Applebee's to Developer for limited purposes only, remain the property of
   Applebee's, and may not be reproduced, in whole or in part, without the
   written consent of Applebee's.

        (6)  Employee agrees to surrender to Developer or to Applebee's each
   and every copy of the Manuals and any other information or material in his
   or her possession or control upon request, upon termination of employment,
   or upon completion of the use for which said Manuals or other information
   or material may have been furnished to Employee.

        (7)  The parties agree that in the event of a breach of this
   Agreement, Applebee's would be irreparably injured and would be without an
   adequate remedy at law.  Therefore, in the event of a breach or a
   threatened or attempted breach of any of the provisions hereof, Applebee's
   shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this agreement as a third-
   party beneficiary hereof and shall be entitled, in addition to any other
   remedies which it may have hereunder at law or in equity (including the
   right to terminate the Development Agreement), to a temporary and/or
   permanent injunction and a decree for specific performance of the terms
   hereof without the necessity of showing actual or threatened damage, and
   without being required to furnish a bond or other security.

        (8)  The restrictions in Subsection (4) hereof shall not apply to
   ownership of less than two percent (2%) of the shares of a company whose
   shares are traded on a national securities exchange if such shares are
   owned for investment only, and are not owned by an officer, director,
   employee or consultant of such publicly traded company.

        (9)  If any court or other tribunal having jurisdiction to determine
   the validity or enforceability of this Agreement determines that it would
   be invalid or unenforceable as written, the provisions hereof shall be
   deemed to be modified or limited to such extent or in such manner
   necessary for such provisions to be valid and enforceable to the greatest
   extent possible.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have entered into this Agreement
   as of the date first above written.

   legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
   agree as follows:

        1. The parties acknowledge that no rights regarding the Franchisor's
   trade names, trademarks and service marks are granted to Developer
   pursuant to the Development Agreement; however, if Franchisor authorizes

   form for the Franchise Agreement to be used for all future Restaurants
   developed.  If Developer wishes to exercise its option, Developer must
   notify Franchisor in writing within the thirty (30) day option period. 
   Developer acknowledges that its option relates only to the adoption of the
   new form of franchise agreement in its entirety and that Developer may not
   choose to adopt only select provisions of the new form.

        business, except those restaurant businesses listed in

                    SECOND ADDENDUM TO DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT


        THIS SECOND ADDENDUM is made and entered into this ________ day of
   ________________, 19_____, by and between APPLEBEE'S INTERNATIONAL, INC.,
   a Delaware corporation, hereinafter referred to as "Franchisor", MARCUS
   RESTAURANTS, INC., a Wisconsin corporation, hereinafter referred to as
   "Developer".

        WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, Franchisor franchises nationally the Applebee's Neighborhood
   Grill & Bar restaurant system (the "System"), and 

        WHEREAS, contemporaneous with the execution of this Second Addendum
   to Development Agreement, Franchisor and Franchisee have entered into an
   Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar Development Agreement and a First
   Addendum to Development Agreement (collectively, the "Development
   Agreement") whereby Franchisor will grant to Franchisee the right to
   develop Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar Restaurants, as such term is
   defined in the Development Agreement, in a market generally described as a
   portion of the Chicago, Illinois A.D.I. and more specifically defined in
   the Development Agreement (the "Territory"), and

        WHEREAS, an attachment to said Development Agreement is the form
   Franchise Agreement which will be entered between the parties with respect
   to each of said Restaurants, and

        WHEREAS, Article 19 of the Franchise Agreement grants to Franchisor
   certain rights and options with respect to the Restaurant to which each of
   the franchise agreements will refer, and

        WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend and supplement said form
   Franchise Agreement now and in the future as hereinafter set forth,

        NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
   legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
   agree as follows:

        1.   This Agreement shall be a part of the Development Agreement and
   Appendices entered this date to which it is attached, the same as if the
   provisions hereof were an integral part thereof.

        2.   Irrespective of the provisions of Article 19 of the Franchise
   Agreement attached to the Development Agreement as an Appendix or any
   other provision of either the Development Agreement or Franchise
   Agreement, if:

             (i)  All or substantially all of the assets of the Marcus
        Corporation, the principal shareholder of Developer, including the
        assets or stock of Developer, are sold to a third-party purchaser as
        a part of one (1) transaction and so long as the third-party
        purchaser is not a Direct Competitor (as hereinafter defined) of
        Franchisor, as determined by Franchisor in its discretion, and is
        approved by Franchisor as a new franchisee in the manner provided in
        the Development and Franchise Agreements; or

             (ii)  All or substantially all of the assets of Developer,
        including all of its Applebee's Restaurants (both the property and
        the operation thereof), are sold to a third-party purchaser as a part
        of one (1) transaction and so long as the third-party purchaser is
        not a Direct Competitor of Franchisor, as determined by Franchisor in
        its discretion, and is approved by Franchisor as a new franchisee in
        the manner provided in the Development and Franchise Agreements; or

             (iii)  All of Developer's Applebee's Restaurants, including the
        property and the operation thereof, are sold to a third-party
        purchaser as a part of one (1) transaction and so long as the third-
        party purchaser is not a Direct Competitor of Franchisor, as
        determined by Franchisor in its discretion, and is approved by
        Franchisor as a new franchisee in the manner provided in the
        Development and Franchise Agreements;

   then, in any one of such events, the rights and options granted Franchisor
   in Article 19 of the Franchise Agreement to purchase a Restaurant site or
   accept an assignment of the Restaurant lease, is hereby waived by
   Franchisor.

        For purposed of this Addendum, a "Direct Competitor" of Franchisor
   shall mean a person, firm, corporation or other entity which operates a
   chain of three (3) or more restaurants that are upscale, with moderately
   priced menu items, that serves alcoholic beverages, and that has a menu
   and/or method of operation substantially similar to Franchisor's menu and
   method of operation and which competitor operates its restaurants within
   the continental United States.

        Developer shall notify Franchisor of any proposed sale and within
   fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice Franchisor will notify
   Developer whether Franchisor has determined the third-party purchaser to
   be a Direct Competitor.  If Franchisor determines that said third-party
   purchaser is not a Direct Competitor and said third-party purchaser is
   approved by Franchisor as a new franchisee in the manner and in the time
   period provided in the Development and Franchise Agreements, Franchisor
   shall have no right to purchase said Restaurant or take an assignment of
   such lease as a result of the options granted it in Article 19 of the
   Franchise Agreement.  Alternatively, if Franchisor determines that the
   third-party purchaser is a Direct Competitor as hereinbefore provided, or
   does not approve said third-party purchaser as a new franchisee, the
   provisions of Article 19 shall apply, unaffected by the terms of this
   Second Addendum.  In all other respects, except as set forth in the other
   Addenda to this Development Agreement, the Development Agreement and form
   Franchise Agreement shall remain unaffected by the terms hereof.

        3.   Franchisor acknowledges that the Marcus Corporation, the
   principal shareholder of the Developer, is not a party to the Development
   Agreement, nor any Franchise Agreement to be entered pursuant to the terms
   of said Development Agreement.  Accordingly, any reference to obligations,
   responsibilities, guarantees or liabilities of the Marcus Corporation
   referred to in the Development Agreement, Franchise Agreement or Addenda
   thereto is hereby eliminated.

        4.   This Second Addendum shall amend each and every Franchise
   Agreement entered between the parties pursuant to the Development
   Agreement now and in the future without the necessity of referring hereto
   in those agreements.  This Second Addendum may be amended by the parties
   hereto only by a written instrument specifically referring to this Second
   Addendum.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Second
   Addendum to Development Agreement the day and year first above written.

   following Subsection 9.4 and shall be considered an integral part of the
   Development Agreement:

             9.5  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
        this Agreement, if any provisions of this Section 9, governing

        Section 9 as may remain otherwise enforceable, and the latter
        shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the
