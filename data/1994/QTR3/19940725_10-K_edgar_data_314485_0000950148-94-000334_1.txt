ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

(A)  GENERAL

        Commonwealth Equity Trust ("Trust") was formed as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") on July 31, 1973 for the primary purpose of
acquiring, owning and financing real property and mortgage investments.  The
Trust provides investors with the opportunity to own, through transferable
shares, an interest in diversified real estate investments.  The Trust invested
primarily in income-producing real property (as opposed to property investments
acquired primarily for possible capital gain) and in loans secured by mortgages
on real property in accordance with investment objectives and policies.  Most
of the investments in mortgage loans were in connection with the disposition of
The Trust's real properties.  In addition, the Trust also acquired unimproved
real property with little current income for the propose of constructing
buildings or other improvements thereon or for capital appreciation.

        Through these investments, The Trust has provided investors with the
opportunity to participate in a portfolio of professionally managed real estate
assets in much the same way that a mutual fund affords investors an opportunity
to invest in a professionally managed portfolio of stocks, bonds and other
securities.  A REIT is not, however, a mutual fund, and is not subject to the
same regulations as a mutual fund.

        In 1977, the Trust elected to be and was taxed as a REIT through the
year ended September 30, 1992.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified
REIT is relieved, in part, of federal income taxes on ordinary income and
capital gains distributed to shareholders.  State tax benefits may also accrue
to a qualified REIT.  The Trust maintained a general policy of distributing
cash to its shareholders that approximated taxable income plus noncash charges
such as depreciated and amortization.  As a result, distributions to
shareholders often exceeded cumulative net income.

        During the year ended September 30, 1993, the Trust did not qualify to
be taxed as a REIT.  The termination of its REIT status will be effective as of
the beginning of that fiscal year.  Furthermore, the circumstances of that
termination were such that it is unlikely that the Trust will be eligible to
re-elect to be taxed as a REIT prior to its taxable year ending September 30,
1998.

         The Trust operates pursuant to a Declaration of Trust which sets forth
the powers of the Board of Trustees with regard to management and investment
activities of the Trust.  The Declaration of Trust gives the Board of Trustees
the power to borrow money on the Trust's behalf; to make loans to other
persons; to invest in the securities of other issuers under certain
circumstances; to make investments in property; to purchase outstanding shares
of the Trust for such consideration as they deem advisable; to issue an annual
report to shareholders; to issue debt securities;  to allocate investments
between direct and indirect ownership; and to exercise other powers in
connection with the Trust's operation.  Pursuant to the Declaration of Trust,
the Trustees make decisions regarding the Trust's investment and sales
activities without the prior approval of shareholders.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS

         CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS.  On August 2, 1993, the Trust filed a petition
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.  The
bankruptcy case is currently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Eastern District of California, Sacramento Division and is entitled In re
Commonwealth Equity Trust Case No. 93-26727-C-11.  The proximate cause of the
Trust's filing a petition for reorganization was its falling out of compliance
with a restructuring agreement entered into on July 17, 1992 with a lender
group for which Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company ("Pacific Mutual
Lenders") acted as agent.

         The Trust was unable to meet payment dates on the Pacific Mutual
Lenders' restructured debt.  The Pacific Mutual Lenders noticed the Trust's
default, but attempted to negotiate a further restructuring and resolve claims
by the Trust against the Pacific Mutual Lenders.  Finally, on August 2, 1993,
the Trust filed its petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U. S.
Bankruptcy Code.

         In September 1993 the United States Trustee ("UST") appointed an
Official Committee of Holders of Equity Interests ("Equity Holders Committee")
and an Official Committee of Creditors Holding Unsecured Claims ("Creditors
Committee").  Both the Equity Holders Committee and the Creditors Committee
have undertaken significant involvement in many aspects of the Chapter 11 case,
including evaluation of the Trust's business operations and of reorganization
alternatives.

         On March 30, 1994, the Trust filed with the Court a Plan of
Reorganization and Disclosure Statement.  Thereafter, there were a number of
further discussions and negotiations between the Trust and the Pacific Mutual
Lenders regarding settlement.  On May 13, 1994, the Trust, together with the
Equity Holders' Committee and the Pacific Mutual Lenders (collectively,
together with the Trust, the "Plan Proponents") filed with the Court a First
Amended Plan of Reorganization and a Disclosure Statement with respect thereto.

<PAGE>   6
July 21, 1994

        On June 3, 1994, the Plan Proponents filed with the Court a Second
Amended Plan of Reorganization and a Disclosure Statement with respect thereto. 
On June 9, 1994, the Plan Proponents and the Creditors Committee as an
additional proponent filed with the Court a Third Amended Plan and related
Disclosure Statement.  The Third Amended Plan provided for, inter alia: (a) the
restructuring of virtually all of the Trust's secured and unsecured debt; (b)
the reduction in the number of Common Shares held by current shareholders from
approximately 25,100,000 shares to approximately 2,450,000 shares (effectively,
a reverse stock split); and the issuance of approximately 2,550,000 new Common
Shares, as well as a new class of Preferred Shares, of the Trust to the Pacific
Mutual Lenders.  After the restructuring, the Pacific Mutual Lenders will own a
majority of the new Common Shares.

        The Disclosure Statement was approved by the Court after a hearing on
June 8 and 9, 1994.  The Disclosure Statement was mailed to the Trust's
creditors and equity security holders on or about June 21, 1994, with ballots
to be returned by July 18, 1994.  A hearing to confirm the Plan is tentatively
scheduled from July 27 through August 8, 1994.

        EFFECT OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ON DISPOSITIONS.  Overall recessionary
factors and depressed conditions in the real estate industry, which result in
part from the contraction of available financing to the commercial real estate
industry, have restricted the Trust's ability to generate liquidity through the
sale of its properties because potential buyers have been unable to obtain the
necessary financing to consummate transactions.

        VALUATION LOSSES.  The Trust recorded $53,089,000 in 1993 as an
allowance for possible investment losses.  The valuation loss provision was
recorded based on appraisals and management's estimate of net realizable values
of certain real properties owned by the Trust, notes receivable secured by real
properties and Partnership interests, and after consideration of various market
factors adversely affecting real estate at the present time, particularly the
lack of credit available to purchasers of commercial real estate and overbuilt
commercial real estate markets.  Gain or loss will be recorded in the future to
the extent that amounts realized from sale of these properties differ from the
appraised or estimated net realizable values.  See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

        Since its inception in 1973, the Trust has sought to acquire a
diversified portfolio of income producing real property and mortgage
investments (as opposed to investment acquired primarily for possible capital
gain), primarily in California.  The Trust does not intend to actively invest
additional significant amounts at the present time.  It is anticipated that the
terms of the new notes to be issued to the Pacific Mutual Lenders will severely
limit the Trust's ability to make acquisitions.  However, the Trust will
continue to make investment to the extent necessary to preserve or to develop
existing assets, including acquisitions and dispositions to provide additional
diversity, flexibility and liquidity to the portfolio.  To the extent that the
Trust continues to invest, the Declaration of Trust grants broad discretion to
the Trustees to allocate the Trust's assets without prior approval of
shareholders between real property (both improved and unimproved) and mortgage
loans and between direct and indirect ownership interest.

         During the last three fiscal years, the following sources have 
contributed to the Trust's total income:

</TABLE>


         The Declaration of Trust permits the Trust to leverage its
investments, that is, the Trust may finance or refinance its properties by
borrowings. The level of leverage of the Trust at September 30, 1993, which
level will likely change as a result of the Chapter 11 Case, is 1 to 1.

         The Trust generally has made significant cash investments in any
properties it acquires.  Historically, the Trust has invested primarily in
properties which show income in excess of expenses.  During the last several
years, the ability of the Trust's properties to produce positive cash flow has
been negatively impacted by the current economic downturn.

         The real estate market is highly competitive.  Although the Trust is
not currently competing for investment opportunities, the pool of available
financing for real estate investments has diminished and the Trust competes for
such financing with an indeterminate number of individuals, both foreign and
domestic, including other REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds, trust
funds and private sources of investment capital.


(C)  SELECTION, MANAGEMENT AND CUSTODY OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS.

         The Declaration of Trust authorized the Trustees to seek advice from
time to time on the values and suitability of prospective investments and
dispositions.

         The Trust's management at the time of its bankruptcy filing was
subject to considerable controversy and dispute.  The Trust filed an
application (the "B&B Employment Application") seeking authority to employ its
prepetition advisor and property manager, B&B I and B&B II, respectively.  The
UST and the Pacific Mutual Lenders, among others, raised numerous questions
regarding the employment and compensation of B&B I and B&B II in the Chapter 11
Case, which objections were scheduled for a hearing and cross-examination
testimony.  Following numerous and lengthy discussions with the UST, in
particular, as well as other parties, regarding the Trust's post-petition
operations and management, the Trust withdrew the B&B Employment Application.

         For two decades the Trust had no employees and managed and operated
its properties through outside entities.  Pursuant to a consensual agreement
with the UST, the Trust won court approval of and implemented a sweeping change
in its management structure.  In October 1993, the Trust changed to a
self-administration management structure.  This involved:

<PAGE>   8
July 21, 1994

         1.      Hiring a number of employees of B&B I and B&B II who were
knowledgeable regarding the Trust's properties, operations and financial
affairs;

         2.      Expanding the duties of Doris Alexis, chairperson of the
Trust's Board of Trustees, including significantly enlarging her day to day
responsibilities and involvement;

         3.      Other management and administration changes, including changes
in responsibilities; physical relocation of personnel, records and equipment;
activation of new telephone numbers; computer system realignments; and
construction of walls physically segregating remaining B&B I and B&B II
personnel pending the relocation of B&B I and B&B II;

         4.      Engaging in arranging and negotiating the relicensing of the
Trust's hotel operations and the proposed terms of continued affiliation with
national hotel franchisors who had previously dealt directly with B&B I and B&B
II and related outside management companies; and

         5.      Formulating and implementing plans for realignment of the
Trust's property lease-up and property management functions, including
parameters for use of in-house brokers and outside tenant brokers.


         NEW CEO.  An additional change in the Trust management was implemented
in March, 1994, when the Trust hired Frank A. Morrow, through his corporation
FAMA Management, Inc. as chief executive officer pending Bankruptcy Court
approval of a services and confidentiality agreement, which agreement was
approved by the Court following a hearing held on March 31, 1994.  Mr. Morrow
was not previously affiliated with the Trust, but has a range of real estate
and management experience, having served as Director of Real Estate for
Stanford University, Senior Vice President/Regional Manager of Bedford
Properties, Senior Vice President of Boise Cascade Urban Development
Corporation and Assistant to the Chairman for Hawaiian Airlines, among other
experience.  As CEO, he will exercise "hands-on" oversight of business
operations and advise the Board of Trustees.  The term of the agreement is from
March 8, 1994 through September 30, 1994, subject to the Trust's right to
terminate upon thirty (30) days advance notice.

         NEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY.  The Trust has searched for and
obtained the services of a property management company to assist in the
management of the Trust's commercial real estate portfolio.  On June 15, 1994
the court approved the contract for services with United Property Services.


(D)  OTHER INFORMATION

         During its last three fiscal years, the Trust has been involved in
only one industry segment: the acquisition, operation and holding for
investment of income producing real properties, the making of loans secured by
real property and improvements in connection with those activities.  Revenues,
net income and assets concerning this industry segment are set forth in the
Trust's financial statements.

         The rules and regulations adopted by various agencies of federal,
state or local government relating to environmental controls in the development
and operation of real property may operate to reduce the number of available
investment opportunities or may adversely affect existing properties.  While
the Trust does not believe that environmental controls have had a material
impact on its activities to date, there can be no assurance that the Trust will
not be adversely affected in the future.

         The Trust does not engage in research and development activities nor
is it involved in any foreign operations.  The Trust does not derive income
from foreign sources.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


         At the time its Chapter 11 petition was filed in August 1993, the
Trust was party to a number of lawsuits.  Most involved ordinary disputes
common to the real property management business, and amounts immaterial to the
Trust's overall financial condition.  In addition, the Trust was party to the
lawsuits described below.

         SHAREHOLDER B&B LITIGATION.  In December, 1991, the Trust received
notice of a pending action (the "Luebkeman Litigation") filed by a shareholder
in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento
("Sacramento Superior Court") and seeking to maintain (a) a class action on
behalf of all shareholders, and (b) a derivative action on the Trust's behalf.
The action named as defendants B&B II, the individual Trustees of the Trust,
and Merrill Lynch Business, Brokerage and Valuation, Inc.  The Trust was named
as a nominal defendant.  The action sought, among other things, a declaration
that the Trust's management agreement with B&B II was invalid; imposition of a
constructive trust on and recovery of $7,195,000 received by B&B II in
December, 1989, in connection with the Second Amendment to the B&B Management
Agreement; attorneys' fees, costs of suit; and other damages according to
proof.  The Trust appointed a committee of independent Trustees who are not
defendants to engage counsel to represent the Trust's interests in the action.

         On April 30, 1992, the Sacramento Superior Court sustained the
defendants' demurrer to the class action causes of action, but authorized the
plaintiffs to proceed with the case as a derivative action.  The Sacramento
Superior Court also ruled that, in light of the terms of the Declaration of
Trust, the Trustees would no be held liable to the Trust based upon simple
negligence.

         On July 16, 1992, the Sacramento Superior Court sustained the
defendants' demurrer to the derivative action, with leave to amend.  This
ruling was based on the plaintiffs' failure to make demand on the Trustees to
take the action requested in the complaint or to allege with sufficient
particularity the reasons why such a demand would be futile.  The Sacramento
Superior Court also stayed the action for all other purposes for 60 days,
except to allow plaintiffs to amend their complaint.

         On March 30, 1993, the plaintiffs filed and served a second amended
complaint, which names as additional defendants Joyce Berger and the law firm
of Nossaman, Guthner, Knox and Elliott.  Upon dissolution of the stay, the
parties actively engaged in settlement negotiations.  Prior to bankruptcy,
settlement negotiations were progressing toward a payment to the Trust of over
$1 million.  Since the bankruptcy and the involvement of creditor
constituencies, the parties have sought to broaden negotiations to encompass a
global settlement of disputes involving the B&B entities.  If Lubekeman is not
settled, the current plaintiffs' counsel will continue prosecution of the
action on a contingency fee basis.  Due to settlement negotiations, there has
been little discovery and, therefore, the likelihood of success on the merits
is uncertain.

         FORMER SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION.  On April 27, 1993, the Trust received
notice that it had been named as a defendant in a complaint filed in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California (the "Aizuss
Action").  The complaint was filed by about 130 former Commonwealth Equity
Trust shareholders and named defendants the Trust, current and former Trustees,
B&B II and its shareholders, and various current and former professional
advisors and consultants to the Trust.  The plaintiffs allege breach of
fiduciary duty, violation of federal and state securities laws, violation of
civil RICO, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence and civil
conspiracy.  The non-Debtor defendants to this litigation filed a motion to
dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint and a request for sanctions.  The district
court granted the motion, and assessed sanctions against the plaintiffs'
attorneys.  Subsequently, pursuant to a stipulation by and between the Trust
and the plaintiffs, the action was dismissed without prejudice as to the Trust.



ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         No annual meeting of the Trust's shareholders was held during 1993.
No matters were put to a vote of the shareholders.

                                    PART II



ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SECURITY HOLDER
         MATTERS


         The Trust has one class of authorized and outstanding equity
consisting of common shares of beneficial interest, par value $1.00 per share.

Historical Pricing of and Market for Shares

         From its inception through April 4, 1982, the Trust sold its shares at
$10 per share regardless of the value of its investment portfolio.  The equity
interests in real estate owned by the Trust are carried on its financial
statements at the lower of (a) cost less accumulated depreciation, or (b) net
realizable value, rather than at current fair market values.  Accordingly, any
increase or decrease in portfolio value is reflected in the Trust's financial
statements only upon the sale of a property or upon a determination by the
Trust that the value of a property has been impaired by economic circumstances.
Historically, the Trustees from time to time adjusted the offering price of the
Trust's shares to reflect appreciation of the Trust's portfolio.  The first
such adjustment was made on April 4, 1982, when the price per share was raised
to $11.50.  On June 9, 1983, the Trustees revalued the Trust portfolio, raising
the price per share to $12.00.

         There is no established market for the Trust's Shares.  From July 1973
until July 5, 1989, the Trust engaged in a continuous intrastate offering of
its securities pursuant to permits issued by the California Commissioner of
Corporations.  In May 1989, the Trust advised its shareholders that (a) the
offering would terminate as of July 5, 1989 and (b) shareholders desiring to
purchase or sell shares pursuant to the "crossing" arrangement described below
would have to submit their purchase orders or shares prior to that date.
Although the shares of the Trust are not traded on any exchange or on the
NASDAQ System, several registered broker-dealers from time to time have matched
orders to purchase and sell outstanding shares.

Status of Liquidation

         The Trust terminated the continuous offering and the crossing
arrangement effective July 5, 1989.  The Trust determined that it would arrange
for the purchase at $10.80 per share ($12 per share less commissions) of all
shares properly submitted to the designated crossing agent prior to the
termination date.  To the extent that account "liquidation" requests could not
be matched  with new purchase orders, the Board of Trustees authorized
redemption of the shares by the Trust using proceeds from the sale of shares
from January 1, 1989 to the termination date to fund the redemption.  At June
30, 1994, 29,691 shares, had been tendered and not redeemed.  Holders of these
shares will receive the same treatment as all other shareholders under the
Amended Plan of Reorganization.

Distributions

         Until recent years, it was the Trust's policy to declare quarterly
distributions and to declare special distributions from time to time, usually
to distribute gains realized on the sale or refinancing of Trust property.
Because of the financial difficulties, the Trust made only one distribution
during fiscal 1991 ($.20 per share on October 3, 1990) and no distributions
during 1992 or 1993.

         It is not anticipated that any distributions will be made in the
foreseable future.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."

         At June 30, 1994, there were 28,832 shareholders of record of the
Trust.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


         CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY.  The Trust anticipates that its
principal source of funds during 1994 will be operating income.  Because the
Trust will be under the protection of Chapter 11 during the year, the payment
of certain liabilities has been stayed.  It is a condition to confirmation of
the Amended Plan, that the Trust obtain a working capital loan of approximately
ten million dollars to meet capital needs in excess of available income.
However, capital resources and the amount and timing of Trust liabilities
cannot be finally determined until the status of the Amended Plan is finally
determined.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1993 vs. 1992

         Results of operations for 1993 were affected principally by the
continuing downturn in the general economy, as reflected in the commercial real
estate market, through California and Arizona and especially in Southern
California.

         Approximately 74% of the year's net loss was effected by the total
valuation loss of $53,089,000, as applied to the Trust's real properties, notes
receivable and partnership interests.  The provision for valuation loss
reflects recent independent appraisals and managements's estimates of net
realizable value on the Trust's real properties, notes receivable secured by
real properties and partnership interests compared with book value.  Factors
considered include increased capitalization rates, decreased rental rates and
decreased occupancy rates for many of the Trust's properties.

         The largest valuation losses recorded against real properties
aggregated $25,183,000 on the following properties: Redding Park Holiday Inn
(Redding, CA), Pacific Palisades Office Building (Pacific Palisades, CA),
Sacramento Holiday Inn (Sacramento, CA), Chico Holiday Inn (Chico, CA), Town
Center Garden Office Park (Long Beach, CA) Trade Center A (Rancho Cordova, CA),
Florin Perkins land (Sacramento, CA), Parthenia land (Northridge, CA) and Casa
Grande Motor Inn (Arroyo Grande, CA).

         The largest valuation loss recorded against notes receivable
collateralized by real properties was $2,400,000 on a note secured by
Southcoast Commerce (Fountain Valley, CA).

         Total valuation losses of $12,472,000 were recorded against the
Trust's partnership interest in CR Properties and Placer Ranch Partners.  CR
Properties, which interest has been written down to zero, is a limited partner
in Sacramento Renaissance, a limited partnership, which owns the Renaissance
Tower office building (Sacramento, CA).  The independent appraisal has
determined that the value of the property does not exceed the related debts.
Placer Ranch Partners' indirectly owned land has been written down to its value
as agricultural land, as development of the property is not ascertained at this
point.

         Gain or loss will be recorded in the future to the extent that amounts





                                          13
<PAGE>   17
July 21, 1994

realized from the sale of these assets differ from the appraised or estimated
net realizable values.  In the event economic conditions for real estate
continue to decline, additional valuation losses will be recognized.  Losses
and gains are realized only on the sale of the underlying assets.

         From August 2, 1993 through September 30, 1993, the Trust operated as
debtor-in-possession and incurred net reorganization expenses of $679,000.  For
the year total revenues (excluding reorganized revenue items, which equaled
$27,000 or 0.1% of prior year's revenue) decreased by 14.9%.  Rental revenues
declined by $2,862,000 (10.4%), and interest income declined by $1,809,000
(46.7%).

         Total expenses (excluding reorganization expense items, which equaled
$706,000 or 1.6% of prior year's expenses) decreased by $3,772,000 (8.7%) from
1992 to 1993.

         Loss on foreclosure or sale of investments totaled $7,130,000 and
reflects net loss derived from the sale of Pavilions, 20 Bicentennial Drive,
Denny's, Florin/Perkins, Dunlap, Northern, Park West, Sizzler, West Southern,
Corona and six notes receivable and the foreclosure of Howe Avenue & Cottage
Way, Arbor Plaza, Huntington and Hookston Square.

1992 vs. 1991

         Results of operations for 1992 were affected principally by the
continuing downturn in the general economy, as reflected in the commercial real
estate market, throughout California and Arizona and especially in Southern
California.

         Although the net loss during the year was attributable in part to
decreased revenues, as discussed below, the bulk of the net loss results from
$48,130,000 in valuation losses relating to the Trust's real properties, notes
receivable and partnership interests.  The provision for valuation loss
reflects recent independent appraisals and management's estimates of net
realizable value on the Trust's real properties, notes receivable secured by
real properties and partnership interests compared with book value.  Factors
considered include increased capitalization rates, decreased rental rates and
decreased occupancy rates for many of the Trust's real properties.  The most
extreme valuation reserves were recorded against real properties and notes
receivable collateralized by real properties located in Southern California and
Arizona including Town Center, Villa Del Sol, Imperial Canyon and Southcoast
Commerce Center, which together accounted for $14,138,000 of total valuation
writedowns.  Properties located in Sacramento were not immune from the
continuing impact of the economy on commercial real estate.  A provision from
valuation loss of $4,957,000 was made against the Trust's investment in CR
Properties (formerly CET/RJB), a limited partner in Sacramento Renaissance,
owner of the Renaissance Towers property, reflecting substantial loans for
tenant improvements and other leasing and marketing expenses made to Sacramento
Renaissance by its general partner which must be repaid before returns are paid
to the Trust.  A valuation allowance of $1,910,000 was recorded as to the
Florin Perkins lots reflecting the decrease in the value of raw land and
reduced prospects for development over the medium term.  Writedowns on thirteen
additional properties located in the Sacramento area accounted for $7,592,000
of the allowance.

<PAGE>   18
July 21, 1994

         In addition to valuation reserves, total revenues decreased $3,242,000
(9.4%) in 1992 as compared with 1991.  While aggregate interest income remained
relatively unchanged, rental revenues decreased $3,329,000 (10.8%) reflecting
sale of four properties during 1992 and disposition of an additional property
by voluntary foreclosure.  In addition, the Trust experienced a substantial
decrease in aggregate rental revenue of $708,000 at Imperial Canyon, Arbor
Plaza and 515 S. Fair Oaks Avenue, all properties located in Southern
California as a result of greater vacancy and lower lease renewal rates.  The
Trust's rental income relating to its hotel properties also reflected a
$1,200,000 decrease as a result of partial closures and reduced occupancy
during renovations required by the franchisor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
several Trust properties showed increased revenues during 1992 including Totem
Square, with increased revenues of $300,000 and higher occupancy rates, the
Fulton Square, a property acquired in 1991 which accounted for $375,000 in
increased rental income.

         Total expenses increased by $828,000 (2%) from 1991 to 1992.  While
property management and depreciation and amortization expense decreased by
$179,000 (10.4%) and $1,527,000 (15.2%), respectively, reflecting property
dispositions during the year, general and administrative expenses showed an
increase of $2,817,000 (90.4%).  The increase resulted principally from (i)
$1,000,000 in professional services (including lender legal fees, appraisal
costs and accounting fees) related to restructuring of the Trust's debt with
its Senior Lenders and (ii) $1,100,000 in legal fees and costs arising from the
shareholder litigation described in Item 3 of this report and in fees incurred
by the Trust in the restructuring of debt with the Senior Lenders.  The
increase in general and administrative expense also reflects fees for
consultants to the Independent Trustees.

         Net gain on sale of rental properties totalling $539,000 reflects net
gain derived from the sale of F Street Professional Building, 190 Otis, 1227
Chester Avenue and Fountain View Office Plaza.

1991 vs. 1990

         Results of operations in 1991 showed the impact of overall
recessionary factors and highly competitive market conditions in many real
estate markets.

         Rental revenue decreased $1,777,000 (5.5%) in 1991 as compared with
1990.  Two-thirds of the decrease is attributable to property sales in 1990 and
1991.  In addition, properties held by the Trust during both 1991 and 1990
generally showed lower revenues in 1991, accounting for one-third of the total
decrease in rental revenues.  Lower average note receivable balances in 1991
led to a decrease of $1,999,000 (34.6%) in interest revenue from the 1990
level.  The lower balances were a result of collections, sale of participation
interests and conversion of a note into a partnership interest.  Overall,
revenues decreased $3,776,000 (9.8%) in 1991 as compared with 1990.

         Expenses increased 1.6% in 1991 as compared with 1990.  Decreases in
property management and general and administrative expenses of $312,000 (15.4%)
and $788,000 (20.2%), respectively, resulting from property sales were offset
by increases in depreciation and amortization of $958,000 (10.5%) and in
interest expense of $788,000 (4.7%).  The increased depreciation and
amortization reflects amortization for a full twelve month period in 1991 (as
compared with a partial year in 1990) of the $7,195,000 paid to the Adviser in
connection with the Second Amendment to Management Agreement, as discussed
above.  Increased interest expense reflects higher average note payable
balances outstanding in 1991 as compared with 1990.

<PAGE>   19
July 21, 1994

         Shareholder's equity was $138,559,000 at September 30, 1991 compared
with $180,946,000 at September 30, 1990.  The decrease from 1990 to 1991 was
the result of the net loss incurred in 1991, the October 1990 distribution to
shareholders and the Trust's repurchase in 1991 of shares submitted for
redemption prior to termination of the Trust's offering on July 5, 1989.

         The bulk of the loss results from provision for valuation losses of
$28,298,000 recorded in 1991.  The provision reflects the Trust's estimation of
the net realizable values of its real estate investments as compared with the
book value of such investments.  The valuation loss provision was recorded
after consideration of various market factors adversely affecting real estate
at the present time.  particularly the lack of credit available to purchasers
of commercial real estate and overbuilt and overinvested commercial real estate
markets.  Thus, $12,800,000 of the valuation losses arise from properties owned
in the Phoenix metropolitan area, which has experienced a lengthy period of
oversaturation of retail and office properties.  An additional $14,800,000 of
the valuation losses relate to hotel properties and reflect increased
competition arising from a general overinvestment in the hotel industry by
developers and banks during the latter part of the 1980's.  Gain or loss will
be recorded in the future to the extent that amounts realized from sale of
these properties differ from the estimated net realizable values.  Losses and
gains are realized only on sale of the underlying real property.

         Net gain on sale of rental properties totalling $203,000 reflects net
gain derived from the sale of 87 Scripps Drive, El Torito, National University
and Vacation Special Apartments.  The decrease in gain from 1990 reflects the
continued slowdown in the commercial real estate market; current economic
conditions have severely restricted credit availability to prospective buyers
of Trust properties.

         IMPACT OF INFLATION.  The effect of inflation on the Trust's
operations and properties is varied.  Revenues have not recently been affected
by inflation as highly competitive market conditions have prevented increases
in rental rates for most of the Trust's properties and, in some cases, have
caused rental rates to decrease.  Although operating expenses are impacted by
inflation, inflation related increases in operating expenses have not been
material during the past year.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
         FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

         (a)     As of November 3, 1993, KPMG Peat Marwick was terminated as
the Trust's independent accountant.  The Trust's financial statements for its
fiscal year ended September 30, 1992 contained a report of KPMG Peat Marwick
which included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about the
Trust's ability to continue as a going concern because of the Trust's recurring
losses, non-compliance with certain loan covenants and significant loan
repayments due in fiscal 1993 on its long term notes payable.  Similarly, the
Trust's financial statements for its fiscal year ended September 30, 1991
contained a report of KPMG Peat Marwick which included an explanatory paragraph
regarding substantial doubt about the Trust's ability to continue as a going
concern because of the Trust's recurring losses, non- compliance with certain
loan covenants and significant loan repayments due in fiscal 1992 under its
bank debt and debenture agreements.

         The Board of Trustees of the Trust decided to solicit bids from
independent accountants, including KPMG Peat Marwick, for accounting services
to be provided to the Trust.  KPMG Peat Marwick submitted a bid but was not the
winning bidder and thus has been terminated.  The winning bidder was Coopers &
Lybrand.  The decision to change independent accountants was approved by the
Board of Trustees.

         During the two most recent fiscal years preceding KPMG Peat Marwick's
termination, there were no disagreements with KPMG Peat Marwick on any matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure, which would have caused it to make a reference to
the subject

matter of the disagreement in connection with its report.  Furthermore, there
were no reportable events during the two most recent fiscal years preceding
KPMG Peat Marwick's termination arising from KPMG Peat Marwick having advised
the company (a) that the internal controls necessary for the Trust to develop
reliable financial statements did not exist; (b) that information had come to
its attention that led it to no longer be able to rely on management's
representations or that made it unwilling to be associated with financial
statements prepared by management; (c) (1) of the need to expand significantly
the scope of its audit or that information had come to its attention that if
further investigated might either (i) materially impact the fairness or
reliability of a previously issued audit report or underlying financial
statements or the financial statements issued or to be issued to cover the
fiscal period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements
covered by an audit report or (ii) cause it to be unwilling to rely on
management's representations or be associated with the Trust's financial
statements and (2) due to KPMG Peat Marwick's termination, it did not so expand
the scope of its audit or conduct such further investigations; and (d) (1)
information had come to its attention that it concluded materially impacts the
fairness or reliability of either (i) a previously issued audit report or the
underlying financial statements, (ii) the financial statements issued or to be
issued covering the fiscal period subsequent to the date of the most recent
financial statement covered by an audit report (including information that,
unless resolved to its satisfaction, would prevent it from rendering an
unqualified audit report on those financial statements) and (2) due to KPMG
Peat Marwick's termination, the issue has not been resolved to its satisfaction
prior to its termination.

         (e)     Coopers & Lybrand was appointed by the Board of Trustees as
the new independent accountant for the Trust effective November 3, 1993.
During the Trust's two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim
period prior to KPMG Peat Marwick's termination, the Trust did not consult with
Coopers & Lybrand regarding the application of accounting principles to a
specified transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on
the Trust's financial statements.

                          Independent Auditors' Report




The Board of Trustees
Commonwealth Equity Trust


We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Commonwealth Equity Trust and
Affiliates (Trust) as of September 30, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for
the year then ended.  In connection with our audit of the consolidated
financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedules as
listed in the accompanying index for the year ended September 30, 1993.  These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Trust's management.   Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audit.   The consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules of the Trust for the years ended September 30,
1992 and 1991, were audited by other auditors, whose report dated February 5,
1993, on those statements included an explanatory paragraph that described
substantial doubt about the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern,
which is discussed in Note 14 to those financial statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.   An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Commonwealth Equity Trust and Affiliates at September 30, 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Trust will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Notes 1 and
13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Trust's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings and related litigation raise substantial doubt about the Trust's
ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's Plan of Reorganization
and Disclosure Statement that have been submitted to the Court is described in
Note 1, which includes the Equity Security Holders' Committee and the Pacific
Mutual Lenders as coproponents.  The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Trustees
Commonwealth Equity Trust:


We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Commonwealth Equity Trust
and affiliates as of September 30, 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of loss, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 1992. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the,
financial statement schedules for the periods ended September 30, 1992.  These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Trust's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Commonwealth Equity
Trust and affiliates at September 30, 1992, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
September 30, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Trust will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 14 to
the financial statements, the Trust's recurring losses, noncompliance with
certain loan covenants and significant loan repayments due in fiscal 1993 on
its long-term notes payable, raise substantial doubt about the Trust's ability
to continue as a going concern, Management's plans in regards to these matters
are also described in Note 14.  The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.     Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Chapter 11
       Proceedings:

                                  Organization

       Commonwealth Equity Trust (the Trust) was organized under the laws of
       the State of California pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated July
       31, 1973.  From July 1973 until July 1989, the Trust engaged in a
       continuous intrastate offering of its securities pursuant to permits
       issued by the California Department of Corporations.  Commencing
       September 1, 1993, the Trust became self-administered.

                          Principles of Consolidation

       At September 30, 1993, the consolidated financial statements include the
       accounts of the Trust and its majority-owned affiliates:  3604 Fair Oaks
       Boulevard (3604) and California Real Estate Investment Trust (CalREIT).
       Majority-owned affiliates consist of a general partnership and a real
       estate investment trust engaged in real estate activities in which the
       Trust owns a greater than 50% interest.

              Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 Proceedings

       On August 2, 1993, the Trust filed a petition for reorganization under
       Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.  The bankruptcy case is
       currently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern
       District of California, Sacramento Division and is entitled In re
       Commonwealth Equity Trust, Case No. 93-26727-C-11.  On March 30, 1994,
       the Trust filed with the Court a Plan of Reorganization and Disclosure
       Statement.  On May 13, 1994, the Trust, together with the Equity
       Security Holders' Committee and the Pacific Mutual Lenders
       (collectively, together with the Trust, the "Plan Proponents"), filed
       with the Court a First Amended Plan of Reorganization and a Disclosure
       Statement with Respect to First Amended Plan of Reorganization.

       On June 3, 1994, the Plan Proponents filed with the Court a Second
       Amended Plan of Reorganization and Disclosure Statement with Respect to
       Second Amended Plan of Reorganization.  The Second Amended Plan provides
       for, inter alia:  (a) the restructuring of virtually all of the Trust's
       secured and unsecured debt; (b) the issuance of new common stock of the
       Trust to current equity security holders; (c) the issuance of new common
       stock of the Trust to the Pacific Mutual Lenders; and (d) the issuance
       of preferred stock of the Trust to the Pacific Mutual Lenders and other
       creditors of the Trust will result in a dilution of the current equity.

       Proceedings, continued:

       A hearing to approve the Disclosure Statement is scheduled for June 8,
       1994.  Neither the Disclosure Statement nor the Second Amended Plan will
       be distributed to the Trust's equity security holders and creditors for
       voting until the Court has approved the contents of the Disclosure
       Statement.  Accordingly, both the Second Amended Plan and Disclosure
       Statement are subject to further revisions and modifications.  After the
       Disclosure Statement is approved, the Trust will transmit same to the
       Trust's creditors and equity security holders for voting and request
       that the Court confirm the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the
       United States Bankruptcy Code.

       On July 17, 1992, the Trust completed a restructuring of $78,445,000 in
       unsecured obligations (see Note 9).  The terms of the restructuring
       agreement allowed for an extension of maturity dates for 5 1/2 years,
       provided that certain conditions were met.  Pursuant to the agreement,
       if these conditions were not met, new secured notes (bearing interest at
       9.5%) came due as follows:  $3,445,000 on December 31, 1992; $2,500,000
       on March 31, 1993, and $72,600,000 on June 30, 1993.  The Trust
       defaulted under the terms of the restructuring agreement and was unable
       to meet its payment dates.  After attempting to negotiate a further
       restructuring, the Trust filed the aforementioned petition for
       reorganization.

       In the Trust's Chapter 11 case, all litigation and claims against the
       Trust at the date of filing were automatically stayed, and the Trust
       continues business operations as a debtor-in-possession.  (See Note 8
       for a description of debt in process of foreclosure and other matters).
       The Bankruptcy Code prohibits creditors who are subject to the
       jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court from attempting to collect their
       pre-petition debts from the Trust, either by commencement or
       continuation of a lawsuit or otherwise, unless the Bankruptcy terminates
       or modifies the stay.

       During the Chapter 11 proceedings, interest expense is recorded at
       contractually stated amounts as the related debt is not in excess of
       aggregate assets.

       Neither of the Trust's majority owned affiliates, 3604 or CalREIT, filed
       for protection under Chapter 11.  However, 3604 is under a court
       appointed receiver.

       Proceedings, continued:
       
                             Partnership Interests

       Partnership investments of 20% to 50% are accounted for by the equity
       method.  Under this method, the investments are recorded at initial cost
       and increased for partnership income and decreased for partnership
       losses and distributions.

       During the year ended September 30, 1990, the Trust entered into Placer
       Ranch Partners, a limited partnership in which the Trust owns a 31%
       interest.  CR Properties, formerly CET/RJB, is a general partnership, in
       which the Trust owns a 50% interest.

                                  Income Taxes

       In 1977, the Trust elected to be and was taxed as a real estate
       investment trust (REIT) through the year ended September 30, 1992.  A
       REIT is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is
       distributed to shareholders, provided that at least 95% of its real
       estate investment trust taxable income is distributed.

       During the year ended September 30, 1993, the Trust did not qualify to
       be taxed as a REIT.  The termination of its REIT status is effective as
       of October 1, 1992. Furthermore, the circumstances of that termination
       were such that the Trust will not be eligible to re- elect to be taxed
       as a REIT prior to its fifth taxable year which begins after its taxable
       year ended September 30, 1992.

                               Rental Properties

       Rental properties are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
       and less a valuation allowance for possible investment losses.  The
       Trust's valuation allowance for possible investment losses represents
       the excess of the carrying value of individual properties over their
       appraised or estimated net realizable value.

       The additions to the valuation allowance for possible investment losses
       are recorded after consideration of various external factors,
       particularly the lack of credit available to purchasers of real estate
       and overbuilt real estate markets, both of which adversely affect real
       estate.  A gain or loss will be recorded to the extent that the amounts
       ultimately realized from property sales differ from those currently
       estimated.  In the event economic conditions for real estate continue to
       decline, additional valuation losses may be recognized.

1.     Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Chapter 11
       Proceedings, continued:

       The allowance for depreciation and amortization has been calculated
       under the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of
       the properties which range from 30 to 40 years.  Expenditures for
       maintenance, repairs and betterments which do not materially prolong the
       normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred.
       Contract termination costs described in Note 2 have been capitalized as
       a carrying cost of the properties and are being amortized over one to
       four years.

       Real estate acquired by cancellation of indebtedness or foreclosure is
       recorded at current fair market value at the date of acquisition, but
       not in excess of the unpaid balance of the related loan plus costs of
       securing title to and possession of the property.

                                      Cash

       The Trust invests its cash and restricted cash in demand deposits with
       banks with strong credit ratings.  Cash at September 30, 1993, in excess
       of federally insured amounts was $4,951,000.  The Trust has not
       experienced any losses on these deposits.

                Distributions in Excess of Cumulative Net Income

       The Trust, in the past, maintained a general policy of distributing cash
       to its shareholders in an amount that approximated taxable income plus
       noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization.  As a result,
       distributions to shareholders exceeded cumulative net income.

                              Sales of Real Estate

       The Trust complies with the provisions of Statement of Financial
       Accounting Standards No. 66 (SFAS 66), "Accounting for Sales of Real
       Estate."  Accordingly, the recognition of gains on certain transactions
       are deferred until such transactions have complied with the criteria for
       full profit recognition under the Statement.

                      Adoption of Authoritative Statement

       In fiscal 1993, the Trust adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
       Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), "Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial
       Instruments."   This statement requires disclosure of the fair value of
       all financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and
       not recognized in the balance sheet.  The adoption of SFAS 107 resulted
       only in additional disclosure requirements and had no effect on the
       Trust's financial position or results of operations.

                               Net Loss Per Share

       Net loss per share of beneficial interest has been computed based on the
       weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year of
       25,093,000 in 1993, 25,095,000 in 1992 and 25,138,000 in 1991.

                               Reclassifications

       Certain reclassifications have been made in the presentation of the 1992
       and 1991 financial statements to conform to the 1993 presentation.


2.     Related-Party Transactions:

       Until September 1, 1993, administrative services were provided to the
       Trust by B&B Property Investment, Development and Management Company,
       Inc. (B&B).  B&B's compensation consisted of 5% of the gross proceeds
       from the sale of shares of beneficial interest, as well as a
       reimbursement of certain expenses incurred in performing services for
       the Trust.  B&B earned real estate commissions in connection with
       purchases and sales of Trust properties handled by B&B, as well as
       leasing commissions.  The agreement also provided that B&B reimburse the
       Trust for any promotional or annual expenses which exceed the statutory
       allowable limits established by the State of California.

2.     Related-Party Transactions, continued:

       On December 27, 1989, the Trust and B&B terminated the portion of the
       Advisory Agreement relating to CET which granted B&B an exclusive
       authorization to act as a real estate broker in connection with the sale
       of Trust properties owned at August 31, 1989.  In consideration of this
       termination, B&B received $595,000 in cash and two promissory notes
       totalling $6,600,000 which have subsequently been paid.  The $7,195,000
       of consideration was capitalized as a carrying cost of the properties
       and is fully amortized as of September 30, 1993.

       Until September 1, 1993, property management responsibilities of the
       Trust were assigned to B&B Property Investments, Inc. (B&B Property), a
       wholly-owned subsidiary of B&B.  The compensation for property
       management services was negotiated by B&B Property and the Trustees for
       each property when acquired.

       Compensation, leasing commissions and expense reimbursements to B&B and
       B&B Property were $2,826,000, $3,341,000 and $3,330,000 for the years
       ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The commissions
       paid are included in other assets and amortized over the term of the
       leases, typically five years.

       The Trust entered into certain leasing transactions with North Main
       Street Company (North Main), a company owned by the President and
       Chairman of the Board of the Trust's former advisor, B & B.   Until July
       20, 1993, North Main leased the Trust's hotels under triple net leases,
       which leases generated revenue to the Trust of $1,854,000 during the
       year ended September 30, 1993.  Generally such leases provided for
       payment of the greater of a minimum rent or specified percentages of
       preestablished revenue categories as stated in each hotel's lease.   An
       amount of $70,000 was owed by North Main to the Trust as of September
       30, 1992.

       The Trust terminated its lease arrangement with North Main on or about
       July 20, 1993.  North Main has asserted a claim under the Chapter 11
       proceedings against the Trust arising out of that termination, which
       claim the Trust disputes.  In addition, North Main left unpaid certain
       payables in connection with the hotels' operations, for which the Trust
       disputes liability and which may be offset against any North Main claim.

       At September 30, 1993 and 1992, the Trust has amounts due to CalREIT
       aggregating $597,000 and $539,000, respectively.  Such amounts bear
       interest at 10% and are due on demand, without collateral, and are
       eliminated in consolidation.

       During the year ended September 30, 1993, the Trust paid fees of
       $93,000, primarily for consulting, to a company owned by one of the
       Trustees.

3.     Restricted Cash:

       At September 30, 1993 and 1992, cash of $111,000 and $584,000,
       respectively, is restricted under the terms of the agreement with Sun
       Life Insurance Company of America in connection with their purchase of
       senior participation interests in notes receivable (Note 6).


4.     Rental Properties:

       At September 30, 1993 and 1992, the Trust's rental property portfolio at
       cost included office buildings, $86,931,000 and $142,622,000; commercial
       buildings, $83,426,000 and $110,075,000; hotels, $64,787,000 and
       $62,393,000 and land, $8,253,000 and $10,165,000, respectively.

       Noncancellable operating leases at September 30, 1993, provide for
       minimum rental income during each of the next five years of $10,702,000,
       $9,902,000, $8,229,000, $5,876,000 and $4,284,000, respectively, and
       $11,854,000 thereafter.  Certain of the leases increase periodically
       based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.

       In March 1989, the Trust sold its Milpitas, California office building
       for $10,000,000, comprised of a $5,000,000 promissory note
       collateralized by the property and a $5,000,000 credit towards the
       purchase of 680 acres in Roseville, California.  Under the terms of the
       sale agreement, the Trust agreed to lease the entire building for one
       year and received an option to repurchase the property for $5,000,000.
       The transaction was recorded as a financing arrangement for financial
       accounting purposes and no gain or loss was recognized in accordance
       with generally accepted accounting principles.   In August 1990, the
       Trust exercised its option to repurchase the property  for $5,000,000 by
       canceling the $5,000,000 promissory note collateralized by the property.
       For income tax purposes, this transaction was accounted for as a sale
       and subsequent repurchase of $5,000,000.  Based on the different tax and
       financial accounting treatments accorded this transaction, the Trust's
       tax basis in the Milpitas, California office building is $5,000,000 less
       than the financial accounting basis and the tax basis of the 680 acres
       is $5,000,000 more than the financial accounting basis.  In February
       1990, the Trust contributed the 680 acres in Roseville, California to
       Placer Ranch Partners, a limited partnership.

       Rental properties with costs of $9,583,000 are subject to purchase
       options exercisable on the part of the lessees.

5.     Partnership Interests:

       As discussed in Notes 1 and 4, the Trust is a partner in Placer Ranch
       Partners, a limited partnership in which the Trust owns a 31% limited
       partnership interest.  No income has been recognized in the Trust's
       financial statements for 1993, 1992 and 1991 related to the Placer Ranch
       Partners partnership as payment of such income is contingent upon the
       future sale of land.  The following represents an unaudited summary
       balance sheet and operational information of the partnership for the
       years ended September 30:

5.     Partnership Interests, continued:

       The Trust is also a partner in CR Properties, a general partnership, in
       which the Trust owns a 50% interest.  CR Properties is a limited partner
       in a partnership which owns an office building in Sacramento,
       California.  No portion of the CR Properties partnership loss has been
       recognized in the Trust's financial statements for 1993, 1992 and 1991
       as the partnership agreement specifies that net losses shall be
       allocated 100% to the other partner.  As CR Properties has a limited
       partnership interest, it has no contingent liability with respect to the
       office building debt.

6.     Notes Receivable:

       In order to facilitate sales of real estate, the Trust has accepted
       partial payment in the form of notes receivable collateralized by deeds
       of trust.  Additionally, the Trust has invested in a variety of loans
       collateralized by deeds of trust.  As of September 30, 1993 and 1992,
       the Trust had long-term notes receivable, collateralized by deeds of
       trust, of (before valuation allowance and unaccreted discount)
       $27,692,000 and $38,349,000, respectively.  Generally the notes are
       collateralized by real estate properties in California.

       The notes are to be repaid from the cash flow of the property or
       proceeds from the sale or refinancing of the property.  At September 30,
       1993, $2,448,000 of such notes were delinquent.  Contractually scheduled
       principal collections over the next five years, excluding delinquent
       notes, are as follows:  $1,129,000, $2,055,000, $7,349,000, $2,860,000,
       $815,000, respectively, and $11,036,000 thereafter.  The notes bear
       interest at rates ranging from 8% to 13% as of September 30, 1993.  For
       the year ended September 30, 1993, the overall effective rate was 8.2%.

       During the year ended September 30, 1990, the Trust sold $13,753,000 in
       senior participation interests in certain notes receivable to Sun Life
       Insurance Company of America, a Maryland corporation.  The participation
       agreement specifies that upon default of any note receivable covered by
       the agreement, Sun Life will have priority in any proceeds before the
       Trust.  Total participation outstanding at September 30, 1993 and 1992,
       was $1,194,000 and $11,812,000, respectively.

7.     Allowance for Valuation Losses:

       In connection with preparing its plan or reorganization, as described in
       Note 1, the Trust engaged outside professionals to assist in developing
       the plan related to its real estate investments.  Based on this review
       of the real estate investments, the Trust does not expect losses in
       excess of the valuation allowances established.  Adverse economic
       factors, particularly the lack of credit available to purchasers of real
       estate and overbuilt real estate markets resulting in declining lease
       renewal rates, necessitated a provision for valuation losses.  If such
       adverse economic factors continue, additional valuation loss provisions
       may be required.

       Analysis of changes in the allowance for possible losses on real estate
       investments, partnership interests, notes receivable, and rents and
       interest receivable for fiscal years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and
       1991 follow:

       In addition, the Trust has established an allowance for valuation losses

       1993 and 1992, respectively.


8.     Long-Term Notes Payable:

       As of September 30, 1993 and 1992, the Trust had long-term notes
       payable, most of which are collateralized by deeds of trust on rental
       properties and are subject to compromise, due in installments extending
       to the year 2008, with interest rates ranging from 7.5% to 18.0% for the
       years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992.  Contractually scheduled
       principal payments during each of the next five years are $19,282,000,
       $11,556,000, $27,178,000, $477,000 and $3,641,000, respectively, and
       $5,439,000 thereafter.

8.     Long-Term Notes Payable, continued:

       The Trust is in default under the notes, due to, among other factors,
       its filing a petition under Chapter 11 (see Note 1).

       As a result of reorganization proceedings described in Note 1, the
       amount and/or timing of these future payments may change.  Long-term
       notes payable, mostly collateralized by deeds of trust on rental
       properties, in the amount of $15,874,000 are collateralized by CalREIT
       properties and 3604 and, therefore, are not subject to compromise.

       Two rental properties collateralizing debt of $11,272,000 at September
       30, 1993, are in the hands of receivers and are in the process of
       foreclosure.  The assets have been valued in the financial statements
       equal to the nonrecourse deeds of trust debt.

       Subsequent to September 30, 1993, a senior mortgage holder filed an
       action with the Bankruptcy Court for relief from stay with regard to its
       indebtedness which totaled $28,859,000 at September 30, 1993, and which
       is collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of
       $35,830,000 at September 30, 1993.  This action is currently scheduled
       for trial in June 1994.

9.     Principal and Deferred Interest Notes:

       On July 17, 1992, the Trust completed a restructuring of $46,000,000 in
       debentures outstanding with interest rates ranging from 9% to 9.94%, and
       a bank loan of $29,000,000 at 9%, along with unpaid interest to July 31,
       1992, aggregating $3,445,000.  Under that restructuring agreement,
       substantially all of the Trust's assets, subject to previously existing
       liens, were pledged as collateral for the restructured debt.  All sales,
       refinancings or other disposition of such pledged assets were subject to
       review by the secured lenders prior to completion.  These secured notes
       bear contractual interest at 9.5% and were due $3,445,000 on December
       31, 1992, and additional amounts of $2,500,000 on March 31, 1993 and
       $72,600,000 on June 30, 1993 (which date could have been extended if
       certain conditions which were not met had been met).  At September 30,
       1993, the balance was $72,600,000.

       The terms of the debt restructuring prohibit the Trust from making
       distributions to shareholders until all principal and capitalized
       interest scheduled for payment through December 31, 1993, have been
       paid.  No distributions were made by the Trust for the fiscal years
       ended September 30, 1993 and 1992.

       The Trust is in default under the debt restructuring agreement due to,
       among other factors, its filing a petition under Chapter 11 (see Note
       1).

10.    Distributions:

       No cash distributions were made to holders of shares of beneficial
       interest for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992.  A cash
       distribution (which was entirely return of capital) of $.20 per share of
       beneficial interest was made for the fiscal year ended September 30,
       1991.

       The property cost additions of $7,225,000 during 1992 resulted from
       recognition of in-substance foreclosures on two properties securing
       notes receivable and related interest aggregating $8,790,000, resulting
       in a valuation loss of $1,565,000.

       In 1991, the Trust was allocated an additional capital contribution of
       $166,000 in the CR Properties Partnership in conjunction with the
       purchase of property.

</TABLE>


       Four properties which collateralized notes payable in the aggregate
       amount of $29,845,000 were foreclosed upon during the year ended
       September 30, 1993, causing a net loss of $4,783,000 to be recorded.

       During the year ended September 30, 1993, the Trust sold six notes
       receivable for net proceeds of $11,538,000, reduced by other costs
       (including delinquent taxes, fees and closing costs) of $1,297,000,
       producing net cash proceeds to the Trust of $10,241,000, resulting in a
       loss of $662,000.   Two of the six notes were treated differently than
       the other four.  The Trust sold a partial interest in those notes for
       $4,968,000 in cash (resulting in a loss of $204,000).  The Trust's
       retained interest in  those two notes amounts to $3,047,000 and is
       noninterest bearing.  A discount of $1,189,000 was recorded on the
       Trust's portion of the notes as of September 30, 1992, using an imputed
       interest rate of 15%.  The agreement provides for the purchaser to
       receive interest of 18%, representing all interest on the total balance
       of such notes.  In addition, the purchaser will receive all payments on
       the notes until interest and principal is paid in full.  In the event
       the notes go into default, the Trust must cure such default or lose its
       remaining interest of $3,047,000 in the notes.

       In 1992, CalREIT modified the terms of a note receivable collateralized
       by rental property.  As a provision of the modification, $1,275,000 of
       deferred interest and $214,000 of accrued interest was added to the
       principal amount of the note.

       Interest paid on the Trust's outstanding debt for the years ended
       September 30, 1993, 1992, and 1991 was $12,579,000, $16,762,000 and
       $17,987,000, respectively.

12.    Commitments and Contingencies:

                                    Leases

       The Trust is obligated under land leases to the year 2033.  The minimum
       annual payment under the leases for each of the next five years are
       $121,000, $121,000, $121,000, $104,000, $104,000, respectively, and
       $3,324,000 thereafter.

                                   Litigation

       At the time the Trust filed its Chapter 11 petition in August 1993, it
       was party to a number of lawsuits.  Most involved ordinary disputes
       common in the real property management business, and amounts immaterial
       to the Trust's overall financial situation.

       Other lawsuits involved the following matters:

          . Claims filed by the Pacific Mutual Lenders, Senior Mortgage Holders
            and other Claim Holders as summarized in Notes 1, 2 and 8.

          . Litigation filed in 1991 naming the individual Trustees of the
            Trust and B & B, among others, as defendants, and the Trust as a
            nominal defendant.  It sought, among other things, a declaration
            that the Trust's management agreement with B & B was invalid and
            imposition of a constructive trust on and recovery of $7,195,000 by
            B&B in 1989.  (See Note 2).  This case had been in settlement
            discussions prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition.

          . A complaint filed by about 130 former Trust shareholders in 1993
            naming the Trust, current and former Trustees, B & B and its
            shareholders and various current and former professional advisors
            and consultants to the Trust as defendants.  The complaint alleged
            breach of fiduciary duty, violation of federal and state securities
            laws, violation of civil RICO, fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
            negligence and civil conspiracy.  Subsequently, the action was
            dismissed without prejudice as to the Trust.

          . A complaint was filed in April 1994 by the franchisor of most of
            the Trust's hotels, alleging trademark infringement and unfair
            business practices.  Following extensive negotiations, the parties
            entered into a settlement agreement approved by the Bankruptcy
            Court which involved ongoing licensing arrangements for the hotels.

                                     Other

       In accordance with bankruptcy proceedings, claims are filed with the
       Court by specified dates.  At September 30, 1993, the Trust recorded its
       estimate of valid claims.

       The Trust believes, based on the supporting documentation that it has,
       that the remaining excess claims will ultimately be determined not to be
       valid.  However, there is no assurance that the Court will not hold
       additional claims from the remaining excess claims to be valid; and, if
       the Court does so hold, there is no practical way of estimating what the
       total amount of additional claims would be.


13.    Basis of Presentation:

       The financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis
       which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of
       liabilities in the normal course of business; however, as a result of
       the Chapter 11 proceedings and related litigation, such realization of
       assets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to significant
       uncertainties.  These financial statements include adjustments and
       reclassifications that have been made to reflect indebtedness as
       extended under the Plan of Reorganization, as described in Note 1.  Such
       indebtedness is included in "Liabilities Subject to Compromise."  These
       financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be
       required should the Trust be unable to continue as a going concern or as
       a result of the finalization of the Chapter 11 proceedings.


14.    Liabilities Subject to Compromise:

       The Trust has $133,065,000 of liabilities which are subject to
       compromise in Chapter 11 proceedings as follows:

15.    Reorganization Items:

       Reorganization items are calculated from August 2, 1993, the date on
       which the Trust filed its petition for reorganization, and consist of
       the following:

16.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

       SFAS 107 requires disclosure of fair value information about financial
       instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which
       it is practicable to estimate that value.  In cases where quoted market
       prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using
       present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are
       significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount
       rate and estimates of future cash flows.  In that regard, the derived
       fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
       independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in
       immediate settlement of the instrument.  SFAS 107 excludes certain
       financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its
       disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts
       presented do not represent the underlying value of the Trust.

       The estimated fair value of the Trust's financial instruments at
       September 30, 1993, is as follows:

17.    Subsequent Event - CalREIT Board of Trustees:

       Effective April 14, 1994, CalREIT elected a new Board of Trustees,
       comprising Frank Morrow, Howard Cohn and Mark Bennett, all of whom are
       key management personnel of the Trust.  CalREIT also terminated certain
       management and advisory agreements with B & B and B & B Property.
       Certain disputes with B & B and B & B Property in connection with that
       termination were settled in May 1994.


18.    Income Taxes:

       At September 30, 1993, the Trust had tax net operating loss
       carryforwards (NOL) which may be applied against future taxable income
       and which expire as follows:

       The Trust's alternative minimum tax operating loss carryforwards are
       substantially the same as its NOLs at September 30, 1993.

       The Trust's ability to use its NOLs to offset future income is subject
       to restrictions enacted in the Internal Revenue Code (Code).  These
       restrictions limit the Trust's future use of its NOLs if certain stock
       ownership changes described in the Code (referred to herein as an
       Ownership Change) occur.

       The Trust does not believe that any recent or historical changes in
       stock ownership have resulted in an Ownership Change through the date of
       these financial statements.  However, depending on final approval of a
       Plan of Reorganization and other events as described in Note 1, changes
       in stock ownership which would limit the Trust's future use of its NOLs
       may occur.

18.    Income Taxes, continued:

       As stated in Note 1, during the year ended September 30, 1993, the Trust
       failed to qualify under the Internal Revenue Code to be taxed as a REIT.
       The lack of a need for a provision for income taxes has been calculated
       for fiscal 1993 according to the precepts of Accounting Principles Board
       Opinion No. 11, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

       The Trust plans to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
       109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," beginning with the fiscal
       year ending September 30, 1994.  The Trust estimates that the impact on
       the financial statements as a result of the application of SFAS 109 will
       not be material.

Trust, is Chairman of the Board, President and a shareholder of B&B Property
Investment, Development and Management Company, Inc., which was financial
advisor to the Trust until September 1, 1993.  An Advisory Agreement between

such rates as may be agreed upon and reimbursement of expenses incurred in
performing such services.  The agreement provided that B&B would reimburse the
Trust for any promotional or annual expenses which exceeded the statutory
allowable limits established by the Stated of California.  The portion of the
Advisory Agreement which related to property management services was
transferred by the Trust and B&B to B&B's wholly owned subsidiary, B&B Property
Investments, Inc. ("B&B Property") on December 20, 1979.

         During the fiscal year ended September 30, 1993, B&B and B&B property
received $2,826,000 as compensation, leasing commissions, and expense

         In addition, Mr. Berger is sole shareholder of North Main St. Co.,
which managed the Trust's hotel properties pursuant to leases, each with a
primary term expiring December 31, 1998, which provide (subject to reduction
during scheduled capital improvements projects) for annual rent of the greater
of $2,520,000 or a percentage rent based on certain revenue categories from the
hotels.  CET  received $1,854,000 from North Main St. Co pursuant to such
leases in 1993 before terminating the lease arrangement on or about July 20,
1993.

         In October 1992, the Trust entered into an Exchange Agreement with
California Real Estate Investment Trust ("Cal REIT"), its 77% owned subsidiary,
pursuant to which the Pavillions at Mesa property in Mesa, Arizona was
exchanged for notes receivable collateralized by deeds of trust owned by Cal
REIT.  The value of the transaction was estimated at the time to be
approximately $6,300,000.  Each party paid one-half of the expenses of the
exchange.  Thereafter, the Trust sold $1,084,000 of the notes for $920,000 in
cash.

         Howard E. Cohn, a Trustee of the Trust, received $252,219 fees for

         During the year ended September 30, 1993, the Trust paid fees of
$93,000 to a company owned by Mr. Gold, a Trustee, for consulting services in
connection with obtaining debt for the Trust.

**        The weighted average interest rate during the year was determined by
          dividing total interest expense related to short-term borrowings by
          average borrowings outstanding during the year.

(1) The reduction in basis resulted from a judgment against the original seller
    of the property.

(2) Represents total cost of assets after valuation allowance.

(3) The Trust establishes allowances for possible investment losses which
    represent the excess of the carrying value of individual properties over
    their appraised or estimated net realizable value.  Various external
    factors, particularly the lack of credit available to purchasers of real
    estate and overbuilt real estate markets have adversely affected real estate
    and necessitated the allowance.

                                                                59

(1) Represents carrying amount of notes after valuation allowance.

(2) The Trust establishes allowances for possible investment losses which
    represent the excess of the face amount of the note over the appraised or
    estimated net realizable value of the property securing the note.  In
    addition, discounts on the Trust's remaining interest in note sold has
    been recognized to reflect a market rate of interest.  Such write downs
    in no way limit the obligation of the borrower to comply with the terms
    of the note.

                     SERVICES AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT


         1.      IDENTIFICATION.

         This Services and Confidentiality Agreement (the "Agreement") is made
as of March 8, 1994, between Commonwealth Equity Trust, a California Real
Estate Investment Trust ("CET"), and Fama Management, Inc., a California
corporation ("Fama").

         2.      RECITALS.

                 2.1.  CET is presently a debtor in possession operating under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and is currently preparing a
plan of reorganization which will be submitted to the bankruptcy court for
approval.  CET is also negotiating plan alternatives with other parties.  CET
desires to engage an interim Chief Executive Officer to provide services to CET
pending the confirmation and effective date of a plan of reorganization in
CET's bankruptcy proceeding (the "Plan of Reorganization").

                 2.2.  In addition, CET is seeking to achieve continuity in its
management, and for that reason, desires to engage an interim Chief Executive
Officer who is able and desires to continue in the position of Chief Executive
Officer of CET following the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization.

                 2.3.  CET wishes to engage Fama to provide the services of
Frank A. Morrow ("Morrow") who will act as CET's interim Chief Executive
Officer.  Fama desires to provide Morrow's services to CET, as more
particularly described below, and in addition, desires to make Morrow available
should CET elect to engage Morrow as its Chief Executive Officer following the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

         3.      TERM.

         This Agreement shall commence on March 8, 1994, and shall continue
through July 31, 1994 (the "Original Term"), unless earlier terminated by CET
on thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Fama.  The Original Term may be
extended by CET for a period of two (2) months, on the same terms set forth
herein which apply during the Original Term.  The Original Term and any
extension thereof shall be collectively referred to herein as the "Term."

                                      68
<PAGE>   2
         5.      COMPENSATION.

         5.1.  During the Original Term, and conditioned upon Morrow's full and
faithful performance of his duties hereunder, CET shall pay to Fama, as full
and complete compensation for all of the services to be rendered by Fama
hereunder, the following:  (i) a base salary equal to One Thousand Two Hundred
Dollars ($1,200) per day, subject to a maximum limitation of Twenty Thousand
Dollars ($20,000) during each month of the Term, and, (ii) a bonus of Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000) per month during the Original Term (the "Bonus").
CET shall pay Fama one-half of the base salary on the tenth (10th) and the
twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month during the Term.  The Bonus shall accrue
but shall not become due and payable to Fama until such time as a Plan of
Reorganization has been confirmed by the bankruptcy court, and further, until
the effective date of such Plan of Reorganization.

         5.2.  If CET terminates this Agreement prior to the expiration of the
Original Term by delivery of thirty (30) days' prior written notice as set
forth in Article 3 above, the compensation to be paid by CET to Fama pursuant
to the terms hereof (i.e. base salary and Bonus) shall be prorated for the
month during which such termination occurs, and Fama shall be compensated up
until the effective date of such termination at a rate equal to (i) One
Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200) per day as base salary, subject to a
maximum limitation of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) for the month during
which such termination occurs, plus (ii) Six Hundred Dollars ($600) per day as
Bonus.

         5.3.  Fama acknowledges that neither Fama nor Morrow shall be an
employee of CET for federal tax purposes, and Fama shall be responsible for
paying all of its and Morrow's estimated income and self-employment taxes.  CET
shall have no obligation to make any withholdings from compensation payable
hereunder for state or federal taxes and shall have no other obligations of an
employer with respect to Fama and/or Morrow.  Fama shall indemnify and hold CET
harmless from and against any and all costs, liabilities, expenses, damages or
fees (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and costs) resulting from
a failure by Fama and/or Morrow to pay its or his own estimated income and
self-employment taxes.

         5.4.  All compensation payable for Morrow's services shall be payable
to Fama directly, and not to Morrow.  Morrow shall look solely to Fama to
perform and discharge, and Fama shall fully perform and discharge, and CET
shall have no responsibility or liability on account of, any obligation of an
employer, including, without limitation, the payment and/or withholding of all
sums required to be paid and/or withheld by such employer, pension, health and
welfare benefits, social security, unemployment, workers' compensation and
state disability insurance required in connection with, based on, resulting
from or relating to the





                                      69
                                      
<PAGE>   3
services to be rendered hereunder and/or the rights to be granted by Morrow
under this Agreement and/or the compensation to be paid to Fama therefore.
Fama and Morrow agree to indemnify and hold CET harmless from and against any
and all liability (including, without limitation, judgments, penalties,
interests, damages, costs, expenses and attorneys' fees) which CET may incur by
reason of Fama's failure to assume and discharge all obligations imposed on
employers (including, without limitation, with respect to income tax
withholding as discussed in Section 5.3 above).

         6.      EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS.

                 6.1.  CET shall reimburse Fama for Morrow's actual and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of Morrow's
duties hereunder.  Reimbursable expenses shall include Morrow's commuting costs
from San Francisco to Sacramento, which shall include gasoline, tolls, parking,
hotels and meals.  In addition, CET shall reimburse Fama for Morrow's business
expenses related to travel from Sacramento to Los Angeles, or other locations
requiring his presence for CET business.

                 6.2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1 above, in
no event shall the aggregate reimbursement of expenses from CET to Fama exceed
Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) in any month during the Term.

                 6.3.      CET's reimbursement of Morrow's expenses, as
described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above, is expressly conditioned upon the
following in each instance:

                          (a)      Each such expense must be of a nature
qualifying it as a proper deduction on CET's federal and state income tax
returns as a business expense, and not as deductible compensation to Fama;

                          (b)  Fama and/or Morrow furnishes CET with adequate
records and other documentary evidence required by either federal or state
statutes or regulations issued by appropriate taxing authorities for the
substantiation of such expenses as deductible business expenses of CET and not
as deductible compensation to Fama; and

                          (c)     reimbursement shall be paid and payable by
CET in accordance with its policies and procedures for making such
reimbursements in the normal course of its business.

         7.      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                 7.1.     "Confidential Information" means any information
relating to CET's business or operations which is not generally known outside
of CET or information entrusted to CET by third parties, and includes
information known as confidential or secret





                                      70
<PAGE>   4
or which reasonably should be known as confidential or secret.  Confidential
Information may relate, for example, to financial or other investment
information, shareholder information, CET's strategic planning, trade secrets,
technology, ideas, processes, computer hardware, computer software, business or
marketing plans, the names and locations of employees and/or shareholders, and
any and all other information relating to CET and the operation of its
business.  Confidential Information may be contained in materials (collectively
"Materials") such as business records, legal documents, correspondence, data,
reports, programs, contracts between CET and third parties, or computer
programs, or may be in the nature of, or consist of, unwritten knowledge,
techniques, devices, processes, practices, methods or know-how.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" does not include
information (i) which is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure by Fama, Morrow or its or his agents, (ii)
which was available to Fama and/or Morrow on a non-confidential basis prior to
disclosure of the information to Fama and/or Morrow by CET, or (iii) which
becomes available to Fama and/or Morrow on a non-confidential basis from a
person or entity other than CET, who is not otherwise bound by a written
confidentiality agreement prohibiting that person or entity from disclosing the
information.  For purposes hereof, information made public only in connection
with CET's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding shall not be deemed information
generally available to the public.

                 7.2.     Fama acknowledges that a confidential and fiduciary
relationship exists between Fama and Morrow, on the one hand, and CET, on the
other hand, in connection with CET's Confidential Information.

                 7.3.     Other than as required in order for Morrow to perform
the services contemplated herein, Fama shall not, and shall cause Morrow not
to, use, disclose, disseminate or otherwise communicate, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, at any time or in any manner, whether during
the Term or for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, any Confidential
Information, without CET's prior written consent in each instance, and Fama
shall use its best efforts to prohibit its representatives, or any third person
acting for or on Fama's or Morrow's behalf to do any of the foregoing.  If at
any time Fama and/or Morrow becomes aware of any such unauthorized use,
disclosure, dissemination or communication, or any threat thereof, Fama shall
immediately notify CET, which notice shall specify the person(s) and
circumstances relating to such unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination,
communication or threat.

                 7.4.     All Confidential Information relating to CET's
business that comes into Fama's and/or Morrow's knowledge or possession, as
between CET on the one hand, and Fama and Morrow on the other, is CET's
exclusive property, and except as necessary in





                                      71
<PAGE>   5
order for Morrow to perform the services contemplated herein, may not be
reproduced, copies, summarized or removed from CET's premises without CET's
prior written consent in each instance.  Any such Confidential Information
removed from CET's premises shall be immediately returned to CET when it is no
longer required in order for Morrow to perform his duties hereunder or upon
CET's demand at any time or times.

                 7.5.     Fama acknowledges that all Confidential Information
created by Fama and/or Morrow shall be CET's exclusive property, free of any
claim or interest of any third party, and Fama, for itself and on behalf of
Morrow, hereby irrevocably and perpetually assigns to CET all rights of every
kind or nature which arise from Morrow's and/or Fama's creation of any
Confidential Information, to the extent that CET does not already own such
rights.

                 7.6.     In CET's sole discretion, CET may elect to apply for,
obtain, register or take any action to protect or prevent the infringement,
dissemination or release of any Confidential Information.  If CET chooses to
take any such action, either during or after the Term, Fama shall:

                          (a)     take any reasonable action CET determines to
be necessary or desirable in connection with the exercise and/or protection of
these rights; and

                          (b)     execute and acknowledge before a notary and
deliver to CET, in a form suitable to CET, any document reasonably necessary or
required to obtain, exercise or protect such rights.

                 7.7.     Fama hereby irrevocably appoints any of CET's
authorized corporate officers to act as its and Morrow's agent and
attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to perform all
acts described in Section 7.6 above.

                 7.8.     Fama's covenants and agreements contained in this
Article 7 shall be deemed to be effective as of the date Fama and/or Morrow
first acquired knowledge of any Confidential Information.

                 7.9.     Fama's covenants and agreements contained in this
Article 7 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

         8.      INDEMNIFICATION.

         CET shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold
Fama and Morrow harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes
of actions, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually incurred
("Liabilities") arising out of,





                                      72
<PAGE>   6
relating to, or in connection with the discharge of Fama's and Morrow's duties
hereunder; provided, however, that CET shall have no obligation to indemnify
Fama or Morrow for any Liabilities resulting from Fama's or Morrow's bad faith,
malfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties as described
herein.

         9.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

                 9.1.     Fama is and shall remain during the Term a
corporation in good standing, duly organized and existing under the laws of the
State of California, and authorized to engage in business in the State of
California.

                 9.2.     Fama has a valid, binding and subsisting agreement
with Morrow pursuant to which Morrow is obligated to render Morrow's services
exclusively for Fama for at least the full Term, and pursuant to which Fama has
the full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and furnish Morrow's
services and to grant CET the rights herein granted.

                 9.3.     Fama has not undertaken any obligations to any
person, firm, corporation or other entity which might conflict with, interfere
with, or derogate from the rights granted to CET hereunder, or the obligations
incurred by Morrow in this Agreement.

                 9.4.     CET has been authorized by its Board of Trustees to
enter into this Agreement, and once such Agreement has been approved by the
bankruptcy court, no further approval or authority is required in order for
this Agreement to constitute a legal and binding obligation of CET.

         10.     MISCELLANEOUS.

this Agreement nor the validity or enforcement of the remainder of this
