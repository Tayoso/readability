Item 1.     Business.

A(a)  General Development of Business

Morrison Restaurants Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Registrant"
or "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1920 as a unique
cafeteria concept in Mobile, Alabama.  In 1928, with just eight
cafeterias, Morrison Restaurants Inc. had its first and only public
stock offering.  The first cash dividend on the common shares was 
declared in 1936, and has been paid continuously for 58 years. 
Beginning October 21, 1993 Morrison Restaurants Inc. common stock was
publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
"RI".  Prior to that, it was traded over-the-counter under the NASDAQ-
NMS Symbol "MORR". 

The Company has grown to a diversified restaurant company.  During
fiscal 1994 the Company structured its operations into two primary
groups: Ruby Tuesday Group, comprised of the Ruby Tuesday Division and
the Specialty Division, and Morrison Group, comprised of the Health Care
Division, the Family Dining Division and the Hospitality Division. 
Certain of the contracts and assets of the Hospitality Division were
sold by the Company on August 8, 1994, with the remaining accounts to be
closed.  Collectively, the Registrant operates 733 restaurant operations
in 38 states and Washington, D.C.  The Company at year end operated 288
Casual Dining Restaurants and 445 retail and hospital cafeterias and
Fresh Cooking outlets excluding the units of the Hospitality Division.
         
Through a corporate planning process begun early in 1982, Morrison has
reshaped its business with a series of divestitures and acquisitions
which has resulted in a significant managerial realignment with a
commitment to enhance its position in the restaurant industry.  The
Company's strategic objectives were to focus resources and capital on
retail restaurants and contract food service and to become a company in
the business of feeding people.  Important milestones in this process
are discussed below.  

On April 1, 1982, the Company completed the acquisition of Ruby Tuesday,
Incorporated, which allowed the Company to enter into the mid-scale
casual dining market.  Ruby Tuesday's interiors accented with brass and
Tiffany-style lamps, coupled with its specialty selections of salads,
soups, burgers, chicken and ethnic dishes, have propelled the chain into
national prominence.  Following the diversification strategy established
by the Company's purchase of Ruby Tuesday, the Company has since
developed and expanded into the casual dining market with the following
concepts: the L&N Seafood Grill (first unit opened March of 1982),
Mozzarella's, formerly Silver Spoon Cafes (first unit opened November
1984) and its newest test concept Sweetpea's (first unit opened June
1993).  On June 27, 1994, the Company announced that it will convert 30
of the 38 L&N Seafood Grills to other Ruby Tuesday Group concepts (Ruby
Tuesdays, Mozzarella's, or Sweetpea's) that have greater growth
opportunities. The remaining eight L&N Seafood Grills will be sold or
closed. 

The Company acquired Custom Management Corporation located in Kingston,
Pennsylvania in fiscal 1987, Dobbs Food Service Management in fiscal
1988 and Manask Food Services, Inc. in fiscal 1989.  Combined with
<PAGE>
Morrison Management Services, the self developed contract feeding
division, this portion of the business later became known as Morrison
Hospitality Group, providing food-management contracts nationwide for
all types of institutions and industry.  In fiscal 1994 the Company
structured the contract feeding division of the business into a Health
Care Division and a Hospitality Division.  In accordance with the
business and financial plans of the Company approved in fiscal 1994, on
August 8, 1994, the Company disposed of certain education, business and
industry contracts and assets (which were a part of the Morrison Group's
Hospitality Division) as a part of the Company's strategy to invest in
high growth businesses that have or can attain a dominant position in
their respective categories.
 
Another divestiture was completed in fiscal 1989, when Morco Industries,
a division of the Registrant distributing food products and food service
equipment, was sold to PYA/Monarch, the food service distribution
division of Sara Lee Corporation.  This sale enabled Morrison to
redirect the capital resources invested in Morco Industries into greater
growth opportunities.  

Fiscal 1992 was a milestone year for the Company as revenues surpassed
$1 billion, establishing the Company as one of the premier restaurant
companies in the nation. On September 30, 1992, with shareholder
approval, management decided to formally change the name of the Company
to "Morrison Restaurants Inc."  The name change solidified the direction
of the Registrant as a restaurant company.

Fiscal 1993 was again a record year in sales and earnings.  The
Specialty Restaurant Division began testing a new concept, Sweetpea's, a
full service restaurant with a casual atmosphere and freshly prepared
homemade foods. The Family Dining Division began investing in growth
with Fresh Cooking outlets which are located in mall food-courts and
serve selected items from the cafeteria menu.  This division also began
investing in a smaller cafeteria style family restaurant with a more
limited menu than existing cafeterias.                              

Fiscal 1994 marked the Company's third straight year of record sales and
earnings.  The Company implemented a new financial strategy in fiscal
1994 that focuses on the maintenance of a targeted capital structure
utilizing prudent amounts of debt to finance the Company's expansion. 
The Company's business strategy for the future focuses on more
aggressive growth in each division while increasing prior same-store
sales.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

Morrison Restaurants Inc. is a diversified restaurant company with
operations in two primary business groups:  Ruby Tuesday Group
encompassing casual dining restaurants and Morrison Group encompassing
retail cafeteria operations and the food contract management of health
care cafeterias.  Collectively, the Company operates 733 restaurant
operations in 38 states and Washington, D.C.

The Registrant is not engaged in any material research activities
relating to the development of new products or services or the improve-
ment of existing products or services.  Numerous studies are made,
however, on a continuing basis, to improve menus, equipment, and methods
of operations, including planning for new food service concepts.    

Raw materials essential to the operation of its business are obtained
from numerous sources but principally from PYA/Monarch under a cost-plus
arrangement.  The purchases from PYA/Monarch are in accordance with the
Supply Agreement between the Company and PYA/Monarch which was entered
into on July 8, 1988, in conjunction with the disposal by the Company of
the Morco Industries division.  If PYA/Monarch is unable to meet the
Company's supply needs, other sources may be utilized.  Because of the
relatively short storage life of inventories, limited storage facilities
at the restaurants themselves, the Registrant's requirement for
freshness and the numerous sources of goods, a minimum amount of
inventory is maintained at the units.  Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost (first in-first out) or market.
                                    
The Registrant has registered certain trademarks and service marks with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office; "Morrison's" , "Ruby
Tuesday", and "Mozzarella's" are three such marks.  The Registrant
believes that these and other related marks are of material importance
to the Registrant's business.  Registrations of trademarks and service
marks expire from 1995 to 2014, unless renewed.
                                                 
Portions of the Company's 1994 working capital were used to fund the
investment in capital expenditures and to repurchase shares of the
Company's common stock.  Cash that is not needed in the day-to-day
operation of the Company is invested in temporary investments.  The
terms for receivables continue to be net 30 days and inventories are
maintained only at necessary levels.  Payables continue to remain high
due to management's program to maximize the use of its assets by taking
advantage of the best terms from its vendors.

Additional information concerning the working capital of the Company is
incorporated herein by reference to information under the caption "2.4
Working Capital" of the Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders.

No material part of the business of the Registrant is dependent upon a
single customer, or a very few customers, the loss of any one of which
would have a materially adverse effect on the Registrant.

Backlog of orders is not significant in the business of the Registrant. 

There is no material portion of the Registrant's business that is
subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or
sub-contracts at the election of the Government.
<PAGE>
The Registrant's activities in the restaurant industry and related
fields are subject to vigorous competition from numerous companies as
well as individuals who are engaged in offering the same type of service
and products as the Registrant.  

Compliance with Federal, State and local laws, regulations, ordinances,
rules and provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to
the protection of the environment, is not expected to have a material
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position
of the Registrant.
                                    
The Registrant employs approximately 33,000 full-time and part-time
employees, excluding the employees of the education, business and
industry accounts which were sold on August 8, 1994.


                                    
(d)  Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and
Export Sales.

All of Registrant's wholly owned operations are located within the
United States.  The Registrant and its subsidiaries have not engaged in
material operations in foreign countries.

Item 2.  Properties.

Information regarding the locations of the Registrant's Ruby Tuesday
Group and Morrison Group (retail and hospital cafeterias) operations is
shown in the list below.  The nature of the Health Care Division of the
Morrison Group is professionally managing food and related service
systems on client-owned property.  Vending services on client-owned
facilities complement this program.  Except for 51 company-owned
properties, the Ruby Tuesday Group and retail cafeteria operations are
conducted in leased premises.  Initial lease terms expire at various
dates over the next 23 years and may provide for escalations of rents
during the lease terms.  Most of these leases provide for additional
contingent rents based upon sales volume and contain options to renew
(at adjusted rentals for some leases). Operating leases expiring in each
of the next five fiscal years are: 26 in 1995; 31 in 1996; 15 in 1997;
25 in 1998; and 25 in 1999.  The Registrant has a policy to remodel
units as needed.  Facilities and equipment are repaired and maintained
to assure their adequacy, productive capacity and utilization.  The
administrative personnel of the Registrant are located in the executive
and administrative headquarters building located in Mobile, Alabama. 
The administrative headquarters has a lease term ending in 1998 and
provides an option to purchase at a nominal amount at the end of the
initial lease term.  This building was financed through the sale of
Industrial Development Revenue Bonds from the Industrial Development
Board of the City of Mobile, Alabama. 

 
Additional information concerning the properties of the Registrant and
the lease obligations of the Registrant and its subsidiaries is
incorporated herein by reference to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in the Registrant's Annual Report to
Stockholders for the fiscal year ended June 4, 1994.

                              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Morrison Restaurants Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morrison
Restaurants Inc. as of June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 4, 1994.  Our
audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index
at Item 14(a).  These financial statements and schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Morrison Restaurants Inc. at June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended June 4, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

Notes:
 (1)  All short-term borrowings are derived from lines of credit from various banks.
       Each line of credit is subject to review by the bank and may be canceled
       by the Company at any time.  
     

 (2)  There were no short-term borrowings at any time during the periods ended
       June 5, 1993 and June 6, 1992.

 (3)  The average amount outstanding during the period was computed by dividing the total
      month-end outstanding principal balances by 12.  The Company first incurred short-term
      debt in fiscal 1994 during the 4th quarter.

 (4)  The weighted average interest rate during the period was computed by dividing the actual
      interest expense by the average daily balance of short-term debt for the period for
      which such short-term borrowings were outstanding.

                           ARTICLE I

                            OFFICES

    The Corporation shall at all times maintain a registered office in the
State of Delaware and a registered agent at that address but may have other
offices located in or outside of the State of Delaware as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine.

                          ARTICLE II

                    STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

    2.1  Places of Meetings.  All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
such place or places in or outside of the State of Delaware as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine or as may be designated in the
notice of meeting or waiver of notice thereof, subject to any provisions of
the laws of the State of Delaware.

    2.2  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
on such date in the month of September each year and at such time as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors from time to time or with respect to any
particular annual meeting for the purpose of electing directors and
transacting such other business as may come properly before the meeting. 
Written notice of the date, time and place of the annual meeting shall be
given by mail to each stockholder entitled to vote at his address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled date thereof, unless such notice is
waived as provided by Article IX of these Bylaws.

    2.3  Special Meetings.  A special meeting of stockholders may be called
at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors
or the President.  Written notice of the time, place and specific purposes of
such meeting shall be given by mail to each stockholder entitled to vote
thereat at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation not
less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled date
thereof, unless such notice is waived as provided in Article IX of these
Bylaws.

    2.4  Meetings Without Notice.  Meetings of the stockholders may be held
at any time without notice when all the stockholders entitled to vote thereat
are present in person or by proxy.

    2.5  Voting.  At all meetings of stockholders, each stockholder entitled
to vote on the record date as determined under Article VI, Section 6.3 of
these Bylaws, or if not so determined, as prescribed under the laws of the
State of Delaware, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock
standing of record in his name, subject to any restrictions or qualifications
set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, and may vote either in person
or by proxy.

    2.6  Quorum.  At any meeting of stockholders, a majority of the number
of shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum, but a smaller interest may adjourn any
meeting from time to time, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without
further notice, subject to such limitation as may be imposed under the laws
of the State of Delaware.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is
present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at
the originally scheduled meeting.

    When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the number of
shares of stock entitled to vote present thereat shall decide any question
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which a different
vote is required by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware,
or the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in which case such
express provision shall govern.

    2.7  List of Stockholders.  At least ten (10) days before every meeting,
a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged
in alphabetical order and showing the address of and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be prepared by the Secretary
or the transfer agent in charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation.  Such
list shall be open for examination by any stockholder, for any purpose germane
to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten
(10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the
meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. 
The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present.  The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the
stockholders entitled to examine such list or the books of the Corporation or
to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

    2.8  Action Without Meeting.  Any action required by the laws of the
State of Delaware or the Certificate of Incorporation to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of stockholders, or any action which may be taken
at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without
a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all the holders of
outstanding stock entitled to vote at such meeting.

                          ARTICLE III

                      BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    3.1  Powers.  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
carried on by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, which shall
have all the powers authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware, subject
to such limitations as may be provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws.

    3.2  Number, Qualification and Term.  The initial number of directors
shall be such as may be determined by the incorporator(s) and thereafter the
number of directors shall be not less than nine (9) and not more than twelve
(12), the exact number within such minimum and maximum limits to be fixed and
determined from time to time by resolution of a majority of the Board of
Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of all
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, as provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation.

    Directors shall be of full age, and no person shall be nominated for the
Board of Directors who shall have attained the age of seventy (70) on or
before the annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected,
provided, however, under special conditions in the best interests of the
Corporation, as determined by the Board of Directors or the shareholders, a
person may be nominated for the Board of Directors who has attained the age
of seventy (70) before such meeting.  Directors need not be residents of the
State of Delaware, however, directors must be stockholders of the Corporation.

    The initial Board of Directors shall be elected by the incorporator(s). 
Thereafter, Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders
by a plurality of the votes cast at such election.  Each director shall serve
until the election and qualification of his successor or until his earlier
death, resignation or removal as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
and these Bylaws.  In case of an increase in the number of directors between
elections by the stockholders, the additional directorships shall be
considered vacancies and shall be filled in the manner prescribed in Article
V of these Bylaws.

    The Board of Directors may, by majority vote, elect a Chairman of the
Board of Directors.  The Chairman shall be a member of the Board and shall
preside at all meetings of the stockholders and of the Board of Directors and
shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as the Board of
Directors may prescribe from time to time.

    3.3  Compensation.  The Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, may
from time to time by resolution authorize the payment of fees or other
compensation to the directors for services as such to the Corporation,
including, but not limited to, fees for attendance at all meetings of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, and determine the amount of such
fees and compensation.  Directors shall in any event be paid their traveling
expenses for attendance at all meetings of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude
any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor in amounts authorized or otherwise approved from time
to time by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

    3.4  Meetings and Quorum.  Meetings of the Board of Directors may be
held either in or outside of the State of Delaware.  A quorum shall be one-
third (1/3) of the number of directors then fixed in the manner provided in
Section 3.2 of this Article but not less than two (2) directors.  The act of
a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which there is a quorum
shall be the act of the Board of Directors.  If a quorum is not present at any
meeting, the Directors who are present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
is obtained, subject to such limitation as may be imposed under the laws of
the State of Delaware.

    The Board of Directors shall, at the close of each annual meeting of
stockholders and without further notice other than these Bylaws, if a quorum
of directors is then present or as soon thereafter as may be convenient, hold
a regular meeting for the election of officers and the transaction of any
other business.

    The Board of Directors may from time to time provide for the holding of
regular meetings with or without notice and may fix the times and places at
which such meetings are to be held, meetings other than regular meetings may
be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the
President and must be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary upon the request of at least three
directors.

    Notice of each meeting, other than a regular meeting (unless required
by the Board of Directors), shall be given to each director by mailing the
same to each director at his residence or business address at least two (2)
days before the meeting or by delivering the same to him personally or by
telephone or telegraph at least one (1) day before the meeting unless, in case
of exigency, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, as the case may be, shall prescribe a
shorter notice to be given personally or by telephone, telegraph, cable or
facsimile transmission to all or any one or more of the directors at their
respective residences or places of business.  Notice will be deemed to have
been given at the time it is mailed, postage-prepaid, or sent by telegraph,
cable or facsimile transmission, or given by telephone, as the case may be.

    Notice of any meeting shall state the time and place of such meeting,
but need not state the purposes thereof unless otherwise required by the laws
of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Board of
Directors.

    3.5  Executive Committee.  The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted
by a majority of the number of directors then fixed in the manner provided in
Section 3.2 of this Article, may provide for an Executive Committee of three
or more directors and shall elect the members thereof to serve during the
pleasure of the Board of Directors.  The Executive Committee shall elect its
own chairman, unless a chairman has been designated by the Board of Directors. 
Special meetings of the Executive Committee may be called by the chairman of
the committee or by the Board of Directors, and notice of meetings of the
Executive Committee shall be given by the chairman of the committee or by the
Secretary, in the manner provided in Article IX of these Bylaws.

    The Board of Directors may at any time change the membership of the
Executive Committee, fill vacancies in it, designate alternate members to
replace any absent or disqualified members at any meeting of the Executive
Committee, or dissolve it.

    During the intervals between the meetings of the Board of Directors, the
Executive Committee shall possess and may exercise any or all of the powers
of the Board of Directors in the management or direction of the business and
affairs of the Corporation to the extent authorized by resolution adopted by
a majority of the number of directors then fixed in the manner provided in
Section 3.2 of this Article, subject to such limitations as may be imposed by
the laws of the State of Delaware.

    Except as inconsistent with these Bylaws or the resolution of the Board
of Directors from time to time, the Executive Committee may determine its
rules of procedure and the notice to be given of its meeting, and it may
appoint such committees as it shall from time to time deem necessary.  A
majority of the members of the Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum. 
The Executive Committee shall keep minutes of its meetings and shall report
the same to the Board of Directors.

    3.6  Other Committees.  The Board of Directors may by resolution provide
for such other committees as it deems desirable and may discontinue the same
at its pleasure.  Each such committee shall have the powers and perform such
duties, not inconsistent with law, as may be assigned to it by the Board of
Directors.

    Each such committee shall elect its own chairman, unless a chairman has
been designated by the Board of Directors.

    Except as inconsistent with these Bylaws or the resolution of the Board
of Directors from time to time, each such committee may determine its rules
of procedure and the notice to be given of its meeting, and it may appoint
such committees as it shall from time to time deem necessary. Special meetings
of any such committee may be called by the chairman of that committee or by
the Board of Directors, and notice of any meeting of any such committee shall
be given by the chairman of that committee or by the Secretary in the manner
provided in Article IX of these Bylaws.  A majority of the members of any such
committee then in office shall constitute a quorum.  Each such committee shall
keep minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors.

    3.7  Conference Telephone Meetings.  Any one or more members of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting by
means of a conference telephone or similar communication equipment by means
of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

    3.8  Action Without Meeting.  To the extent authorized by Delaware law,
any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all
members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of
the proceedings of the Board of Director or committee.

    Assistant Secretary also shall perform such other duties and have such
    other powers as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Board
    of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President.

         (e)  Treasurer.  The Treasurer shall have the care and custody of

    be assigned to them from time to time by the Board of Directors, the
    Chairman of the Board or the President.

discretion, the Board of Directors may designate either the Chairman of the
Board or the President to serve as the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief
Operating Officer, or both, of the Corporation.

                           ARTICLE V

             RESIGNATIONS, VACANCIES AND REMOVALS

    5.1  Resignations.  Any director or officer may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the
Board, the President or the Secretary.  Any such resignation shall take effect
at the time specified therein or, if the time be not specified, upon receipt
thereof; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of any
resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

    5.2  Vacancies.

         (a)  Directors.  Any vacancy in the Board of Directors caused by
    reason of death, incapacity, resignation, removal, increase in the
    authorized number of directors or otherwise may be filled by a majority
    vote of the remaining directors though less than a quorum, or by the
    sole remaining director.

         Any director so elected by the Board of Directors shall serve
    until the next annual meeting of stockholders at which directors of the
    class in which such director serves are to be elected and until the
    election and qualification of his successor or until his earlier death,
    resignation or removal as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
    or these Bylaws.  The Board of Directors also may reduce their
    authorized number by the number of vacancies in the Board, provided such
    reduction does not reduce the Board to less than the minimum authorized
    by the laws of the State of Delaware or to less than the number of
    directors then in office.

         (b)  Officers.  The Board of Directors may at any time or from
    time to time fill any vacancy among the officers of the Corporation.

    5.3  Removals.

         (a)  Directors.  The entire Board of Directors, or any individual
    member thereof, may be removed only as provided in the Certificate of
    Incorporation.

         (b)  Officers.  Subject to the provisions of any validly existing
    agreement, the Board of Directors may at any meeting remove from office
    any officer, with or without cause, and may elect or appoint a
    successor.









                          ARTICLE VI

                         CAPITAL STOCK

    6.1  Certificates of Stock.  Every stockholder shall be entitled to a
certificate or certificates for shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
in such form as may be prescribed or authorized by the Board of Directors,
duly numbered and setting forth the number and kind of shares represented
thereby.  Such certificates shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, the
Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or Vice President, and by the
Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. 
If and to the extent permitted by Delaware law, any or all of such signatures
may be in facsimile if the certificate is manually signed on behalf of a
transfer agent or a registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an
employee of the Corporation.

    In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed on a certificate has ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before the certificate has been issued,
such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation
with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar
at the date of issue.

    6.2  Transfer of Stock.  Shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
shall be transferable only upon the books of the Corporation upon the
surrender of the certificate or certificates properly assigned and endorsed
for transfer.

    The Board of Directors may appoint a transfer agent and one or more co-
transfer agents and a registrar and one or more co-registrars and may make or
authorize such agents to make all such rules and regulations deemed expedient
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock.  If the
Corporation has a transfer agent or registrar acting on its behalf, the
signature of any officer or representative thereof may be in facsimile.

    6.3  Stock Transfer Records.  Unless the Corporation has a stock
transfer agent to keep such records, the Secretary shall keep a stock book or
books containing the names, alphabetically arranged, with the address of every
stockholder showing the number of shares of each kind, class or series of
stock held of record.

    The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the
Corporation shall be deemed by the Corporation to be the owner thereof for all
purposes.

    6.4  Record Dates.  In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors shall fix in
advance a record date which, in the case of a meeting, shall not be less than
ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled date of such
meeting and which, in the case of any other action, shall be not more than
sixty (60) days prior to any such action permitted by the laws of the State
of Delaware.

    A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

    6.5  Lost Certificates.  In case of loss, mutilation or destruction of
a stock certificate, a duplicate certificate may be issued upon such terms as
may be determined or authorized by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the
Board or the President.

first Saturday following May 30 each year.

    7.2  Bank Deposits, Checks, Etc.  The funds of the Corporation shall be
deposited in the name of the Corporation or of any division thereof in such
banks or trust companies in the United States or elsewhere as may be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, or by such officer or
officers as the Board of Directors may authorize to make such designations.

    All checks, drafts or other orders for the withdrawal of funds from any
bank account shall be signed by such person or persons as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors.  The signatures on checks, drafts
or other orders for the withdrawal of funds may be in facsimile if authorized
in the designation.

                         ARTICLE VIII

                       BOOKS AND RECORDS

    8.1  Place of Keeping Books.  The books and records of the Corporation
may be kept in or outside of the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine.

    8.2  Examination of Books.  Except as may otherwise be provided by the
laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have power to determine from time to time
whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what
conditions any of the accounts, records and books of the Corporation are to
be open to the inspection of any stockholder.  No stockholder shall have any
right to inspect any account or book or document of the Corporation except as
prescribed by law or authorized by express resolution of the stockholders or
of the Board of Directors.

                          ARTICLE IX

                            NOTICES

    9.1  Requirements of Notice.  Whenever notice is required to be given
by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, it shall not
mean personal notice unless so specified, but such notice may be given in
writing by depositing the same in a post office, letter box, or mail chute
postage prepaid and addressed to the person to whom such notice is directed
at the address of such person on the records of the Corporation, and such
notice shall be deemed given at the time when the same shall be thus mailed.

    9.2  Waivers.  Any stockholder, director or officer may, in writing or
by telegram or cable, at any time waive any notice or other formality required
by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.  Such waiver of
notice, whether given before or after any meeting or action, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice.  Presence of a stockholder either in person or by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders and presence of any director at any meeting of
the Board of Directors shall constitute a waiver of such notice as may be
required by any statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.  

                           ARTICLE X

                             SEAL

    The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be in such form as the Board
of Directors shall determine from time to time and may consist of a facsimile
thereof or the words "Corporate Seal" or "Seal" enclosed in parentheses.

    In the absence of the Secretary, any other officer of the Corporation
may affix and attest the seal of the Corporation to any instrument requiring
it, unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Board of Directors.

                          ARTICLE XI

                      POWERS OF ATTORNEY

    The Board of Directors may authorize one or more of the officers of the
Corporation to execute powers of attorney delegating to named representatives
or agents power to represent or act on behalf of the Corporation, with or
without power of substitution.

    In the absence of any action by the Board of Directors, any officer of
the Corporation may execute for and on behalf of the Corporation waivers of
notice of meetings of stockholders and proxies for such meetings of any
company in which the Corporation may hold voting securities.

                          ARTICLE XII

            INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
                  EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PERSONS

    12.1 Action Other Than by or in the Right of the Corporation.  Subject
to Section 12.3 hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
and whether external or internal to the Corporation (other than a judicial
action or suit brought by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of
the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Agent"), against expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments. fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit
or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in an manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

    12.2 Action by or in the Right of the Corporation.  The Corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed judicial action or suit
brought by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was an Agent against expenses
(including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication
of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity of such expenses which the Court
of Chancery or other such court shall deem proper.

    12.3 Determination of Right of Indemnification.  Any indemnification
under Sections 12.1 or 12.2 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made
by the Corporation unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made
(i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
directors who are or were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or
(ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum
of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders, that such person acted in bad
faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was unlawful.

    12.4 Indemnification Against Expenses of Successful Party. 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article XII, to the extent that
an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including the
dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action
without admission of liability, in defense of any proceeding or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, such Agent shall be indemnified against
all expenses incurred in connection therewith.

    12.5 Advances of Expenses.  Except as limited by Section 12.6. expenses
incurred in defending or investigating any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such matter, if the Agent shall undertake to repay such amount
in the event that it is ultimately determined, as provided herein, that such
person is not entitled to indemnification.  However, no advance shall be made
by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the
Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors,
or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of
disinterested directors so directs) by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, that, based upon the facts known to the Board of Directors or counsel
at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in
a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding,
that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful.  In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Board
of Directors or independent legal counsel reasonably determines that such
person deliberately breached his duty to the Corporation or its stockholders.

    12.6 Right of Agent to Indemnification Upon Application; Procedure Upon
Application.  Any indemnification under Sections 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 hereof
or advance under Section 12.5 hereof shall be made promptly and in any event
within 45 days, upon the written request of the Agent, unless with respect to
applications under Sections 12.2, 12.3 or 12.5 hereof, a determination is
reasonably and promptly made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of
a quorum of disinterested directors that such Agent acted in a manner set
forth in such Sections as to justify the Corporation not indemnifying or
making an advance to the Agent.  In the event no quorum of disinterested
directors is obtainable, the Board of Directors shall promptly direct that
independent legal counsel shall decide whether the Agent acted in the manner
set forth in such Sections as to justify the Corporation not indemnifying or
making an advance to the Agent.  The right to indemnification or advances as
granted by this Article XIl shall be enforceable by the Agent in any court of
competent jurisdiction if the Board of Directors or independent legal counsel
denies the claim, in whole or in part, or if no disposition of such claim is
made within 45 days.  The Agent's expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part,
in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

    12.7 Other Rights and Remedies.  The indemnification provided by this
Article XII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Agent seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, court order or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.  It is the policy of the Corporation that indemnification
of Agents shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law.  All rights
to indemnification under this Article XII shall be deemed to be provided by
a contract between the Corporation and the Agent who serves in such capacity
at any time while these Bylaws and other relevant provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and other applicable law, if any, are
in effect.  Any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or
obligations then existing.

    12.8 Insurance of Agents.  To the extent permitted by Delaware law, the
Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who
is or was an Agent against any liability asserted against him and incurred by
him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability
under the provisions of this Article XII.

    12.9 Certain Definitions.  For purposes of this Article XII, references
to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power to indemnify its directors,
officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article XII
with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued; references to "other enterprises" in Section 1 shall include
employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references
to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as
a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director or officer with respect to any employee benefit
plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article XII.

    12.10     Indemnification and Insurance of Other Persons.  The
provisions of this Article XII shall not be deemed to preclude the Corporation
from either indemnifying or purchasing and maintaining insurance on behalf of,
or both, any person who is not an Agent but whom the Corporation has the power
or obligation to indemnify or insure under the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or otherwise.  The Corporation may,
in its sole discretion, indemnify or insure, or both, an employee, trustee or
other agent as permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.  The Corporation shall indemnify or insure any employee, trustee or
other agent where required by law.

    12.11     Survival of Indemnification.  The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article XII
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such Agent.

    12.12     Savings Clause.  If this Article XII or any portion thereof
shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction,
then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Agent against expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, and whether internal or external, including
a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of
the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of
this Article XII that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other
applicable law.


                         ARTICLE XIII

                          AMENDMENTS

    Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
another provision of these Bylaws, these Bylaws may be amended or repealed
either:

         (a)  at any meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present
    by vote of the holders of a majority of the number of shares of stock
    entitled to vote present in person or by proxy at such meeting as
    provided in Article II, Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of these Bylaws, or

         (b)  at any meeting of the Board of Directors by a majority vote
    of the directors then in office;

provided the notice of such meeting of stockholders or directors or waiver of
notice thereof contains a statement of the substance of the proposed amendment
or repeal.

                            DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION


2.01  Definitions:

      (a)    The term "Annual Base Salary" refers to the base pay and
             sales commissions, if payable, received by a Participant
             from an Employer during a calendar year, and excluding
             any amounts paid to him as overtime, bonuses, incentive
             compensation, and contributions to this or any other
             pension benefit plan to which an Employer contributes
             directly or indirectly.

      (b)    The term "Accrued Benefit" refers to the annual benefit
             to which a Participant would be entitled, determined
             pursuant to Section 3.01, based on his Final Base Salary
             and his Continuous Service at the date of calculation,
             commencing on his Normal Retirement Date in the mode of
             a single-life annuity.

      (c)    The term "Board" refers to the Board of Directors of the
             Company, as duly constituted from time-to-time.

      (d)    The term "Committee" refers to those three members of the
             Board who shall be appointed by the Board to manage and
             administer the Plan in accordance with the provisions of
             Article VII hereof.

      (e)    The term "Company" refers to Morrison Incorporated, a
             Florida corporation, having its administrative offices in
             Mobile, Alabama.

      (f)    The term "Continuous Service" refers to the period of
             unbroken employment of an Employee with the Company or
             one or more of its subsidiaries from his last date of
             employment, but shall not include a period of employment
             beyond the Participant's Normal Retirement Date.

             Continuous Service shall not include a period of
             employment subsequent to an Employee's participation in
             this Plan if the Employee's HAY points are less than 850
             in the period.  Furthermore, Continuous Service shall not
             include a period of employment subsequent to an
             Employee's participation in this Plan if the Committee
             has expressly terminated an Employee's participation in
             this Plan.

             Continuous Service of an Employee shall not be broken by
             and shall include the periods of:
             (1)   his absence in the Armed Forces of the United
                   States or any of its allies in time of war in which
                   the United States shall be engaged, or in the Armed
                   Forces of the United States while any form of law
                   requiring compulsory military service shall be in
                   effect, if the Employee directly enters such Armed
                   Forces and does not reenlist after the date of
                   first entering and makes application for
                   reemployment by the Company within ninety (90)
                   days, or such longer period as may be prescribed by
                   applicable law, after discharge or release from
                   such Armed Forces or from hospitalization
                   continuing for a period of not more than one year
                   after discharge or release from such Armed Forces
                   and is reemployed by the Company; and/or

             (2)   his absence because of lay-off not in excess of one
                   (1) years if the Employee returns to employment
                   with the Company when notified of his recall to
                   work.

                   An Employee whose Continuous Service has been
                   broken because of termination employment and who is
                   thereafter reemployed by the Company shall be
                   deemed to be newly employed for all purposes of the
                   Plan and any previous service shall be disregarded
                   for purposes of the Plan.

                   An Employee whose Continuous Service has been
                   broken because his HAY points have dropped to less
                   than 850 or because the Committee acted to
                   terminate his participation in the Plan and who
                   subsequently has 850 or more HAY points or who
                   subsequently has his participation in this Plan
                   reinstated by action of the Committee shall have
                   his periods of Continuous Service aggregated for
                   purposes of calculating his Accrued Benefit.

      (g)    The term "Effective Date" shall mean May 27, 1983.

      (h)    The term "Eligible Employee" refers to any individual
             employed on a full-time basis by the Company or one or
             more of its subsidiaries, who has earned at least 850 HAY
             points, has three (3) years of service as a year of
             service is defined in Morrison Incorporated Retirement
             Plan, and has been selected for participation by the
             Committee.

      (i)    The term "Final Base Salary" refers to the dollar amount
             determined by obtaining the average of the Participant's
             Annual Base Salary over the five (5) consecutive Plan
             Years which produce the highest average.  If the
             Participant retires, terminates employment, or ceases to
             accrue Continuous Service due to a drop in HAY points or
             action of the Committee, his Annual Base Salary for the
             final partial year of participation shall be annualized
             for purposes of calculating the Final Base Salary.

             As an example of the manner in which this definition is
             intended to operate, assume a Participant earns an Annual
             Base Salary of Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000) in the
             fourth and third Plan Years preceding the Plan Year in
             which he reaches his Normal Retirement Date, and an
             Annual Base Salary of Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000)
             in the second and first Plan Years preceding such year,
             as well as in the year of his normal retirement.  Assume
             further that in all other Plan Years, the Participant's
             Annual Base Salary was less than $60,000.  Based on such
             assumptions, the Participant's Final Base Salary will
             equal:

                               $  60,000
                                  60,000
                                  80,000
                                  80,000
                                  80,000             $360,000 
                                ---------            --------- =$72,000
                                $360,000                  5

      (j)    The term "Normal Retirement Date" refers to the 65th
             anniversary of the Participant's birth.

      (k)    The term "Participant" refers to any Eligible Employee
             upon his entry into the Plan.  Upon retirement,
             termination of employment, or if a Participant's HAY
             points drop to less then 850 or if the Committee acts to
             terminate the participation of an Employee under this
             Plan, such Employee's status as a Participant will be
             terminated, and he will be classified as a former
             Participant.

      (l)    The term "Plan" refers to the unfunded supplemental
             retirement plan embodied herein, as amended from time-to-
             time, to be known as the Morrison Incorporated Executive
             Supplemental Pension Plan.

      (m)    The term "Plan Year" refers to any calendar year within
             which the Plan shall be in effect.

      (n)    The term "Primary Social Security Benefit" means the
             annual primary insurance amount available to the
             Participant at age 65 under the Social Security Act as in
             effect at the date of calculation, without regard to
             whether such amount actually commences to be paid and
             without regard to any increase in the Social Security
             Base or benefit levels that may take effect after such
             date of calculation.

             The Primary Social Security Benefit will be calculated as
             though the Participant had a full Social Security
             Earnings Record and as though the Participant always
             earned at least the Social Security Taxable Wage Base.

             The date of calculation will be the retirement date,
             termination date, date when HAY points drop below 850, or
             date of cessation of participation as determined by the
             Committee, whichever is applicable.  The Primary Social
             Security Benefit will be calculated based on the Social
             Security Law in effect on the first day of the calendar
             year of the date of calculation, and assuming constant
             Social Security Taxable Wage Bases for the future years.

             the Participant's years and fractional years of
             Continuous Service not in excess of twenty (20) years of
             Continuous Service; plus

      (B)    1% of the Participant's Final Base Salary multiplied by
             the Participant's years and fractional years of
             Continuous Service in excess of twenty (20) years of
             Continuous Service, but not in excess of thirty (30) such

      For purposes of this Section 3.01, each completed month of

      of Continuous Service.

3.02  Distribution of Benefits:

      Benefits accrued hereunder shall be paid in accordance with
      Article V.

3.03  Encumbrance of Award:

      No Participant or beneficiary of a Participant shall have any
      right to commute, encumber, transfer or otherwise dispose of
      or alienate any present or future right or expectancy which he
      may have at any time to receive payment of benefits, which
      benefits and the right thereto are expressly declared to be
      non-assignable and non-transferable.  Any attempt to transfer
      or assign a benefit, or any rights granted hereunder, by a
      Participant or his beneficiaries shall, in the sole discretion
      of the Committee after consideration of such facts as it deems
      pertinent, be grounds for terminating any rights of the
      Participant and his beneficiaries to any portion of the
      benefits not previously paid by the Company.
                                     ARTICLE IV

                             RETIREMENT OF PARTICIPANTS


4.01  Normal Retirement:

      A Participant may continue in the service of the Company
      beyond his Normal Retirement Date, but shall not be permitted
      to continue in the employ of the Company without first
      obtaining the Company's consent, subsequent to the age at
      which the Company may require the retirement of the
      Participant under applicable federal and state laws.  If a
      Participant continues in service beyond his Normal Retirement
      Date, he shall be deemed to be retired upon his Postponed
      Retirement Date as determined under the Morrison Incorporated
      Retirement Plan.

4.02  Early Retirement:

      A Participant may retire from service with the Company or any
      of its subsidiaries prior to reaching his Normal Retirement
      Date and commence receiving benefits from this Plan if
      eligible for Early Retirement under the terms of the Morrison
      Incorporated Retirement Plan.  The Accrued Benefit under this
      Plan, as described in Section 3.01, will be reduced for Early
      Retirement using the same factors as are used in the Morrison
      Incorporated Retirement Plan, namely:

                Age                          Early Retirement Factor

                 64                                       .93
                 63                                       .86
                 62                                       .79
                 61                                       .72
                 60                                       .65
                 59                                       .62
                 58                                       .59
                 57                                       .56
                 56                                       .53
                 55                                       .50

      A Participant must commence receiving benefits under this Plan
      at the same time as he commences receiving benefits under the
      Morrison Incorporated Retirement Plan.


                                      ARTICLE V

                        VESTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS


5.01  Vesting:

      A Participant's Accrued Benefit shall vest in the Participant
      at such time as he reaches his Normal or Early Retirement
      Date.  If a Participant terminates employment other than by
      retirement or death, he shall be vested in his Accrued Benefit
      is he has completed ten (10) or more Years of Service
      determined under the Morrison Incorporated Retirement Plan. If
      a Participant terminates employment other than by retirement
      or death and has not completed ten (10) or more Years of
      Service determined under the Morrison Incorporated Retirement
      Plan, he shall not be vested in his Accrued Benefit, his
      Accrued Benefit shall be cancelled and he shall not be
      entitled to any further benefits from the Plan.

5.02  Payment of Benefits:

      When a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date, retires
      by reason of the Early Retirement provisions of the Plan
      (Section 4.02), or otherwise terminates his service with the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Committee shall
      determine and certify to the Treasurer of the Company the
      vested Accrued Benefit of the Participant, if any, and shall
      further determine and certify the method by which payments
      shall be made.  The Company shall thereafter make payments of
      the benefits in the manner and at the times so designated,
      subject, however, to all other terms and conditions of the
      Plan.

      A benefit payable under this Plan shall be paid in the same
      form and at the same time as the retirement benefit payable to
      the retired Participant under the Morrison Incorporated
      Retirement Plan.  If the benefit payable under this Plan is
      paid other than as a life annuity, the amount of the benefit
      when paid in such other form shall be determined by using the
      actuarial equivalence factors of the Morrison Incorporated
      Retirement Plan.

5.03  Death of Participant:

      If a Participant shall die during the term of his employment
      with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and prior to his
      retirement or other termination from service, the said
      employment shall be deemed to have terminated on the date of
      the Participant's death and the Company shall have no further
      obligation to the Participant, his estate, heirs or
      beneficiaries under this Plan, it being specifically the
      intention of the Board in creating this Plan that it
      supplement, by way of providing living retirement benefits,
      the existing insurance benefit program which will protect the
      interests of the families of executive employees who die while
      in the Continuous Service of the Company or any of its
      subsidiaries.

      If a Participant shall die after his retirement or other
      termination of service, benefit payments shall continue to the
      Participant's designated beneficiaries, or his estate, at such
      times and in such manner, as is provided for under the form of
      payment determined under the provisions of Section 6.02 of the
      Plan.  Each Participant shall notify the Committee in writing
      of the name and address of his primary alternative
      beneficiaries, which may be changed from time-to-time by the
      Participant by written notice delivered to the Committee.

                             CONDITIONS AND FORFEITURES

If a Participant's Continuous Service is terminated because of his
proven or admitted fraud or dishonesty of a material nature, his
willful damage to the property, reputation or goodwill of the
Company, or any of its subsidiaries, his conviction of a felony,
his willful and material insubordination or violation of Company
rules, and/or his gross neglect of duties assigned by the Company;
and if such act or action adversely affects the Company in a
substantial respect, then notwithstanding any other provision of
this Plan, the Committee may determine that any benefits to which
such Participant might otherwise have been entitled under the Plan
shall be forfeited.  The decision of the Committee with respect to
sufficiency of the proof or admission of such act or action, the
substantially adverse effect thereof, and the forfeiture resulting
therefrom, as long as made with consistency and sound judgment,
shall be final and binding.

      acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at
      which a quorum is present or the acts unanimously approved in
      writing by all such members shall be valid acts of the
      Committee.

7.03  Powers and Duties:

      The Committee shall have the power and duty to do all things
      necessary or convenient to effect the intent and purposes of
      the Plan and not inconsistent with any of the provisions
      hereof, whether or not such powers and duties are specifically
      set forth herein, and, in amplification and not limitation of
      the foregoing, the Committee shall have power to:

      (a)    provide rules and regulations for the administration of
             the Plan, and from time-to-time, to amend or supplement
             such rules and regulations;

      (b)    construe the Plan, which construction, as long as made in
             good faith, shall be final and conclusive upon all
             parties thereto;

      (c)    correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any
             inconsistency in the Plan in such manner and to such
             extent as it shall deem expedient to carry the same into
             effect, and it shall be the sole and final judge of when
             such action shall be appropriate.

7.04  Finality of Action:

      The acts and determinations of the Committee within the powers
      conferred by the Plan shall be final and conclusive for all
      purposes of the Plan and shall not be subject to appeal or
      review by persons or entities other than the Board.

7.05  Liability:

      No member of the Committee shall be directly or indirectly
      responsible or under any liability by reason of any action or
      default by him as a member of the Committee, or the exercise
      of or failure to exercise any power or discretion as such
      member, except for his own fraud or willful misconduct; and no
      member of the Committee shall be liable in any way for the
      acts or defaults of any other member of the Committee or any
      of its advisors, agents or representatives.  The Company shall
      indemnify and save harmless each member of the Committee
      against any and all expenses and liabilities arising out of
      his own membership on the Committee, except expenses and
      liabilities arising out of his own fraud or willful
      misconduct.

7.06  Compensation and Expenses:

      The members of the Committee may receive such reasonable
      compensation for their services as may be authorized from
      time-to-time by the Board, and except as otherwise provided
      above, shall be entitled to receive their reasonable expenses
      incurred in administering the Plan.  Any such compensation and
      expenses, as well as extraordinary expenses authorized by the
      Board, shall be paid by the Company.

7.07  Information Furnished to Committee:

      The Company shall furnish to the Committee in writing all
      information the Company deems appropriate for the Committee to
      exercise its powers and duties in administration of the Plan.

      names of all Eligible Employees, their Annual Base
      Compensation, and their dates of birth, employment,

      any investigation thereof; provided, however, that the
      Committee may correct any errors discovered in any such
      information.

      The Committee shall make available to each Participant for
      examination by him, at the principal office of the Company or

      to any compensation, payment or benefit payable hereunder,
      shall rely solely upon the unsecured promise of the Company as
      set forth herein for the payment thereof, and nothing herein
      contained shall be construed to give to or vest in the
      Participant or any other person now or at any time in the
      future, any right, title, interest or claim in or to any
      specific asset, fund, reserve, account or property of any kind
      whatever owned by the Company or in which it may have any
      right, title or interest now or at any time in the future.

8.02  Additional Benefits:

      It is agreed and understood that any benefits accrued under

      other compensation plan of the Company, and that this Plan
      shall not affect or impair the rights or obligations of the

      any award made hereunder which shall have vested in him as of
      the time of such Board action.

8.04  Enforceability:

      shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent and in the
      broadest application permitted by law.

                              FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE
                               MORRISON INCORPORATED
                        EXECUTIVE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN


      THIS FIRST AMENDMENT, made as of the 30th day of  June  , 1994, by
MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC., f/k/a Morrison Incorporated, a corporation duly
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Primary
Sponsor"); 

                                W I T N E S E T H:

      WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor maintains the Morrison Incorporated
Executive Supplemental Pension Plan under a restated indenture effective as
of June 1, 1986 (the "Plan"); and

      WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor now desires to amend the Plan in order to
make certain changes to its eligibility provisions and for other reasons;


      NOW, THEREFORE, the Primary Sponsor does hereby amend the Plan,
effective January 1, 1994, as follows:

1.    By deleting existing Section 2.01(d) in its entirety and by substituting
therefor the following:  "[Reserved]."  In addition, the term "Plan
Administrator" shall be substituted in lieu of the term "Committee" each time
the latter term appears in the Plan.

2.    By deleting existing Section 2.01(e) in its entirety and by substituting
therefor the following:

      "(e)   The term `Company' refers to Morrison Restaurants Inc., f/k/a
             Morrison Incorporated, a Delaware corporation."

3.    By deleting the existing second and final paragraphs of Section 2.01(f)
in their entirety and by substituting therefor the following:

      "With respect to Eligible Employees who were Participants in the Plan
      prior to January 1, 1994, Continuous Service shall not include any
      period of employment subsequent to an Employee's participation in the
      Plan from and after the date the Plan Administrator has expressly
      terminated an Employee's participation in the Plan, unless and until he
      or she thereafter qualifies as an Eligible Employee in accordance with
      the provisions of the immediately succeeding sentence.  With respect to
      Eligible Employees who first become Participants in the Plan after
      December 31, 1993, Continuous Service shall not include any period of
      employment subsequent to an Employee's participation in the Plan (i)
      during which the Employee no longer holds any one of the Qualifying
      Positions, (ii) following three (3) consecutive Plan Years during which
      the Participant failed to earn an annual salary, plus bonus, of at least
      $120,000 (as adjusted in accordance with Plan Section 2.01(h)); or (iii)
      from and after the date the Plan Administrator has expressly terminated
      an Employee's participation in the Plan.  An Eligible Employee who
      experiences a break in Continuous Service as described in this paragraph
      who again becomes an Eligible Employee or who is reinstated by action
      of the Plan Administrator shall have his periods of Continuous Service
      aggregated for purposes of calculating his Accrued Benefit, but in no
      event shall such aggregated periods of Continuous Service include
      periods during which the Employee no longer holds any Qualifying
      Position; any period of employment during which the Employee is not an
      Eligible Employee following a three-consecutive Plan Year period in
      which the Employee failed to earn at least $120,000 (as adjusted in
      accordance with Plan Section 2.01(h)); or after the date the Employee's
      participation in the Plan has been expressly terminated by the Plan
      Administrator unless and until both the Plan Administrator reverses that
      decision and the Employee otherwise qualifies as an Eligible Employee."

4.    By deleting Section 2.01(h) in its entirety and by substituting therefor
the following:

      "(h)   The  term `Eligible Employee' means, prior to January 1, 1994, an
             individual employed on a full-time basis by the Company or one or
             more of its subsidiaries who has earned at least 850 HAY points,
             has been credited with at least three (3) `Years of Service,' as
             defined under the Morrison Incorporated Retirement Plan and has
             been selected for participation by the Plan Administrator and,
             after December 31, 1993, an individual employed on a full-time
             basis by the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries who earned
             an average salary, plus bonus, of at least $120,000 (or such
             greater amount as may be determined by the Plan Administrator from
             time to time) during the last two (2) Plan Years immediately
             preceding the first day of the Plan Year in which an Eligible
             Employee becomes a Participant and who has completed at least five
             (5) full years of consecutive service, on a calendar-year basis
             or otherwise, during which the Employee has held one or more
             Qualifying Positions."

5.    By deleting the second sentence of the first paragraph of Section
2.01(i) and by substituting therefor the following:

      "If the Participant retires, terminates employment or ceases to accrue
      Continuous Service in accordance with Plan Section 2.01(f), his Annual
      Base Salary for the final partial year of participation shall be
      annualized for purposes of calculating Final Base Salary."

6.    By deleting the second sentence of Section 2.01(k) and by substituting
therefor the following:

      "An Eligible Employee shall become a Participant as of the January 1st
      immediately following the date the eligibility criteria stated in Plan
      Section 2.01(h) are satisfied.  Upon retirement, termination of
      employment or cessation of the accrual of Continuous Service in
      accordance with Plan Section 2.01(f), a Participant's status shall
      become that of a former Participant."

7.    By substituting the name "Morrison Restaurants Inc. Executive
Supplemental Pension Plan" for the name "Morrison Incorporated Executive
Supplemental Pension Plan" in Section 2.01(l).

8.    By adding new Section 2.01(l)(l), immediately after Section 2.01(l), as
follows:

      "(l)(l)      The term `Plan Administrator' shall mean the organization
                   or person designated to administer the Plan by the Board of
                   Directors or, in lieu of any such designation, the
                   Company." 

9.    By deleting the first sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.01(n)
and by substituting therefor the following:

      "The date of calculation will be the retirement date, termination date
      or date of the cessation of the accrual of Continuous Service in
      accordance with Plan Section 2.01(f), whichever is applicable."

10.   By adding new Section 2.01(o) as follows:

      "(o)  "Qualifying Position" means one or more of the positions within
      the Company's organizational hierarchy identified in Appendix A hereto,
      as the same may be amended from time to time hereafter by the Chief
      Executive Officer of the Company.

11.   By deleting Article VII in its entirety and by substituting therefor the
following:

      "VIII.       ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

             A.    Operation of the Plan Administrator  The Company shall be
      the Plan Administrator, unless it appoints another Plan Administrator. 
      If an organization is appointed to serve as the Plan Administrator, then
      the Plan Administrator may designate in writing a person who may act on
      behalf of the Plan Administrator.  The Company shall have the right to
      remove the Plan Administrator at any time by notice in writing.  The
      Plan Administrator may resign at any time by written notice of
      resignation to the Company.  Upon removal or resignation, or in the
      event of the dissolution of the Plan Administrator, the Company shall
      appoint a successor.

             B.    Duties of the Plan Administrator

                   1.     The Plan Administrator shall perform any act which the
             Plan authorizes or requires of the Plan Administrator by action
             taken in compliance with the Plan and may designate in writing
             other persons to carry out its duties under the Plan.  The Plan
             Administrator may employ persons to render advice with regard to
             any of the Plan Administrator's duties.

                   2.     The Plan Administrator shall from time to time
             establish rules, not contrary to the provisions of the Plan, for
             the administration of the Plan and the transaction of its
             business.  All elections and designations under the Plan by a
             participating Employee or beneficiary shall be made on forms
             prescribed by the Plan Administrator.  The Plan Administrator
             shall have discretionary authority to construe the terms of the
             Plan and shall determine all questions arising in the
             administration, interpretation and application of the Plan,
             including, but not limited to, those concerning eligibility for
             benefits and it shall not act so as to discriminate in favor of
             any person.  All determinations of the Plan Administrator shall
             be conclusive and binding on all Employees and beneficiaries,
             subject to the provisions of the Plan and subject to applicable
             law.

                   3.     The Plan Administrator shall furnish Employees and
             Beneficiaries with all disclosures now or hereafter required by
             the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
             ("ERISA").  The Plan Administrator shall file, as required, the
             various reports and disclosures concerning the Plan and its
             operations as required by ERISA and by the Internal Revenue Code,
             and shall be solely responsible for establishing and maintaining
             all records of the Plan.

                   4.     The statement of specific duties for a Plan
             Administrator in this Section are not in derogation of any other
             duties which a Plan Administrator has under the provisions of the
             Plan or under applicable law.

                   5.     The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each
             person constituting the Plan Administrator from and against any
             and all claims and expenses (including, without limitation,
             attorney's fees and related costs) arising in connection with the
             performance by the person of his or her duties in that capacity,
             other than any of the foregoing arising in connection with the
             willful neglect or willful misconduct of the person acting.

             C.    Action by the Company   Any action to be taken by the
      Company shall be taken by resolution or written direction duly adopted
      by the Board or appropriate governing body, as the case may be;
      provided, however, that by such resolution or written direction, the
      Board or appropriate governing body, as the case may be, may delegate
      to any officer or other appropriate person of the Company the authority
      to take any such actions as may be specified in such resolution or
      written direction, other than the power to amend or terminate the Plan
      or to determine the basis of any payment obligations of the Company.

             D.    CLAIM REVIEW PROCEDURE

                   1.     In the event that an Employee or beneficiary is denied
             a claim for benefits under the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall
             provide to such claimant written notice of the denial which shall
             set forth:

                          a.    the specific reasons for the denial;

                          b.    specific references to the pertinent provisions
                   of the Plan on which the denial is based;

                          c.    a description of any additional material or
                   information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim
                   and an explanation of why such material or information is
                   necessary; and

                          d.    an explanation of the Plan's claim review
                   procedure.

                   2.     After receiving written notice of the denial of a
             claim, a claimant or his or her representative may:

                          a.    request a full and fair review of such denial
                   by written application to the Plan Administrator;

                          b.    review pertinent documents; and

                          c.    submit issues and comments in writing to the
                   Plan Administrator.

                   3.     If the claimant wishes such a review of the decision
             denying his or her claim to benefits under the Plan, he or she
             must submit such written applications to the Plan Administrator
             within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the
             denial.

                   4.     Upon receiving such written application for review,
             the Plan Administrator may schedule a hearing for purposes of
             reviewing the claimant's claim, which hearing shall take place not
             more than thirty (30) days from the date on which the Plan
             Administrator received such written application for review.

                   5.     At least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing,
             the claimant and his or her representative designated in writing
             by him or her, if any, shall receive written notice of the date,
             time, and place of such scheduled hearing.  The claimant or his
             or her representative, if any, may request that the hearing be
             rescheduled, for his or her convenience, on another reasonable
             date or at another reasonable time or place.

                   6.     All claimants requesting a review of the decision
             denying their claim for benefits may employ counsel for purposes
             of the hearing.

                   7.     No later than sixty (60) days following the receipt
             of the written application for review, the Plan Administrator
             shall submit its decision on the review in writing to the claimant
             involved and to his or her representative, if any; provided,
             however, a decision on the written application for review may be
             extended, in the event special circumstances such as the need to
             hold a hearing require an extension of time, to a day no later
             than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of receipt of
             the written application for review.  The decision shall include
             specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the
             pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based.

      Except as specifically provided herein, the Plan shall remain in full
force and effect as prior to this First Amendment.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this First Amendment
to be executed as the day and year first above written.

                           SECTION 3
                      DEFERRAL ELECTIONS

     3.1  Each Plan Year, a Member who is an Eligible Employee and (a) who
is not eligible to participate in the Salary Deferral Plan may elect to defer
under the Plan a portion of the Annual Compensation otherwise payable to him
for the Plan Year, which amount shall be at least two percent (2%) of Annual
Compensation and shall be in increments of one percent (1%) of Annual
Compensation, but not in excess of twenty percent (20%) of Annual
Compensation, or (b) who also is eligible to participate in the Salary
Deferral Plan for all or any portion of the Plan Year, shall indicate on the
election form completed as a participant in the Salary Deferral Plan whether
he elects to defer under the Plan that portion of the Annual Compensation
otherwise payable to him for the Plan Year which can not be deferred under
the Salary Deferral Plan because of one or more of the following limitations:
(i) Section 3.1(a) of the Salary Deferral Plan (reflecting a limit on salary
deferrals by "highly compensated employees," within the meaning of Code
Section 414(q)); (ii) Section 3.1(b) of the Salary Deferral Plan (relating
to the annual limit on salary deferrals set forth in Code Section 402(g));
(iii) Section 1.5 of the Salary Deferral Plan (relating to the limit on
includable compensation as set forth in Code Section 401(a)(17); or
(iv) Appendix B of the Salary Deferral Plan (relating to the limit on "annual
additions," within the meaning of Code Section 415.  Any election made
pursuant to Plan Section 3.1(b) shall automatically revoke any election then
in effect pursuant to Plan Section 3.1(a).

     3.2  All elections to defer Annual Compensation under Plan
Section 3.1(a) may only be made pursuant to a written agreement between the
Member and the Plan Sponsor which shall be in such form and subject to such
rules and limitations as the Plan Administrator may prescribe and shall
specify the amount of the Annual Compensation of the Member that the Member
desires to defer.  The written agreement shall be irrevocable with respect
to the first payroll period or bonus payment for which it becomes effective,
although it may be modified, revoked or suspended for subsequent payroll
periods or bonus payments in accordance with this Section 3.2 and subject to
such rules and limitations as the Plan Administrator may prescribe. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such election may be modified, revoked or
suspended only once each calendar quarter, and a Member who revokes or
suspends his election may not reenter the Plan until the next Entry Date
following twenty (20) days after the Member notifies the Plan Administrator
of recommencement.  With respect to base salary included in Annual
Compensation, the election to defer must be made before the services for
which the Annual Compensation is payable are performed.  With respect to any
bonus payments included in Annual Compensation, the election to defer must
be made before the amount of the bonus payment is determinable and payable.

     3.3  (a)  Each Plan Sponsor proposes to credit on behalf of each
     Member employed by that Plan Sponsor for allocation to that Member's
     Company Matching Account an amount equal to (X) reduced by (Y) where:

               (i)  (X) is an amount equal to (A) twenty percent (20%) of
          the Aggregate Deferral Amounts of a Member in the case of a
          Member who has been employed by a Plan Sponsor for at least
          three (3) years, but fewer than ten (10) years; (B) thirty
          percent (30%) of the Aggregate Deferral Amounts of a Member in
          the case of a Member who has been employed by a Plan Sponsor for
          at least ten (10) years, but fewer than twenty (20) years; or
          (C) forty percent (40%) of the Aggregate Deferral Amounts of a
          Member in the case of a Member who either (I) has been employed
          by a Plan Sponsor for at least twenty (20) years or (II) is
          designated by the Plan Administrator, with the consent of the
          Plan Sponsor, as one of a select group of Members to receive
          such a matching credit; and

               (ii)  (Y) is the matching contribution actually credited
          to the Member for the same period under the Salary Deferral
          Plan.

     Matching credits under Section 3.3(a)(i) for any Plan Year shall only
     be credited with respect to annual Aggregate Deferral Amounts of each
     Member equal to the Code Section 402(g) limitation, as adjusted
     annually for inflation.

          (b)  For purposes of determining matching amounts to be credited
     to a Member's Company Matching Account under Plan Section 3.3(a)(i),
     all or a portion of a Member's years of employment with a predecessor
     employer may be counted if at the time the individual became an
     Employee, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Plan Sponsor adopts
     resolutions providing for the counting of such years of employment in
     favor of that Member or of a group or category of individuals that
     included the Member.  The counting of any such years of employment
     shall be specified in those resolutions and shall be subject to such
     conditions, if any, provided therein.


                           SECTION 4
                      CREDITING ACCOUNTS

     4.1  As of each Valuation Date, Deferral Amounts previously elected
by a Member shall be credited to the Member's Employee Deferred Account.

     4.2  As of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year or any earlier
Valuation Dates as may be selected by the Plan Administrator, the amounts to
be credited for the applicable period pursuant to Plan Section 3.2 on behalf
of a Member shall be credited to the Member's Company Matching Account. 

     4.3  (a)  As of each Valuation Date, each Member's Company Matching
     Account (other than any Member who has received a distribution of his
     Accrued Benefit prior to that Valuation Date) shall be credited with
     a Company Stock Rate of Return based upon the amount credited to the
     Member's Company Matching Account as of the immediately preceding
     Valuation Date.

          (b)  As of each Valuation Date, each Member's Employee Deferred
     Account (other than any Member who has received a distribution of his
     Accrued Benefit prior to that Valuation Date) or portions thereof shall
     be credited with a designated rate or rates of return, as applicable,
     as selected by the Member, based upon the amount credited to the
     Member's Employee Deferred Account as of the immediately preceding
     Valuation Date.  A Member's Employee Deferred Account may be credited
     with such rate or rates of return in accordance with the most recent
     investment election properly and timely filed by the Member with the
     Plan Administrator in accordance with such rules and procedures
     designated by the Primary Sponsor.  If no election has been properly
     or timely filed with the Plan Administrator or if the Plan
     Administrator suspends the election of rates of return by Members, the
     Member's Employee Deferred Account or Members' Employee Deferred
     Accounts, as applicable, shall be credited with a designated rate of
     return selected by the Primary Sponsor.  Any selection of designated
     rates of return by Reporting Persons shall be subject to the
     restriction of Plan Section 4.3(d).

          (c)   As of the last day of any Plan Year, each Member's
     Employee Deferred Account (other than any Member who has received a
     distribution of his Accrued Benefit prior thereto) may be credited by
     the Plan Sponsor with an additional amount as may be determined by the
     Plan Sponsor in its sole discretion.

          (d)  No Reporting Person shall be eligible to select a Company
     Stock Rate of Return with respect to any portion of his Employee
     Deferred Account.  If any Member becomes a Reporting Person during a
     Plan Year and that Member then has in effect a Company Stock Rate of
     Return for any portion of his Employee Deferred Account, that portion
     of the Member's Employee Deferred Account shall be credited with the
     Company Stock Rate of Return for the portion of the Plan Year ending
     with the Valuation Date immediately prior to the Member's becoming a
     Reporting Person and, for the remainder of the Plan Year or until such
     earlier time as the Member elects an alternative designated rate of
     return, the rate of return (among those designated rates of return made
     available by the Plan Administrator for the Plan Year, other than the
     Company Stock Rate of Return) earning the lowest return for the Plan
     Year.


                           SECTION 5
                       HARDSHIP PAYMENTS

     5.1  The Plan Administrator may pay all or a portion of a Member's
Deferral Amounts (reduced by negative rates of return experienced) prior to
the time such amounts otherwise become payable in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that any such distribution shall
be made only if the Member is an Employee and demonstrates that he is
suffering from "Hardship," as that term is defined under the Salary Deferral
Plan, as amended, and any other unforeseeable circumstance determined to
constitute a "Hardship"for purposes of this Section by the Plan
Administrator.  For purposes of this Section, the Plan Administrator shall
have the sole and absolute discretion, which shall be exercised in a
nondiscriminatory and uniform manner, to determine if a "Hardship" exists
with respect to a Member.
 
     5.2  Hardship payments shall be made to a Member only in accordance
with such rules, policies, procedures, restrictions, and conditions as the
Plan Administrator may from time to time adopt.  Any determination of the
amount to be distributed on account of a Hardship shall be made by the Plan
Administrator in accordance with rules applied in a uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner.  A payment under this Section shall be made in a
lump sum in cash to the Member and shall be charged against the Member's
Employee Deferred Account as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or
immediately preceding the date of the payment. 

     5.3  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Member who receives a payment
of all or any portion of his Employee Deferred Account pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall be suspended from making deferrals under Plan Section 3 for
the calendar year immediately following the date the Member receives a
payment under this Section 5.3.


                           SECTION 6
                        DEATH BENEFITS

     6.1  Upon the death of a Member who dies prior to the date on which
he is entitled to the commencement of payments of his Account, the Member's
Beneficiary shall be entitled to the full value of the Member's Account.

     6.2  Upon the death of a Member who is no longer an Employee, but
prior to the complete payment of his Account, the Member's Beneficiary shall
be entitled to receive the unpaid portion of the Member's Account.  These
payments shall be made according to the manner and method by which payments
were being made to the Member during his lifetime, except as provided by Plan
Section 6.4.

     6.3  If, subsequent to the death of a Member, the Member's Beneficiary
dies while entitled to receive benefits under the Plan, the successor
Beneficiary, if any, or the Beneficiary listed under Subsection (a), (b) or
(c) of the Plan Section containing the definition of the term "Beneficiary"
shall generally be entitled to receive benefits under the Plan.  However, if
the deceased Beneficiary was the Member's spouse at the time of the Member's
death, or if no successor Beneficiary shall have been designated by the
Member and be alive and no Beneficiary listed under Subsection (a), (b) or
(c) of the Plan Section containing the definition of the term "Beneficiary"
shall be alive, the Member's unpaid vested Accrued Benefit shall be paid to
the personal representative of the deceased Beneficiary's estate.

     6.4  If the Beneficiary is the estate of the Member, the Plan Sponsor
shall make payment of the unpaid balance of the Member's Account in the form
of a single lump-sum payment equal to the unpaid balance of the Member's
Account as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding payment.

     6.5  Any benefit payable under this Section 6 shall be paid in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of Plan Section 7 after receipt
by the Plan Administrator of notice of the death of the Member.


                           SECTION 7
          PAYMENT OF BENEFITS ON RETIREMENT OR DEATH

     7.1  Upon the retirement or death of a Member, the Accrued Benefit of
the Member shall be determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or
immediately preceding the Member's Retirement Date or death, increased by
Deferral Amounts and amounts credited pursuant to Plan Section 3.2(a)
thereafter and adjusted for the appropriate designated rates of return and
any other amounts credited pursuant to Plan Section 3.2(c) through the
Valuation Date immediately preceding the date the Accrued Benefit is paid. 
Payment of the Member's Accrued Benefit shall commence no later than sixty
(60) days after the Retirement Date or death of the Member.

     7.2  The form of payment of the Accrued Benefit of a Member shall be
selected by the Plan Administrator and shall be in either a lump sum or
annual or more frequent installments.  13
The payment of a Member's Accrued Benefit shall be in cash or such other
property as determined by the Primary Sponsor; except that on or after a
Change of Control, payment of a Member's Accrued Benefit shall be in cash. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Accrued Benefit of any Member who is or
was a Reporting Person at any time within six (6) months prior to the date
that his Accrued Benefit is paid shall be paid in cash.


                           SECTION 8
    PAYMENT OF BENEFITS ON OTHER TERMINATIONS OF EMPLOYMENT

     8.1  A Member shall be considered to have terminated employment with
the Plan Sponsor or any Affiliate on the date determined by the Plan
Administrator.  Transfer of a Member from one Plan Sponsor to another Plan
Sponsor shall not be deemed for any purpose under the Plan to be a
termination of employment by the Member.

     8.2  In the event of the termination of employment of a Member for
reasons other than those specified in Sections 6 and 7 above, the Accrued
Benefit of the Member shall be determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding
with or immediately preceding the date of the termination of employment and
shall be increased by any Deferral Amounts credited to the Employee Deferred
Account of the Member since that Valuation Date.  While no further amounts
credited pursuant to Plan Section 3.2(a) shall be made to the Member's
Account after that Valuation Date, the Member's Account shall be adjusted for
the appropriate designated rates of return and any other amounts credited
pursuant to Plan Section 3.2(c) through the Valuation Date immediately
preceding the date the Accrued Benefit is paid.

     8.3  A Member shall be entitled to payment of his Accrued Benefit in
the form set forth in Plan Section 7.2.  Payment shall commence at any time
which the Plan Administrator may select following termination of employment,
which shall not be later than sixty (60) days after the end of the Plan Year
in which the Member attains age 65.  


                           SECTION 9
                  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

     9.1  Operation of the Plan Administrator.  The Primary Sponsor shall
be the Plan Administrator, unless it appoints another Plan Administrator. 
If an organization is appointed to serve as the Plan Administrator, then the
Plan Administrator may designate in writing a person who may act on behalf
of the Plan Administrator.  The Primary Sponsor shall have the right to
remove the Plan Administrator at any time by notice in writing.  The Plan
Administrator may resign at any time by written notice or resignation to the
Primary Sponsor.  Upon removal or resignation, or in the event of the
dissolution of the Plan Administrator, the Primary Sponsor shall appoint a
successor.

     9.2  Duties of the Plan Administrator.

          (a)  The Plan Administrator shall perform any act which the Plan
     authorizes or requires of the Plan Administrator by action taken in
     compliance with the Plan and may designate in writing other persons to
     carry out its duties under the Plan.  The Plan Administrator may employ
     persons to render advice with regard to any of the Plan Administrator's
     duties.

          (b)  The Plan Administrator shall from time to time establish
     rules, not contrary to the provisions of the Plan, for the
     administration of the Plan and the transaction of its business.  All
     elections and designations under the Plan by a Member or Beneficiary
     shall be made on forms prescribed by the Plan Administrator.  The Plan
     Administrator shall have discretionary authority to construe the terms
     of the Plan and shall determine all questions arising in the
     administration, interpretation and application of the Plan, including,
     but not limited to, those concerning eligibility for benefits and it
     shall not act so as to discriminate in favor of any person.  All
     determinations of the Plan Administrator shall be conclusive and
     binding on all Members and Beneficiaries, subject to the provisions of
     the Plan and subject to applicable law.

          (c)  The Plan Administrator shall furnish Members and
     Beneficiaries with all disclosures now or hereafter required by the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). 
     The Plan Administrator shall file, as required, the various reports and
     disclosures concerning the Plan and its operations as required by ERISA
     and by the Code, and shall be solely responsible for establishing and
     maintaining all records of the Plan.

          (d)  The statement of specific duties for a Plan Administrator
     in this Section is not in derogation of any other duties which a Plan
     Administrator has under the provisions of the Plan or under applicable
     law.

          (e)  Each Plan Sponsor shall indemnify and hold harmless each
     person constituting the Plan Administrator from and against any and all
     claims and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and
     related costs) arising in connection with the performance by the person
     of his duties in that capacity, other than any of the foregoing arising
     in connection with the willful neglect or willful misconduct of the
     person acting.

     8.3  Action by the Primary Sponsor or a Plan Sponsor.  Any action to
be taken by the Primary Sponsor or a Plan Sponsor shall be taken by
resolution or written direction duly adopted by its board of directors or
appropriate governing body, as the case may be; provided, however, that by
such resolution or written direction, the board of directors or appropriate
governing body, as the case may be, may delegate to any officer or other
appropriate person of a Plan Sponsor the authority to take any such actions
as may be specified in such resolution or written direction, other than the
power to amend, modify or terminate the Plan or to determine the basis of any
payment obligations of any Plan Sponsor.


                          SECTION 10
                    CLAIM REVIEW PROCEDURE

     10.1 In the event that a Member or Beneficiary is denied a claim for
benefits under a Plan, the Plan Administrator shall provide to such claimant
written notice of the denial which shall set forth:

          (a)  the specific reasons for the denial;

          (b)  specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan
     on which the denial is based;

          (c)  a description of any additional material or information
     necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
     why such material or information is necessary; and

          (d)  an explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.

     10.2 After receiving written notice of the denial of a claim, a
claimant or his representative may:

          (a)  request a full and fair review of such denial by written
     application to the Plan Administrator;

          (b)  review pertinent documents; and

          (c)  submit issues and comments in writing to the Plan
     Administrator.

     10.3 If the claimant wishes such a review of the decision denying his
claim to benefits under the Plan, he must submit such written applications
to the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after receiving written
notice of the denial.

     10.4 Upon receiving such written application for review, the Plan
Administrator may schedule a hearing for purposes of reviewing the claimant's
claim, which hearing shall take place not more than thirty (30) days from the
date on which the Plan Administrator received such written application for
review.

     10.5 At least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the
claimant and his representative designated in writing by him, if any, shall
receive written notice of the date, time, and place of such scheduled
hearing.  The claimant or his representative, if any, may request that the
hearing be rescheduled, for his convenience, on another reasonable date or
at another reasonable time or place.

     10.6 All claimants requesting a review of the decision denying their
claim for benefits may employ counsel for purposes of the hearing.

     10.7 No later than sixty (60) days following the receipt of the
written application for review, the Plan Administrator shall submit its
decision on the review in writing to the claimant involved and to his
representative, if any; provided, however, a decision on the written
application for review may be extended, in the event special circumstances
such as the need to hold a hearing require an extension of time, to a day no
later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of receipt of the
written application for review.  The decision shall include specific reasons
for the decision and specific references to the pertinent provisions of the
Plan on which the decision is based.


                          SECTION 11
         LIMITATION OF ASSIGNMENT, PAYMENTS TO LEGALLY
        INCOMPETENT DISTRIBUTEE AND UNCLAIMED PAYMENTS

     11.1 No benefit which shall be payable under the Plan to any person
shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall
be void; and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable for, or subject
to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person,
nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for, or against, such
person, and the same shall not be recognized under the Plan, except to such
extent as may be required by law.

     11.2 If any person who shall be entitled to any benefit under the Plan
shall become bankrupt or shall attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge such benefit under the Plan,
then the payment of any such benefit in the event a Member or Beneficiary is
entitled to payment shall, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, cease
and terminate and in that event the Plan Administrator shall hold or apply
the same for the benefit of such person, his spouse, children, other
dependents or any of them in such manner and in such proportion as the Plan
Administrator shall determine.

     11.3 Whenever any benefit which shall be payable under the Plan is to
be paid to or for the benefit of any person who is then a minor or determined
to be incompetent by qualified medical advice, the Plan Administrator need
not require the appointment of a guardian or custodian, but shall be
authorized to cause the same to be paid over to the person having custody of
such minor or incompetent, or to cause the same to be paid to such minor or
incompetent without the intervention of a guardian or custodian, or to cause
the same to be paid to a legal guardian or custodian of such minor or
incompetent if one has been appointed or to cause the same to be used for the
benefit of such minor or incompetent.

     11.4 Whenever the Plan Administrator cannot, within a reasonable time
after payments are to commence, locate any person to or for the benefit of
whom such payments are to be made, after making a reasonable effort to locate
such person, the Plan Administrator may direct that the payment and any
remaining payments otherwise due to the Member be cancelled on the records
of the Plan, except that in the event the Member later notifies the Plan
Administrator of his whereabouts and requests the payments due to him under
the Plan, the Plan Sponsor shall re-credit the Member's account and provide
for payment of the re-credited amount to the Member as soon as
administratively feasible.



                          SECTION 12
                     LIMITATION OF RIGHTS

     Membership in the Plan shall not give any Employee any right or claim
except to the extent that such right is specifically fixed under the terms
of the Plan.  The adoption of the Plan by any Plan Sponsor shall not be
construed to give any Employee a right to be continued in the employ of a
Plan Sponsor or as interfering with the right of a Plan Sponsor to terminate
the employment of any Employee at any time.


                          SECTION 13
            AMENDMENT TO OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

     13.1 The Primary Sponsor reserves the right at any time to modify or
amend or terminate the Plan.  No such modifications or amendments shall have
the effect of retroactively changing or depriving Members or Beneficiaries
of benefits already accrued under the Plan.  No Plan Sponsor other than the
Primary Sponsor shall have the right to so modify, amend or terminate the
Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Plan Sponsor may terminate its own
participation in the Plan.

     13.2 Each Plan Sponsor other than the Primary Sponsor shall have the
right to terminate its participation in the Plan by resolution of its board
of directors or other appropriate governing body and notice in writing to the
Primary Sponsor.  Any termination by a Plan Sponsor shall not be a
termination as to any other Plan Sponsor.

     13.3 If the Plan is terminated by the Primary Sponsor it shall
terminate as to all Plan Sponsors.


                          SECTION 14
                ADOPTION OF PLAN BY AFFILIATES

     Any corporation or other business entity related to the Primary Sponsor
by function or operation and any Affiliate, if the corporation, business
entity or Affiliate is authorized to do so by written direction adopted by
the Board of Directors, may adopt the Plan by action of the board of
directors or other appropriate governing body of such corporation, business
entity or Affiliate.  Any adoption shall be evidenced by certified copies of
the resolutions of the foregoing board of directors 
or governing body indicating the adoption by the adopting corporation, or
business entity or Affiliate.  The resolution shall state and define the
Effective Date of the adoption of the Plan by the Plan Sponsor.


                          SECTION 15
                         MISCELLANEOUS

     15.1 All payments provided under the Plan shall be paid from the
general assets of the applicable Plan Sponsor and no separate fund shall be
established to secure payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Primary
Sponsor may establish a grantor trust to assist it and other Plan Sponsors
in funding Plan obligations, and any payments made to a Member or Beneficiary
from such trust shall relieve the Plan Sponsor from any further obligations
under the Plan only to the extent of such payment.

     15.2 Each Plan Sponsor shall withhold from any benefits payable under
the Plan all federal, state and local income taxes or other taxes required
to be withheld pursuant to applicable law.

     15.3 To the extent not preempted by applicable federal law, the Plan
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Alabama.


     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Primary Sponsor has caused this indenture to
be executed as of the date first above written.

                        TRUST AGREEMENT



     THIS TRUST AGREEMENT made as of the  1   day of  December , 1992, by
and among Morrison Restaurants Inc., formerly Morrison Incorporated, a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Primary
Sponsor"), each related corporation or business executing this Trust
Agreement (the Primary Sponsor and each related corporation or business being
sometimes hereinafter referred to as a "Plan Sponsor"); and AmSouth Bank N.A.
(the "Trustee");


                     W I T N E S S E T H:


     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor by indenture effective as of January 1,
1988 established the Morrison Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan to
provide benefits in the form of deferred compensation to a select group of
management or highly compensated employees of the Primary Sponsor or any of
its related corporations or businesses; and

     WHEREAS, the Morrison Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan has been
renamed the Morrison Restaurants Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the
"Plan"); and

     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor by agreement dated June 16, 1988
established an irrevocable grantor trust (the "Trust"), within the meaning
of Section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
to assist the Primary Sponsor and any of its related corporations or
businesses in meeting its obligations under the Plan; and

     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor desires to amend and restate the trust
agreement between the Primary Sponsor and AmSouth Bank N.A., dated as of May
1, 1990 and last amended by indenture dated May 8, 1992, which agreement, as
amended, contains the existing terms of the Trust (the "Prior Trust
Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Primary Sponsor has approved the
amendment and restatement of the Prior Trust Agreement as embodied herein
(the "Trust Agreement");

     NOW, THEREFORE, the Primary Sponsor hereby restates the Trust,
effective as of January 1, 1993, as follows: 


                          SECTION 1.

                     INCORPORATION OF PLAN

     All terms and conditions set forth in the Plan are incorporated by
reference except to the extent that the terms of the Trust indicate to the
contrary.  In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of the
Trust Agreement and those the Plan, the terms and provisions of the Trust
Agreement shall be given precedence.  However, nothing contained in the Trust
Agreement is intended to diminish the amount of benefits required to be paid
for the benefit of any participant under the terms of the Plan.  To the
extent possible, the terms and provisions of the Plan and those of the Trust
Agreement shall be interpreted as mutually consistent.

                          SECTION 2.

                   ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FUND

     The Primary Sponsor has established a fund with the Trustee (the
"Fund") to be held and administered in accordance with this Trust.  The
Trustee shall accept as part of the Fund all assets as may be delivered by
a Plan Sponsor to the Trustee and shall also include all income accruing
thereon, except as otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement.

                          SECTION 3.

                    INVESTMENT OF THE FUND

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of Subsections (b) and (c) below, the
Trustee shall invest the principal and income of the Fund without distinction
between principal and income in securities or in property, real or personal
and wherever situated, as the Trustee shall deem advisable, in its sole
discretion.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Trustee may purchase,
acquire, retain, sell, transfer, pledge or encumber common or preferred
stocks, including stock of the Primary Sponsor or any affiliate, shares of
mutual funds, including mutual funds for which the Trustee is an advisor,
trust and participation certificates, bonds and mortgages, other evidences
of indebtedness or ownership, annuity contracts and ordinary and term life
insurance contracts of life insurance companies, savings accounts or plans,
including savings accounts or plans established or to be established by the
Trustee, and group trusts or collective investment funds including group
trusts or collective investment funds operated by the Trustee.

     (b)   The Fund shall be invested by the Trustee with the goal of
achieving on an annual basis an average rate of return that equals or exceeds
the weighted average of those designated rates of return to be credited to
Accounts for the same period, as contemplated by Plan Section 4.3 and
identified by the Primary Sponsor from time to time (the "Investment Goal"). 
The Trustee shall incur no liability merely for a failure to achieve the
Investment Goal for any period; provided that during the period the Fund was
invested in accordance with applicable fiduciary standards and with a view
towards achieving the Investment Goal.

     (c)  Prior to the date a Change of Control (as defined in Section
13(c) hereof) occurs, the Primary Sponsor, and on or after the date a Change
of Control occurs, the Trustee, may appoint one or more investment managers
(the "Investment Managers") which shall be banks, investment advisers
registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or insurance companies,
to direct the Trustee as to the investment of all or a portion of the Fund
for the exclusive benefit of the participants of the Plans and their
beneficiaries.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date a Change of
Control occurs, the Primary Sponsor may appoint the Trustee (or any of its
affiliates) as an Investment Manager, if it is otherwise qualified to serve
as an Investment Manager and in such instance, the Trustee shall have
discretion over the investment of the Fund, subject to the provisions of
Subsection (b) above.

     The Primary Sponsor shall notify the Trustee of the appointment of any
Investment Manager (other than the Trustee) under this Subsection by
delivering to the Trustee (i) an executed copy of an instrument under which
the Investment Manager was appointed to act hereunder and setting forth the
investment powers of the Investment Manager and (ii) a written instrument
executed by the Investment Manager in which it acknowledges that it has
agreed to act as such.  Any notice of appointment pursuant to this Subsection
shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Primary Sponsor that
the Investment Manager is qualified under and has been appointed in
accordance with the provisions hereof.  Notwithstanding anything herein
contained to the contrary, during the term of its appointment, the Investment
Manager shall have the sole responsibility for the investment and
reinvestment of the portion of the Fund for which it was appointed to act,
and, subject to the limitations on the types of appropriate investments set
forth in Subsection (b) hereof, shall have full power in its discretion to
direct the Trustee with respect to the exercise by it of its investment
powers, including the voting of shares (except as otherwise provided by
Section 13(d) hereof).  Pending receipt of instructions from any Investment
Manager with respect thereto and subject to any investment guidelines agreed
to in writing from time to time pursuant to Subsection (b) hereof, any cash
received by the Trustee from time to time shall be invested by the Trustee
in demand and term notes (including those commonly known as "master notes")
maturing not more than three years after the date of purchase thereof, United
States Treasury bills, other government and agency obligations maturing not
more than three years after the date of purchase thereof, group annuity or
other contracts providing a guaranteed rate of return with a maturity not
exceeding three years, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government
guaranteed paper, common or collective trust funds, money market mutual
funds, other money market instruments, savings accounts or other deposits
with a financial institution (including the Trustee, if a financial
institution is serving as such) and part interests in any one or more of the
foregoing.
 
     The Primary Sponsor may terminate its appointment of an Investment
Manager at any time and shall in writing notify the Trustee of such
termination, and may thereafter appoint a successor Investment Manager in the
same manner as provided above in this Subsection.  Any successor Investment
Manager shall thereafter, until its appointment is terminated, be deemed to
be an "Investment Manager" for all purposes of this Agreement.  If there
shall be more than one Investment Manager, the portion of the Fund to be
invested by each Investment Manager shall be held in a separate account and
the powers and authority of each Investment Manager shall be divided as set
forth in the instruments appointing such Investment Managers.

     So long as an Investment Manager (other than the Trustee or one of its
affiliates) is serving as such, the Trustee shall be under no duty or
obligation to review the assets comprising any portion of the Fund managed
by the Investment Manager, to make any recommendations with respect to the
investment or reinvestment thereof, or to determine whether any direction
received from any Investment Manager is proper or within the terms of this
Trust Agreement or to monitor the activities of any Investment Manager.

     (d)  The Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility to the
Primary Sponsor or any persons claiming any interest in the Fund for acting
without question on the direction of, or for failing to act in the absence
of any direction from, any Investment Manager unless the Trustee participated
knowingly in, or knowingly undertook to conceal, an act or omission of any
Investment Manager constituting a breach of its duties hereunder, knowing
such act or omission was a breach of such duties; provided, however, that the
Trustee shall not be deemed to have "participated" in a breach by any
Investment Manager for the purposes of this undertaking solely as a result
of the performance by the Trustee or its officers, employees or agents of any
custodial, reporting, recording, and bookkeeping functions with respect to
any assets of the Fund managed by any Investment Manager or solely as a
result of settling purchase and sale transactions entered into or directed
by any Investment Manager, or to have "knowledge" of any such breach solely
as a result of the information received by the Trustee or its officers,
employees or agents in the normal course in performing such functions or
settling such transactions.  If the Trustee has actual knowledge of a breach
committed by any Investment Manager, it shall promptly notify the Primary
Sponsor in writing thereof, and the Trustee, except as required by applicable
law, shall thereafter have no responsibility to remedy such breach.

     (e)  The Primary Sponsor may, prior to a Change of Control, direct the
Trustee in writing to transfer any portion of the Fund to a subtrustee and
to enter into an agreement with the subtrustee reflecting the subtrust
arrangement.  In the event of a Change of Control, the Primary Sponsor may
only direct the Trustee to transfer a portion of the Fund to a subtrustee
with the consent of a majority of the participants of the Plan and the
designated beneficiaries of deceased participants.  The Trustee may terminate
a subtrust at any time and direct the subtrustee to return the portion of the
Fund held by the subtrustee; provided that prior to a Change of Control the
subtrust may only be terminated with the consent of the Primary Sponsor.

                          SECTION 4.

                     POWERS OF THE TRUSTEE

                          SECTION 5.

                            FUNDING

     (a)  Payments to the Trustee by each Plan Sponsor shall be made as
follows:

           (i) Contributions shall be paid to the Trustee within a
reasonable period of time after the date that the Deferral Amounts otherwise
would have been paid to Members in an amount equal to (A) the aggregate
Deferral Amounts elected by Members for the period and (B) corresponding
amounts to be credited to Members' Company Matching Accounts under Plan
Section 3.2.

         (ii)  In the event that the designated rates of return to be
credited to Members' Accounts as of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year
exceed the aggregate net income, gains and credits of the Trust as of the
same Valuation Date, the Plan Sponsor shall make a contribution to the Trust
within a reasonable period of time after that Valuation Date in an amount
equal to the excess.  In the event that the designated rates of return and
other amounts to be credited to Members' Accounts pursuant to Plan
Section 4.3 as of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year are less than the
aggregate net income, gains and credits of the Trust as of the same Valuation
Date, the Trustee shall apply the difference as a credit towards future
contributions required of the Plan Sponsor pursuant to this Subsection (a),
unless the Primary Sponsor directs otherwise pursuant to Subsection (c)
below.

     (b)  The Trustee shall be responsible for assets actually received by
it as Trustee and shall have no duty or authority to compute amounts to be
contributed or to review the computation of amounts to be contributed.

     (c)  Prior to a Change of Control, the Primary Sponsor may from time
to time direct the Trustee to determine the amount by which the assets in the
Trust exceed the amount needed to pay all unpaid benefits accrued under the
Plan (the "Surplus Amount").  If the Trustee determines that the Trust has
a Surplus Amount, the Primary Sponsor may advise the Trustee that the Primary
Sponsor is entitled to receive the Surplus Amount.  The Trustee shall make
payment to the Primary Sponsor of the Surplus Amount as soon as
administratively practicable following receipt of the notification provided
for in this Subsection.

                          SECTION 6.

                    DUTIES OF THE TRUSTEE 

     (a)  Except for records dealing solely with the Trust and its
investments and disbursements, which shall be maintained by the Trustee, each
Plan Sponsor shall maintain all records contemplated by the Plan.

     (b)  Each Plan Sponsor shall furnish to the Trustee all the
information necessary to determine the benefits payable to or with respect
to each participant in the Plan, including any benefits payable after a
participant's death.  Each Plan Sponsor shall from time to time, and at least
annually, and promptly upon the request of the Trustee furnish updated
information to the Trustee.  In the event the Plan Sponsor refuses or
neglects to provide any updated information as contemplated herein, the
Trustee shall rely upon the most recent information furnished to it by the
Plan Sponsor; provided, however, that on or after a Change of Control, the
Trustee shall rely in its discretion upon (i) information furnished to it by
the Plan Sponsor prior to a Change of Control, (ii) information furnished to
it by the Plan Sponsor on or after a Change of Control and/or (iii) any
information received by it from a participant or designated beneficiary
unless the recipient actually knows that any such information is false.  The
Trustee has no responsibility to verify information provided to them by the
Plan Sponsor or any participant or designated beneficiary.

     (c)  Upon proper notification from the Plan Sponsor prior to a Change
of Control or upon an independent determination by the Trustee on or after
a Change of Control (based on such information as the Trustee shall be
entitled to rely upon pursuant to Subsection (b) above), when, in the opinion
of the Plan Sponsor prior to a Change of Control or Trustee on or after a
Change of Control, as applicable, a participant's benefits under the Plan
have become payable, the Plan Sponsor or Trustee, as applicable, shall notify
the participant or the beneficiary of a deceased participant and, if
applicable, the Trustee.  Such notice shall include the amount of such
benefits, the terms of payment, the amount of any taxes required to be
withheld from such amount, and the name, address and social security number
of the recipient.  Upon the receipt of a notification or after making its
determination, as applicable, the Trustee shall commence distributions from
the Fund in accordance therewith to the person or persons so indicated.

     (d)  The Plan Sponsors shall have full responsibility for the payment
of all taxes of any nature levied, assessed or imposed upon the Fund,
including the payment of all withholding taxes to the appropriate taxing
authority and shall also furnish each participant or beneficiary with the
appropriate tax information form evidencing such payment and the amount
thereof.

     (e)  Prior to a Change of Control, the Trustee shall have no
responsibility for determining whether any participant or beneficiary has
died or whether a participant's rights under the terms of the Plan have been
forfeited and shall be entitled to rely upon information furnished by the
Plan Sponsor.  On or after a Change of Control, the Trustee shall determine
whether a participant's benefit shall be deemed forfeited or whether a
participant or beneficiary has died based on information supplied under
Subsection (b) hereof; provided, however, that a certified death certificate
received by the Trustee shall be conclusive evidence of the death of any
person regardless of the source of such certificate.

     (f)  Nothing provided in this Trust Agreement shall relieve a Plan
Sponsor of its liabilities to pay the benefits provided under the Plan except
to the extent such liabilities are met by application of Fund assets.

     (g)  Each Plan Sponsor agrees that by the establishment of this Trust
it hereby forgoes forgoes any judicial review of any independent
determination by the Trustee as to the benefit payable to any persons
hereunder.  If a dispute arises as to the amounts or timing of any such
benefits or the persons entitled thereto under the Plans or this Trust
Agreement, the Plan Sponsor agrees that such dispute shall be resolved by
binding arbitration proceedings convened in Mobile, Alabama and conducted in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association and that
the results of such proceedings shall be conclusive and shall not be subject
to judicial review.  It is expressly understood that pending the resolution
of any such dispute, payment of benefits shall be made and continued by the
Trustee in accordance with its independent determination and that the Trustee
shall have no liability with respect to such payments.  The Plan Sponsor also
agrees to pay the entire cost of any arbitration or legal proceeding
initiated by it or by the Trustee or by any participant or beneficiary,
including the legal fees of the Trustee and the participant or other claimant
regardless of the outcome of any such proceeding.

                          SECTION 7.

                  DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE FUND

     (a)  Consistent with the provisions of Section 9 hereof, the Trustee
is authorized to pay from the Fund reasonable expenses of the Trustee,
including fees of accountants and legal counsel to the Trust, and the
Trustee's compensation.

     (b)  The Trustee shall make any distribution required pursuant to this
Trust Agreement by mailing its check or other evidence of payment to the
person to whom such distribution or payment is to be made at such address as
was last furnished to the Trustee or, if agreeable to the Plan Sponsor and
the affected participant and so directed in a written notice to the Trustee
by those parties, by crediting the account of such person or by transferring
funds to such person's account by bank or wire transfer.  The Trustee shall
not be required to make any investigation to determine the whereabouts or
mailing address of any person.  If the person to receive a distribution can
not be found, the Trustee shall hold payment or deposit same in a bank
(including the Trustee, if a financial institution is serving as such) for
the credit of that person without liability for interest thereon.  If a check
or other evidence of payment of the benefit hereunder has been mailed to the
last address of the person furnished the Trustee and is returned unclaimed,
the Trustee shall notify the Plan Sponsor and shall discontinue further
payments to the payee until it receives instructions from the Plan Sponsor.

     (c)  The Trustee shall not be bound by any instruction, direction or
notice unless and until it has been received in writing by the Trustee and
may rely upon any instruction, direction or notice of a continuing nature
until the Trustee receives a writing which revokes that instruction,
direction or notice.  The Trustee may without liability assume that any such
instruction, direction or notice is genuine unless it has actual knowledge
or, after receiving notification of a problem, has reasonably determined that
the instruction, direction or notice is not genuine.

     (d)  The Trustee shall not be responsible for the application of any
assets held as part of the Fund which have been distributed pursuant to the
Plan and the Trust Agreement.

                          SECTION 8.

                      CLAIMS OF CREDITORS

     (a)  The Fund assets shall be treated as general assets of the Plan
Sponsor and shall remain subject to claims of the general creditors of the
Plan Sponsor under applicable state and federal law.  Nothing in the Trust
Agreement shall affect the rights of any participant as general creditor of
the Plan Sponsor.  No participant shall have a preferred claim on or any
beneficial ownership in the Fund prior to the time for distribution to the
participant under the terms of a Plan or the terms of this Trust Agreement. 
In the event that the Plan Sponsor becomes insolvent as described in
Subsection (c) below, each participant shall be deemed to waive any priority
the participant may have under law as an employee with respect to any claim
against the Plan Sponsor and the Trust beyond the rights the participant
would have as a general creditor of the Plan Sponsor.

     (b)  Except as otherwise provided by Subsection (c) below, no benefit
which shall be payable under the Trust to any person shall be subject in any
manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of the same
shall be void.  No benefit shall in any manner be subject to the debts,
contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person, nor shall it be
subject to attachment or legal process for or against any person, except to
the extent provided by Subsection (c) below and as may otherwise be required
by law.

     (c)  The board of directors of a Plan Sponsor shall immediately notify
the Trustee in writing of the insolvency of the Plan Sponsor.  For purposes
of this Subsection (c), the term "insolvency" shall mean the inability of the
Plan Sponsor to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its
business or that the liabilities of the Plan Sponsor are in excess of its
assets.  Upon receipt of the written notice, the Trustee shall suspend all
further payments to participants or their beneficiaries and shall hold the
assets of the Trust for the benefit of the creditors of the Plan Sponsor in
the manner directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.  If the Trustee
should receive any written allegation of the insolvency of the Plan Sponsor,
the Trustee shall suspend payments to participants and hold the assets of the
Trust for the benefit of the creditors of the Plan Sponsor and, within a
period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of the written allegation,
determine whether the Plan Sponsor is insolvent.  If the Trustee determines
that the Plan Sponsor is solvent, it shall immediately resume payments to the
participants or their beneficiaries.  In the event that the Trustee has
actual knowledge of the insolvency of the Plan Sponsor, the Trustee shall
hold the assets of the Trust for the benefit of the creditors of the Plan
Sponsor in the manner directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Unless
the Trustee (i) has been notified in writing by the board of directors of a
Plan Sponsor of the insolvency of a Plan Sponsor, (ii) has received any
written allegation of the insolvency of a Plan Sponsor or (iii) has actual
knowledge of the insolvency of a Plan Sponsor, the Trustee shall have no duty
to inquire whether a Plan Sponsor is insolvent.

                          SECTION 9.

                       FEES AND EXPENSES

     The compensation and expenses of the Trustee shall be paid from the
assets of the Fund.  Expenses of the Trustee shall include the reasonable
expenses and compensation of third parties employed by the Trustee pursuant
to Section 4(f) hereof.

                          SECTION 10.

                           ACCOUNTS

     (a)  The Trustee shall keep such records as the Trustee considers
necessary for the management of the Trust.  The Trustee's books and records
of the Fund shall be open to inspection by the Plan Sponsor and participants
during regular business hours of the Trustee.

     (b)  The Trustee may establish separate accounts within the Fund for
any group or category of the Plan as it determines appropriate to maintain
its books of accounts and other records in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan and the Trust Agreement.  The Plan Sponsors shall maintain or cause
to be maintained accounting records for the Plan sufficient to allow the
determination of the portion of the Fund which is allocable both to each of
the Plan Sponsors.  Irrespective of the comingling of assets of the Plan for
investment in the Fund, no portion of the Fund which is allocable to any one
of the Plan Sponsors shall be used to pay benefits or discharge liabilities
or obligations specifically allocable or attributable, respectively, to any
other Plan or any other Plan Sponsor.

     (c)  Within ninety (90) days after the close of each calendar year,
the date of the removal or resignation of the Trustee, or the termination of
the Trust, the Trustee shall render to the Primary Sponsor a written account
of its management of the Fund covering the period since the previous account
and report.  The written approval of that accounting and report by the
Primary Sponsor or the failure of the Primary Sponsor to notify the Trustee
of its disapproval of such accounting within ninety (90) days after its
receipt shall be final and binding as to the Trustee's administration of the
Trust for the period upon the Primary Sponsor and all persons who have or may
thereafter have an interest in the Trust.

                          SECTION 11.

              RESIGNATION, REMOVAL AND SUCCESSION

     (a)  The Trustee may resign at any time upon giving sixty (60) days'
prior written notice to the Primary Sponsor.

     (b)  The Trustee may be removed by the Primary Sponsor at any time;
provided, however, that in the event of a Change of Control, the Trustee may
thereafter be removed only after securing the written consent of a majority
of the participants of the Plan and the designated beneficiaries of deceased
participants.

     (c)  Upon the removal or resignation of the Trustee, any successor
appointed shall have the same powers and duties as those conferred upon the
Trustee under this Trust.  Prior to a Change of Control, the appointment of
any successor Trustee shall be in the sole discretion of the Primary Sponsor. 
On or after a Change of Control, the appointment of any successor Trustee
shall be made only with the consent of a majority of the participants of the
Plans and the designated beneficiaries of deceased participants.  Upon
receipt by the Trustee of a written acceptance of the appointment by the
successor Trustee, the Trustee shall transfer to the successor Trustee the
assets constituting the Trust; provided, however, the Trustee shall not be
required to pay over assets to a successor Trustee unless the Trustee shall
be discharged from all liability for any taxes which may be due and owing by
the Trust, or unless the successor Trustee, who must be acceptable to the
Trustee, indemnifies the Trustee and the Trustee in its sole discretion
agrees to accept indemnification.  In the event that within ninety (90) days
after the removal or resignation of the Trustee the Primary Sponsor shall
have failed to appoint a successor Trustee or the Trustee shall not have
received a written acceptance from a successor Trustee, then the Trustee may
file an appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction and transfer
to the custody of the court the assets then held by the Trustee constituting
the Trust.  Upon transfer to a successor Trustee or to the court, as the case
may be, the Trustee shall be relieved of all further responsibilities and
liabilities in connection with the Trust.  The Trustee is authorized,
however, to reserve therefrom any assets as it may deem advisable for payment
of its fees and expenses in connection with the settlement of its account or
otherwise, and any balance of the reserve remaining after the payment of the
Trustee's fees and expenses shall be paid over to the successor Trustee or
to the court.

                          SECTION 12.

                   AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     (a)  Prior to a Change of Control, the Trust Agreement may be amended
any time and to any extent by a written instrument executed by the Primary
Sponsor, provided, however, that no such amendment shall be effective to the
extent that it purports to make the Trust revocable.  In addition, no such
amendment shall have the effect of reducing benefits accrued by participants
under the Plan, delaying the times at which distributions are made from the
Fund to participants and their beneficiaries or allowing a Plan Sponsor or
any other person to receive distributions of the assets of the Fund not then
permitted under the terms of the Trust Agreement.  On or after a Change of
Control, this Trust Agreement may only be amended with the consent of a
majority of the participants of the Plan and the designated beneficiaries of
deceased participants.  No amendment that purports to increase the duties or
responsibilities of the Trustee or to alter materially the manner in which
the Trustee is to discharge any continuing duties or responsibilities shall
be given effect without the consent of the Trustee and no other amendment
shall be given effect without first providing notice of same to the Trustee. 
The Trustee and Primary Sponsor or, if applicable, a majority of the
participants of the Plan and the designated beneficiaries of deceased
participants may amend the Trust Agreement in any manner not otherwise
specifically precluded by this Subsection, including any amendment regarding
the removal of an existing Trustee or the appointment of a successor Trustee.

     (b)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Trust Agreement to
the contrary, the Trust shall terminate and all Fund assets shall be
distributed (i) on the complete distribution of the Fund in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Plan; (ii) upon the delivery to the Trustee
of a writing terminating the Trust signed by the Primary Sponsor, all
participants of the Plan and the designated beneficiaries of deceased
participants; or (iii) in the event the Internal Revenue Service makes a
final determination that the assets of the Fund constitute compensation
currently taxable as income to participants.  Any assets remaining in the
Fund after satisfaction of all liabilities and expenses of the Plan shall be
returned to the Plan Sponsors.




                          SECTION 13.

                         MISCELLANEOUS

     (a)  The Trustee shall under no circumstances be required to recognize
any conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge or encumbrance by any
participant or any person entitled to receive benefits under the Plan, any
part of it, or any interest in it, or to pay any money or thing of value to
any creditor or assignee of any participant or person for any cause
whatsoever; provided, however, this Subsection (a) does not affect the
provisions of Section 8 of the Trust Agreement.

     (b)  The Primary Sponsor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Trustee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs and expenses, including but not limited to, liability for
any judgments or settlements consented to in writing by the Trustee, as
applicable, which consents will not be unreasonably withheld, and reasonable
attorneys' fees arising out of or in connection with or as a direct or
indirect result of its serving, respectively, as the trustee (including but
not limited to the Trustee's acts or omissions with respect to (i) the voting
of any share of stock held as part of the assets of the Trust;
(ii) establishing or maintaining investment funds or effecting investments
therein in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Trust; (iii) the
determinations by the Trustee of insolvency or of a Change of Control
(including acts or omissions in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Trust following any determination of insolvency or a Change of Control);
or (iv) the determination by the Trustee of Surplus Amounts or benefits
payable to participants or their beneficiaries), except those losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, if any, arising out of or in
connection with or as a direct or indirect result of the Trustee's bad faith,
gross negligence or willful neglect or breach of trust.  In amplification of
and without limiting the foregoing, the Primary Sponsor specifically agrees
to indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless from and against any and all
liability, loss, damage, cost or expense arising out of or in connection with
(A) the transfer of any portion of the Fund to a subtrustee at the direction
of the Primary Sponsor; (B) any act or omission of a subtrustee, provided the
Trustee had no knowledge of such act or omission acquired through its normal
course of dealings with the subtrustee, or if the Trustee did have such
knowledge either the Trustee timely notified the Primary Sponsor in writing
or the Primary Sponsor otherwise received timely notice of such act or
omission; or (C) any decision by the Trustee to terminate a subtrust
following a Change of Control.  Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence
shall require the Primary Sponsor to indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless
from and against any liability, loss, damage, cost or expense attributable
to regulatory action taken by any Federal or state agency having jurisdiction
over the Trustee, as a banking institution, with regard to the establishment
or maintenance of a subtrust.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Primary
Sponsor of any claim, action or proceeding for which it may seek indemnity. 
This indemnity is a continuing obligation and shall be binding on the Primary
Sponsor and its successors, whether by merger or otherwise, and assigns.  In
addition, this indemnity shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Trustee, the liquidation of the Trust, or both events.

     (c)  As used in this Trust Agreement, the term "Change of Control"
means any event that pursuant to the requirements of Article X of the Primary
Sponsor's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time,
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than eighty percent
(80%) of the Voting Stock (as defined therein); provided, however, that no
event shall constitute a Change of Control if approved by the Board of
Directors of the Primary Sponsor a majority of whom are "present directors"
and "new directors."  For purposes of the preceding sentence, "present
directors" shall mean individuals who as of the date of this Trust Agreement
were members of the Board of Directors of the Primary Sponsor and "new
directors" shall mean any director whose election by the Board of Directors
of the Primary Sponsor (in the event of vacancy) or whose nomination for
election by the Primary Sponsor's stockholders was approved by a vote of at
least three-fourths of the directors then still in office who are present
directors and new directors; provided that any director elected to the Board
of Directors of the Primary Sponsor solely to settle a threatened or actual
proxy contest shall in no event be deemed to be a new director.  The board
of directors of the Primary Sponsor shall immediately notify the Trustee of
the occurrence of a Change of Control.  Upon receipt of such written notice
or in the event the Trustee has actual knowledge that a Change of Control has
occurred, the Trustee shall take no action nor facilitate the taking of any
action contemplated by the Trust Agreement as being taken prior to a Change
of Control if (i) an alternative procedure for taking such action is
prescribed on or after a Change of Control, or (ii) any action of the type
described is expressly limited to the period prior to a Change of Control. 
If the Trustee should receive any written allegation to the effect that a
Change of Control has occurred, the Trustee shall take no action nor
facilitate the taking of any action described in the immediately preceding
sentence until making an independent determination as to whether a Change of
Control has occurred.  The Trustee shall make this determination within a
period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of the written allegation. 
Following the determination, the Trustee shall discharge its duties under the
Trust Agreement in a manner consistent with that determination.

     (d)  Prior to a Change of Control, authority and responsibility with
regard to the voting of and control over any securities of a Plan Sponsor
held in the Trust shall be exercised as follows:  (i) the Primary Sponsor
shall direct the Trustee in writing as to the manner in which such securities
are to be voted; and (ii) all other decisions affecting such securities,
including, without limitation, decisions to oppose or consent to tender or
exchange offers, shall be similarly directed by the Primary Sponsor.  The
Trustee shall take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out
the directions of the Primary Sponsor given pursuant to this Subsection.  On
or after a Change of Control, voting and all other decisions relating to the
securities of a Plan Sponsor shall be made by the Trustee or, if such
securities are subject to the investment authority of an Investment Manager
by that Investment Manager.

     (e)  The Trustee shall be required to take any and all reasonable
legal action to enforce the obligations of each Plan Sponsor under the Trust
Agreement.

     (f)  Whenever the context requires, words of the masculine gender used
herein shall include the feminine and the neuter, and the words used in the
singular shall include the plural.

   (g)  Each provision of the Trust Agreement is severable and if any
provision is found to be void as against public policy it shall not affect the
validity of any other provision hereof.

   (h)  The Trust Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns
of each Plan Sponsor and the Trustee.

   (i)  The providers of the Trust shall be construed according to the laws
of the State of Alabama and, to the extent applicable, according to the United
States.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals the
day and year first above written.

                          MANAGEMENT RETIREMENT PLAN



      THIS INDENTURE made and entered into this 28th day of    March   , 1989,
by MORRISON INCORPORATED, a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"):


                             W I T N E S S E T H:

      WHEREAS, the Company established the Morrison Incorporated Management
Retirement Plan (the "Plan"), effective June 1, 1989; and

      WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide for a select group of management
or highly compensated long-term employees the security of receiving a defined
level of retirement benefits from the Plan, when considered together with
benefits provided from the Company-funded portion of certain other employee
benefits provided by the Company;

      NOW, THEREFORE, effective as of June 1, 1989, the Company hereby agrees
to provide certain benefits in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:


                                   ARTICLE I
                                  DEFINITIONS

      1.01    "Accrued Benefit" means the benefit payable to a Participant in
accordance with Article IV hereof as a yearly amount, calculated as a single
life annuity for the life of the Participant, equal to 1.5 percent of the
Participant's Final Average Compensation multiplied by the number of Years of
Credited Service not to exceed 20, plus 2 percent of the Participant's Final
Average Compensation multiplied by each additional Year of Credited Service in
excess of 20 but not to exceed 30, minus the sum of (a) the Participant's
Frozen Retirement Plan Benefit, (b) the Participant's Social Security Benefits
and (c) the Participant's Executive Supplemental Pension Plan Benefit.

      1.02    "Actuarial Equivalent" means, with respect to a benefit, any
benefit provided under the terms of the Plan which has the same present value
on the date the benefit payment commences.  For the purpose of establishing
whether a benefit is the Actuarial Equivalent of another benefit, the Company
shall apply the same factors for determining actuarial equivalence under the
Frozen Retirement Plan.

      1.03    "Affiliate" means (a) any corporation which is a member of the
same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of Section 414(b) of
the Code) as is the Company, (b) any other trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) controlling, controlled by, or under common control (within the
meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code) with the Company, (c) any other
organization which is a member of an affiliated service group (within the
meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code) with the Company, and (d) any other
entity required to be aggregated with the Company pursuant to regulations
under Section 414(o) of the Code.

      1.04    "Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors of the
Company.

      1.05    "Break in Service" means any Plan Year during which a
Participant has not completed more than 500 Hours of Service.  A Break in
Service shall not occur during:

              (a)       an absence or leave of absence, with or without pay,
      which was authorized by the Company for a period not to exceed one year
      provided that the Participant returns to the active service of the
      Company at or prior to the termination of the absence or leave;

              (b)       periods of military service during which time the
      Participant's rights were protected by law; or

              (c)       maternity or paternity leave of absence caused:

                  (1)   by reason of pregnancy of the individual,

                  (2)   by reason of the birth of a child of the Participant,

                  (3)   by reason of the placement of a child in connection
              with the adoption of a child by the Participant, or

                  (4)   for purposes of caring for the child during the period
              immediately following the birth or placement for adoption.

      In the case of (c) above, the Participant shall be considered as having
completed either the number of hours that would have been credited to the
Participant for the absence or, if the normal working hours are unknown, he
shall be credited with eight hours per normal work day during the absence. 
However, the total number of hours so credited shall not exceed 501 and
further must be credited only (i) in the year in which that absence begins for
one of the permitted reasons listed herein if the crediting is necessary to
prevent a Break in Service in that year or (ii) in the following year.

      1.06    "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      1.07    "Compensation" means the total compensation that would be
subject to tax under Code Section 3101(a) (but without the dollar limitation
of Code Section 3121(a)(1) and excluding any amounts paid as Long-Term
Disability Benefits) paid to a Participant by the Company, or any Affiliate,
during a Plan Year, including amounts paid or credited to a Participant as
nonqualified deferred compensation by the Company or any Affiliate,
notwithstanding the provisions of Code Section 3121(v)(2), but in no event in
excess of $100,000 (as adjusted from time to time at the sole discretion of

time, that period shall not be counted for purposes of determining Years of
Credited Service; (d) in the event a Participant incurs a Break in Service of

period not in excess of three consecutive Plan Years, the Plan Administrator

      4.02    Normal Retirement Date

      A Participant who reaches Normal Retirement Age while an employee of the
Company or an Affiliate may retire as of his Normal Retirement Date and shall
be entitled to receive his Accrued Benefit.  However, a Participant who is
also a participant in the Frozen Retirement Plan can only receive his Accrued
Benefit if he has begun to receive his Frozen Retirement Plan Benefit.  The

following the Participant's Normal Retirement Date and shall be payable in
accordance with Article VII hereof.

      4.03    Deferred Retirement

      A Participant may elect to remain in the employ of the Company or an
Affiliate beyond his Normal Retirement Date and defer receipt of his benefit
under the Plan until his Deferred Retirement Date.  However, a Participant who
is also a participant in the Frozen Retirement Plan can only receive his
Accrued Benefit if he has begun to receive his Frozen Retirement Plan Benefit. 
The benefit commencing upon the Participant's actual retirement date will be
his Accrued Benefit calculated as of his Deferred Retirement Date.  The
benefit under this Section 4.03 shall commence on the first day of the month
following the Participant's Deferred Retirement Date and shall be payable in
accordance with Article VII hereof.

      4.04    Early Retirement

calculated as of his Early Retirement Date. However, a Participant who is also
a participant in the Frozen Retirement Plan can only receive his Accrued
Benefit if he has begun to receive his Frozen Retirement Plan Benefit.  Except
as provided in Subsection (b) below, the benefit under this Section 4.04 shall
commence on the first day of the month following the Participant's Early
Retirement Date in accordance with Article VII hereof.

      (b)     At his Early Retirement Date, a Participant may elect to retire
but may request of the Plan Administrator permission to defer the commencement
of the payment of his Accrued Benefit to any point in time beginning at least
12 months after his Early Retirement Date.  If a Participant so elects and he
receives the permission of the Plan Administrator, his Accrued Benefit
nevertheless shall be determined based upon his Final Average Compensation as
of his Early Retirement Date although he shall continue to accrue Years of
Credited Service as provided in Section 1.22(b) hereof.

surviving him on the date of death shall be entitled to receive a survivor
annuity providing monthly benefits for life equal to fifty (50) percent of the
annuity which would have been payable during the joint lives of the
Participant and such surviving spouse if the Participant had retired on the
date immediately before his death and received a normal form of distribution
pursuant to Section 7.02 hereof.  The benefit shall be paid to such surviving
spouse on the first day of the month following the Participant's death in
accordance with Article VII hereof.  If the amount of the payment required to
commence on a specified date pursuant to this Article V cannot be made or
ascertained by that date, payment shall commence retroactively to that date.


                                  ARTICLE VI
                           TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

      6.01    Termination of Employment

      In the event a Participant's employment with the Company and its
Affiliates terminates before his Early Retirement Date, his Accrued Benefit
shall be forfeited.

      6.02    Leave of Absence

      A leave of absence which is authorized by the Company shall not
constitute a termination of employment unless the Participant fails to return
to active employment at or prior to the expiration of the leave.  If the
Participant does not return to active employment within the time specified,
then his employment shall be deemed to have terminated as of the commencement
of the leave of absence.


                                  ARTICLE VII
                      PAYMENT OF BENEFITS UPON RETIREMENT

      7.01    All forms of retirement benefits payable under the Plan shall
be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant's Accrued Benefit payable as a
single life annuity for the life of the Participant.

      7.02    In the case of a Participant who is ineligible to receive
benefits under the Frozen Retirement Plan, the normal form of distribution
made pursuant to this Section 7.02 if the Participant is married on the date
benefits are to commence shall be a joint and fifty (50) percent survivor
annuity providing monthly benefits payable for the life of the Participant
with a survivor annuity for the life of the spouse to whom he is married at
retirement which is fifty (50) percent of the amount of the annuity payable
during the joint lives of the Participant and such surviving spouse, or if the
Participant is not married on the date benefits are to commence, a single life
annuity providing monthly benefits payable for the life of the Participant. 
No later than 90 days and no earlier than 120 days prior to his retirement
date, the Participant may request of the Plan Administrator permission to have
payments made in one of the following alternative forms:

              (a)       an annuity providing for monthly benefits payable for
      the life of the Participant;

              (b)       an annuity providing for monthly benefits payable for
      the life of the Participant with 120 or 240 monthly payments guaranteed;

              (c)       a joint and survivor annuity providing for monthly
      benefits payable for the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity
      for the life of his joint annuitant designated at retirement (either his
      surviving spouse or another designee) at the rate of fifty (50),
      seventy-five (75) or one hundred (100) percent of the amount of the
      annuity payable during the joint lives of the Participant and such joint
      annuitant.

      7.03    If a Participant is eligible to receive benefits under the
Frozen Retirement Plan, his Accrued Benefit shall be paid in the same form as
the method of payment selected by the Participant under the Frozen Retirement
Plan.

      7.04    No payments of a Participant's Accrued Benefit shall be made
while the Participant is receiving Long-Term Disability Benefits.

      Whenever any benefit which shall be payable under the Plan is to be paid
to or for the benefit of any person who is then a minor or determined to be

provisions of the Plan, (b) the Plan shall be construed as if the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein, and (c) if

2.    By adding to Section 1.01 the phrase "and Section 6.01" immediately
following the phrase "Article IV" therein.


3.    By deleting the first sentence of Section 1.11 and by substituting
therefor the following:

              "1.11     Final Average Compensation means the average of a
      Participant's Compensation for the five consecutive Years of Credited
      Service immediately preceding the Participant's retirement, death or
      other termination of employment, as the case may be."


4.    By substituting in Section 1.21 the phrase "first receives benefit
payments under the Plan" in lieu of the word "retires" each time the same
appears therein.


5.    By deleting Subsection (d) of Section 1.22 and by substituting therefor
the following:

      "(d)    in the event a Participant incurs a Break in Service of more
      than three consecutive Plan Years, all Years of Credited Service prior
      to the initial Break in Service shall be disregarded for all purposes
      under the Plan, unless such action would be inconsistent with any
      individual determination by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section
      6.01 hereof."


6.    By deleting the first sentence of Article V and by substituting therefor
the following:

              "Upon the death of any married Participant (a) who is employed
      by the Company or its Affiliates on or after age 55 or (b) who
      terminated employment with the Company and its Affiliates prior to age
      55, retained his Accrued Benefit by action of the Board of Directors in
      accordance with Section 6.01 hereof and survived until at least age 55,
      the spouse surviving of such Participant shall be entitled to receive a
      survivor annuity providing monthly benefits for life equal to fifty
      percent (50%) of the annuity which would have been payable to the
      Participant and such surviving spouse under the Plan if the Participant
      had retired on the day immediately prior to his death and received a
      normal form of distribution pursuant to Section 7.02 hereof."


7.    By deleting Section 6.01 in its entirety and by substituting therefor
the following:

      "6.01   Termination of Employment

              The Accrued Benefit of a Participant who terminates employment
      with the Company and its Affiliates prior to attaining age 55 shall be
      forfeited; provided, however, that the Board of Directors, in its sole
      discretion, may determine on a case-by-case basis that the Accrued
      Benefit (based upon Final Average Compensation and Years of Credited
      Service as of the employment termination date) of any such Participant
      shall not be forfeited in which case the affected Participant shall be
      entitled to receive his Accrued Benefit with payment commencing upon his
      attainment of age 65, unless the affected Participant elects to have
      payments commence as early the first day of the month following his
      attainment of age 55.  An affected Participant who is also a participant
      in the Frozen Retirement Plan may not, however, elect to be paid under
      this Plan sooner than the date benefits commence under the Frozen
      Retirement Plan.  The payment of benefits under this Section 6.01 may be
      in such forms and shall be subject to the same conditions and
      limitations as the payment of retirement benefits under Article VII. 
      The authority vested in the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section
      6.01 to determine, on a case-by-case basis, not to forfeit an otherwise
      forfeitable benefit shall not be delegated to any other person or entity
      notwithstanding previous delegations of authority by the Board of
      Directors pertaining to the administration of the Plan."


8.    By deleting Section 12.01 in its entirety and by substituting therefor
the following:

              "12.01  The Company may terminate or amend the Plan at any time
      by resolution or written direction duly adopted by the Board of
      Directors."

      Except as specifically provided herein, the Plan shall remain in full
force and effect as prior to this First Amendment.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this First Amendment
to be executed as the day and year first above written.

                          DEFINITIONS



     Wherever used herein, the masculine pronoun shall be deemed to
include the feminine, and the singular to include the plural, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise and the following words and phrases
shall, when used herein, have the meanings set forth below:

     1.1  "Account" means the account established and maintained by the
Plan Administrator to reflect the interest of a Member in the Fund.  In
addition to any other accounts as the Plan Administrator may establish and
maintain, the Plan Administrator shall establish and maintain separate
accounts (each of which shall be adjusted pursuant to the Plan to reflect
income, gains, losses and other credits or charges attributable thereto)
for each Member to be designated as follows:

          (a)  "Employee Deferred Account" which shall reflect a
     Member's interest in contributions made by a Plan Sponsor under Plan
     Section 3.1.

          (b)  "Company Matching Account" which shall reflect a
     Member's interest in matching contributions made by a Plan Sponsor
     under Plan Section 3.2.  The Company Matching Account shall consist
     of a Company Stock Subaccount which shall hold shares of Company
     Stock attributable to Plan Sponsor matching contributions and cash
     held pending the purchase of shares of Company Stock pursuant to
     Plan Section 3.2(c) and an Other Investment Subaccount which shall
     hold all other assets attributable to Plan Sponsor matching
     contributions.

          (c)  "Voluntary Contribution Account" which shall reflect a
     Member's interest in Voluntary Contributions made by a Member to the
     Fund pursuant to Plan Section 3.3. 

          (d)  "Rollover Account" which shall reflect a Member's
     interest in Rollover Amounts.

     1.2  "Accrued Benefit" means those shares of Company Stock and cash
held pending the purchase of shares of Company Stock credited to a
Member's Company Stock Subaccount of his Company Matching Account and the

and the balance of his other Accounts.

     1.3  "Affiliate" means (a) any corporation which is a member of the
same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of Code Section
414(b)) as is a Plan Sponsor, (b) any other trade or business (whether or
not incorporated) under common control (within the meaning of Code Section
414(c)) with a Plan Sponsor, (c) any other corporation, partnership or
other organization which is a member of an affiliated service group
(within the meaning of Code Section 414(m)) with a Plan Sponsor, and

pursuant to regulations under Code Section 414(o). 

     1.4  "Annual Compensation" means the amount paid to, or accrued by,
an Employee by or from a Plan Sponsor (and Affiliates for purposes of
Appendices A and C) during a Plan Year as compensation that would be
subject to income tax withholding under Code Section 3401(a) (but without
regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on
the nature or location of the employment or the services performed, such
as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)), to
the extent not in excess of the Annual Compensation Limit.  Notwith-
standing the above, Annual Compensation shall be determined as follows:

          (a)  (1) in determining with respect to each Plan Sponsor the
     amount of contributions made by or on behalf of an Employee under
     Plan Section 3 and allocations under Plan Section 4, and (2) for
     purposes of applying the provisions of Appendix A hereto for such
     Plan Years as the Secretary of the Treasury may allow, Annual
     Compensation shall only include amounts received for the portion of
     the Plan Year during which the Employee was a Member;

          (b)  for purposes of applying the Annual Compensation Limit,
     with respect to Plan Sections 3 and 4 and Appendix A, the rules
     contained in Subsection (c) of the Plan Section containing the
     definition of the term "Highly Compensated Employee" shall apply,
     except that in applying the rules, the term "family" shall include
     only the spouse of the Member and any lineal descendants of the
     Member who have not attained age 19 before the close of the Plan
     Year; and

          (c)  for all purposes under the Plan except Appendices B and
     C hereto (other than for purposes of determining who is a Key
     Employee), Annual Compensation shall include any amount which would
     have been paid during a Plan Year, but was contributed by a Plan
     Sponsor on behalf of an Employee pursuant to a salary reduction
     agreement which is not includable in the gross income of the
     Employee under Code Section 125, 402(e)(3), or 402(h); and

          (d)  for purposes of applying the annual addition limits set
     forth in Appendix B, the term Plan Sponsor as used in Plan Section
     1.4 shall mean Plan Sponsor as that term is defined in Section 4 of
     Appendix B.

     1.5  "Annual Compensation Limit" means (a) $200,000 for the Plan
Year beginning on January 1, 1989, which amount may be adjusted for each

based on changes in the cost of living as provided in regulations issued
by the Secretary of the Treasury, and (b) $150,000 for the Plan Year
beginning on January 1, 1994, which amount may be adjusted for each
subsequent Plan Year based on changes in the cost of living as provided in
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.

     1.6  "Beneficiary" means the person or trust that a Member
designated most recently in writing to the Plan Administrator; provided,
however, that if the Member has failed to make a designation, no person
designated is alive, no trust has been established, or no successor
Beneficiary has been designated who is alive, the term "Beneficiary" means
(a) the Member's spouse or (b) if no spouse is alive, the Member's
surviving children, or (c) if no children are alive, the Member's parent
or parents, or (d) if no parent is alive, the legal representative of the
deceased Member's estate.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
spouse of a married Member shall be his Beneficiary unless that spouse has
consented in writing to the designation by the Member of some other person
or trust and the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of the
designation and is witnessed by a notary public or a Plan representative. 
A Member may change his designation at any time.  However, a Member may
not change his designation without further consent of his spouse under the
terms of the preceding sentence unless the spouse's consent permits
designation of another person or trust without further spousal consent and
acknowledges that the spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific
beneficiary and that the spouse voluntarily relinquishes this right. 
Notwithstanding the above, the spouse's consent shall not be required if
the Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that
the spouse cannot be located, if the Member has a court order indicating
that he is legally separated or has been abandoned (within the meaning of
local law) unless a "qualified domestic relations order" (as defined in
Code Section 414(p)) provides otherwise, or if there are other
circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes.  If the spouse
is legally incompetent to give consent, consent by the spouse's legal
guardian shall be deemed to be consent by the spouse.  

     1.7  "Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors of the
Primary Sponsor.

Plan Sponsor.  The determination of whether or not a Disability exists
shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and shall be substantiated
by competent medical evidence. 

     1.14 "Distributee" means an Employee or former Employee.  In
addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving spouse and the
Employee's or former Employee's spouse or former spouse who is the

spouse or former spouse.

     1.15 "Effective Date" means January 1, 1989.

     1.16 "Elective Deferrals" means, with respect to any taxable year

     any other qualified cash or deferred arrangement as defined in Code
     Section 401(k), whether or not maintained by a Plan Sponsor, to the
     extent such contributions are not or would not, but for Code
     Section 402(g)(1) be included in the Member's gross income for the
     taxable year; and

          (c)  any other contributions made by or on behalf of a Member
     pursuant to Code Section 402(g)(3).

     1.17 "Eligible Employee" means any Employee of a Plan Sponsor other
than an Employee who is (a) an Employee covered by a collective bargaining
agreement between a union and a Plan Sponsor, provided that retirement
benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining, unless the collective

employee within the meaning of Code Section 414(n)(2), or deemed to be an
Employee of a Plan Sponsor pursuant to regulations under Code Section
414(o); or, effective May 1, 1989, (c) an Employee who is a Highly

twelve-consecutive-month period, any twelve-consecutive-month period

                    non-integer being increased to the next integer.

               If for any year no officer of the Plan Sponsor meets the
               requirements of this Subparagraph (D), the highest paid
               officer of the Plan Sponsor for the Plan Year shall be
               considered an officer for purposes of this
               Subparagraph (D).

               (2)  The Employee during the Plan Year in question (A)
          is described in Subsection (a)(1)(A), or (B) is both (i)

               The Plan Administrator may make an election to
          substitute $64,245 (as adjusted) for $96,368 (as adjusted) in
          Subparagraph (B) of Subsection (a)(1) provided that at all

          prescribes.

               For purposes of Subparagraphs (C) and (D) of
          Subsection (a)(1), the following shall be excluded when
          determining the number of Employees in the most highly

               between employee representatives and the Plan Sponsor or
               its Affiliates, provided 90% or more of the Employees
               are covered under collective bargaining agreements and
               the Plan only covers Employees who are not covered under
               the collective bargaining agreements.

          (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a), the
     Primary Sponsor may elect to determine each Highly Compensated
     Employee to be each Employee who during the Plan Year in question is
     described in Subsection (a) (determined without regard to the head
     language of Subsection (a)(1)), pursuant to the provisions of Treas.
     Reg. Section 1.414(q)-1T, Q&A-14(b).

          (c)  For purposes of this Section, if any Employee is a
     member of the family of a five percent (5%) owner as defined in

     Employee whose Annual Compensation is such that he is among the ten
     (10) Highly Compensated Employees receiving the greatest amount of
     Annual Compensation during the Plan Year, then (1) the Employee
     shall not be considered a separate Employee, and (2) any Annual
     Compensation paid to the Employee, and any applicable contribution
     or benefit on behalf of the Employee, shall be treated as if it were
     paid to, or on behalf of, the five percent (5%) owner or the

     receiving the greatest amount of Annual Compensation during the Plan
     Year.  For purposes of this Subsection (c), the term "family" means

     was a Highly Compensated Employee at the time the former Employee
     separated from service with the Plan Sponsor or Affiliate or (2) the
     former Employee was a Highly Compensated Employee at any time after
     the former Employee attained age 55.

          (e)  For purposes of this Section, Employees who are
     nonresident aliens and who receive no earned income from the Plan
     Sponsor or an Affiliate from sources within the United States shall
     not be treated as Employees.

          (f)  For purposes of this Section, Annual Compensation shall
     include amounts paid by Affiliates and shall be determined without
     regard to the Annual Compensation Limit.

     1.26 "Hour of Service" means:

          (a)  Each hour for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to
     payment, for the performance of duties for a Plan Sponsor or any
     Affiliate during the applicable computation period, and such hours
     shall be credited to the computation period in which the duties are
     performed.

          (b)  Each hour for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to
     payment, by a Plan Sponsor or any Affiliate on account of a period
     of time during which no duties are performed (irrespective of
     whether the employment relationship has terminated) due to vacation,
     holiday, illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury
     duty, military duty or leave of absence.

          (c)  Each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation
     of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by a Plan Sponsor or any
     Affiliate, and such hours shall be credited to the computation
     period or periods to which the award or agreement for back pay
     pertains rather than to the computation period in which the award,
     agreement or payment is made; provided, that the crediting of Hours
     of Service for back pay awarded or agreed to with respect to periods
     described in Subsection (b) of this Section shall be subject to the
     limitations set forth in Subsection (e).

          (d)  Solely for purposes of determining whether a Break in
     Service has occurred, each hour during any period that the Employee
     is absent from work (1) by reason of the pregnancy of the Employee,
     (2) by reason of the birth of a child of the Employee, (3) by reason
     of the placement of a child with the Employee in connection with the
     adoption of the child by the Employee, or (4) for purposes of caring
     for such child for a period immediately following its birth or
     placement.  The hours described in this Subsection (d) shall be
     credited (A) only in the computation period in which the absence
     from work begins, if the Employee would be prevented from incurring
     a Break in Service in that year solely because of that credit, or
     (B), in any other case, in the next following computation period.

          (e)  The Plan Administrator shall credit Hours of Service in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 2530.200b-2(b) and (c) of
     the U.S. Department of Labor Regulations or such other federal
     regulations as may from time to time be applicable and determine
     Hours of Service from the employment records of a Plan Sponsor or in
     any other manner consistent with regulations promulgated by the
     Secretary of Labor, and shall construe any ambiguities in favor of
     crediting Employees with Hours of Service.  Notwithstanding any
     other provision of this Section, in no event shall an Employee be
     credited with more than 501 Hours of Service during any single
     continuous period during which he performs no duties for the Plan
     Sponsor or Affiliate.

          (f)  In the event that an individual becomes an Eligible
     Employee of a Plan Sponsor by reason of (a) an acquisition by the
     Plan Sponsor of substantially all of the assets of another
     corporation or entity or a controlling interest of the stock of
     another corporation; (b) a merger of the individual's prior employer
     with the Plan Sponsor; or (c) the award of a food services or
     similar contract to the Plan Sponsor resulting in the hiring of a
     group of employees employed immediately prior to the award of the
     contract at the same location by an unrelated employer, then each
     such Eligible Employee may be credited Hours of Service based on the
     services he or she performed with the prior employer in the manner
     and subject to such conditions, if any, provided in resolutions
     adopted by the Plan Sponsor; provided further that the crediting of
     such Hours of Service shall not be permitted in a manner that
     discriminates significantly in favor of Highly Compensated
     Employees.

                           SECTION 3
                         CONTRIBUTIONS

     3.1  (a)  The Plan Sponsor shall make a contribution to the Fund
     on behalf of each Member who is an Eligible Employee and who has
     elected to defer a portion of Annual Compensation otherwise payable
     to him for the Plan Year and to have such portion contributed to the
     Fund.  The election must be made before the Annual Compensation is
     payable and may only be made pursuant to an agreement between the
     Member and the Plan Sponsor which shall be in such form and subject
     to such rules and limitations as the Plan Administrator may
     prescribe and shall specify the percentage of Annual Compensation
     that the Member desires to defer and to have contributed to the
     Fund.  Once a Member has made an election for a Plan Year, the
     Member may revoke or modify his election to reduce the rate of
     future deferrals, effective as of the beginning of the payroll
     period coinciding with or next following the Plan Administrator's
     processing of the revocation or modification pursuant to normal
     administrative procedures.  Once an election has been revoked or
     modified, any subsequent election by the Member shall be effective
     as of the first day of the first payroll period coinciding with or
     next following the Plan Administrator's processing of the election
     pursuant to normal administrative procedures, except that at the
     request of a Member in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator,
     the election may be given effect at a later date.

          The contribution made by a Plan Sponsor on behalf of a Member
     under this Plan Section 3.1(a) shall be in an amount equal to the
     amount specified in the Member's deferral agreement, which amount
     shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor greater than ten percent
     (10%) of the Member's Annual Compensation.  The Plan Administrator
     may adjust said percentage applicable to a Member who becomes a
     Highly Compensated Employees during a Plan Year on a prospective
     basis, but in no event shall the percentage be greater than ten
     percent (10%) of a Member's Annual Compensation.


          (b)  Elective Deferrals shall in no event exceed $8,994 (for
     1993) in any one taxable year of the Member, which amount shall be
     adjusted for changes in the cost of living as provided by the
     Secretary of the Treasury.  In the event the amount of Elective
     Deferrals exceeds $8,994 (for 1993) as adjusted, in any one taxable
     year then, (1) not later than the immediately following March 1, the
     Member may designate to the Plan the portion of the Member's
     Deferral Amount which consists of excess Elective Deferrals, and (2)
     not later than the immediately following April 15, the Plan may
     distribute the amount designated to it under Paragraph (1) above, as
     adjusted to reflect income, gain, or loss attributable to it through
     the date of the distribution, and reduced by any "Excess Deferral
     Amounts," as defined in Appendix A hereto, previously distributed or
     recharacterized with respect to the Member for the Plan Year
     beginning with or within that taxable year.  The payment of the
     excess Elective Deferrals, as adjusted and reduced, from the Plan
     shall be made to the Member without regard to any other provision in
     the Plan.  In the event that a Member's Elective Deferrals exceed
     $8,994, as adjusted, in any one taxable year under the Plan and
     other plans of the Plan Sponsor and its Affiliates, the Member shall
     be deemed to have designated for distribution under the Plan the
     amount of excess Elective Deferrals, as adjusted and reduced, by
     taking into account only Elective Deferral amounts under the Plan
     and other plans of the Plan Sponsor and its Affiliates.

     3.2  (a)  Each Plan Sponsor proposes to make matching
     contributions to the Fund with respect to each Plan Year on behalf
     of each Member entitled to an allocation under Plan Section 4.1 in
     an amount equal to (i) twenty percent (20%) of the Member's Annual
     Compensation deferred by the Member pursuant to Plan Section 3.1 in
     the case of a Member who has completed at least three (3) Years of
     Service but fewer than ten (10) Years of Service; (ii) thirty
     percent (30%) of the Member's Annual Compensation deferred by the
     Member pursuant to Plan Section 3.1 in the case of a Member who has
     completed at least ten (10) Years of Service but fewer than twenty
     (20) Years of Service; and (iii) forty percent (40%) of the Member's
     Annual Compensation deferred by the Member pursuant to Plan Section
     3.1 in the case of a Member who has completed at least twenty (20)
     Years of Service.  The Plan Sponsor's contribution shall be reduced
     to the extent necessary, if any, to comply with the limitations in
     Appendices A and B hereof.

          (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan Section
     3.2 to the contrary, in the case of a Member who becomes a Highly
     Compensated Employee during a Plan Year, the Plan Sponsor proposes
     to make a matching contribution, in lieu of any contribution on
     behalf of the Highly Compensated Employee under Plan Section 3.2(a),
     on behalf of such Highly Compensated Employee in an amount equal to
     twenty percent (20%) of the Highly Compensated Employee's Annual
     Compensation contributed to the Member's Employee Deferred Account
     pursuant to Plan Section 3.1, regardless of the Member's Years of
     Service.

          (c)  Plan Sponsor contributions made pursuant to this Plan
     Section may be made in cash or in kind, including, without
     limitation, shares of Company Stock, at the discretion of the Plan
     Sponsor.  Unless the Primary Sponsor directs otherwise, the Trustee
     shall use Plan Sponsor matching contributions made in the form of
     cash to acquire shares of Company Stock that are issued and
     outstanding.  The Primary Sponsor may request the Trustee to acquire
     the necessary shares by purchasing (i) newly issued shares of
     Company Stock, or (ii) shares of Company Stock held as treasury
     shares.

          (d)  Effective July 1, 1992, for purposes of determining the
     amount of matching contributions to be credited to a Member's
     Company Matching Account, all or a portion of a Member's years of
     employment with a predecessor employer may be counted if the Member
     became an Eligible Employee of a Plan Sponsor by reason of (1) an
     acquisition by the Plan Sponsor of substantially all of the assets
     of another corporation or entity or of a controlling interest of the
     stock of another corporation; (2) a merger of the Member's prior
     employer with the Plan Sponsor; or (3) the award of a food services
     or similar contract to the Plan Sponsor resulting in the hiring of a
     group of employees employed immediately prior to the award of the
     contract at the same location by an unrelated employer and if, at
     the time of the acquisition, merger or award or as soon as
     practicable thereafter, the Plan Sponsor adopts resolutions
     providing for the counting of such years of employment in favor of a
     group or category of similarly situated individuals that included
     the Member.  The counting of any such years of employment shall be
     specified in those resolutions and shall be subject to such
     conditions, if any, provided therein; provided further that the
     counting of any such years of employment shall not be made in a
     manner that discriminates in favor of Highly Compensated Employees.

     3.3  Subject to such rules and limitations as the Plan
Administrator may from time to time prescribe, each Member who contributed
at least two percent (2%) of his Annual Compensation under Plan Section
3.1 may contribute to the Fund as a Voluntary Contribution an amount of
his Annual Compensation not in excess of ten percent (10%) thereof;
provided, however, that this limitation shall apply in the aggregate to
all Voluntary Contributions made by a Member to two (2) or more plans
maintained by the Plan Sponsor.  Voluntary Contributions shall be made to
the Fund through regular payroll deductions or in such other manner as
shall be agreed upon by each Member and the Plan Administrator.  The Plan
Administrator may, at any time, suspend the making of any further
Voluntary Contributions.  Any Member who becomes a Highly Compensated
Employee during a Plan Year shall be ineligible to make further Voluntary
Contributions.

     3.4  Any Member may, with the consent of the Plan Administrator and
subject to such rules and conditions as the Plan Administrator may
prescribe, transfer a Rollover Amount to the Fund; provided, however, that
the Plan Administrator shall not administer this provision in a manner
which is discriminatory in favor of Highly Compensated Employees.

     3.5  Contributions may be made only in cash or other property which
is acceptable to the Trustee.  In no event will the sum of contributions
under Plan Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 exceed the deductible limits under
Code Section 404.


                           SECTION 4
                          ALLOCATIONS

     4.1  As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
withholding by the Plan Sponsor, if applicable, and receipt by the
Trustee, Plan Sponsor contributions made on behalf of each Member under
Plan Sections 3.1 and 3.2, Voluntary Contributions and Rollover Amounts
contributed by the Member shall be allocated to the Employee Deferred
Account, Voluntary Contribution Account and Rollover Account,
respectively, of the Member on behalf of whom the contributions were made.

     4.2  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan and the Trust, as of
each Valuation Date, the Trustee shall determine the net income or net
loss of the Fund as hereinafter set forth.

          (a)  The net income or net loss of the Company Stock
     Subaccounts shall be determined separately by the Trustee and
     allocated to each Member's Account as follows:

               (1)  Any cash dividends with respect to Company Stock
          allocated to the Company Stock Subaccount of a Member as of
          the record date on which such cash dividend was declared shall
          be immediately allocated to the Other Investment Subaccount of
          the Member's Account.

               (2)  Any additional shares of Company Stock which are
          issued with respect to any Company Stock held in a Company
          Stock Subaccount for any reason, including, but not limited
          to, stock dividends, mergers or stock splits, shall be
          immediately allocated to the Company Stock Subaccount as of
          the date on which the additional shares of Company Stock are
          delivered to the Trustee. The additional shares of Company
          Stock shall be credited to each Company Stock Subaccount based
          upon the number of shares of Company Stock in each Company
          Stock Subaccount as of the record date on which the stock
          dividend or other issuance was declared or received, as the
          case may be.

          (b)  The net income or net loss of the Other Investment
     Subaccounts shall be determined separately by the Trustee and
     allocated to each Member's Account as follows:

               (1)  To the cash income, if any, since the last
          Valuation Date, there shall be added or subtracted, as the
          case may be, any net increase or decrease, since the last
          Valuation Date, in the fair market value of the assets of each
          Individual Fund, any gain or loss on the sale or exchange of
          assets of the Individual Fund since the last Valuation Date,
          accrued interest since the last Valuation Date with respect to
          any interest bearing security as to which the purchaser would
          be required to pay such accrued interest in addition to the
          quoted price, the amount of any dividend which shall have been
          declared since the last Valuation Date but not paid on shares
          of stock owned by the Individual Fund if the market quotation
          used in determining the value of such shares is ex-dividend,
          and the amount of any other assets of the Individual Fund
          determined by the Trustee to be income since the last
          Valuation Date.

               (2)  From the sum thereof there shall be deducted all
          charges, expenses, and liabilities accrued since the last
          Valuation Date which are proper under the provisions of the
          Plan and Trust and which in the discretion of the and which in
          the discretion of the Trustee are properly chargeable against
          income of the Individual Fund for the period. 

          The net income or net loss so determined shall be allocated as
     of the Valuation Date to the Other Investment Subaccounts of each
     Member in the proportion that the balance of the Member's Other
     Investment Subaccount invested in the Individual Fund as of the
     preceding Valuation Date bears to the total value of all Members'
     Other Investment Subaccounts invested in the Individual Fund as of
     the preceding Valuation Date.


                           SECTION 5
                 WITHDRAWALS DURING EMPLOYMENT

     5.1  Effective January 1, 1994, subject to the rules and conditions
as the Plan Administrator may prescribe, by request, a Member may receive
a distribution as soon as administratively practicable of all or a portion
of the balance of his Rollover Account and Voluntary Contribution Account;
provided any such Rollover Amounts have been held in the Plan for a
minimum of two (2) years.  Any request for a distribution under this
Section must be made on the forms and in the manner prescribed by the Plan
Administrator.

     5.2  The Trustee shall, upon the direction of the Plan
Administrator, distribute all or a portion of a Member's Employee Deferred
Account consisting of Deferral Amounts (but not earnings thereon) prior to
the time such account is otherwise distributable in accordance with the
other provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that any such
distribution shall be made only if the Member is an Employee and
demonstrates that he is suffering from "hardship" as determined herein. 
For purposes of this Plan Section, a distribution will be deemed to be an
account of hardship if the distribution is on account of:

          (a)  expenses for medical care described in Code
     Section 213(d) incurred by the Member, his spouse, or any
     dependents of the Member (as defined in Code Section 152) or
     necessary for these persons to obtain medical care described
     in Code Section 213(d);

          (b)  purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a
     principal residence for the Member;

          (c)  payment of tuition and related educational fees
     for the next twelve (12) months of post-secondary education
     for the Member, his spouse, children, or dependents;

          (d)  the need to prevent the eviction of the Member
     from his principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage of
     the Member's principal residence; or

          (e)  any other contingency determined by the Internal
     Revenue Service to constitute an "immediate and heavy
     financial need" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
     Section 1.401(k)-1(d).

     5.3  In addition to the requirements set forth in Plan Section 5.2,
any distribution pursuant to Plan Section 5.2 shall not be in excess of
the amount necessary to satisfy the need determined under Plan Section 5.2
and shall also be subject to the requirements of Subsection (a) or (b) of
this Plan Section.

          (a)  (1)  The Member shall first obtain all distributions,
          other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable loans
          currently available under all plans maintained by the Plan
          Sponsor;

               (2)  the Plan Sponsor shall not permit Elective
          Deferrals or after-tax employee contributions to be made to
          the Plan or any other plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor, for
          a period of twelve (12) months after the Member receives the
          distribution pursuant to this Plan Section; and

               (3)  the Plan Sponsor shall not permit Elective
          Deferrals to be made to the Plan or any other plan maintained
          by the Plan Sponsor for the Member's taxable year immediately
          following the taxable year of the hardship distribution in
          excess of the limit under Plan Section 3.1(b) for the taxable
          year, less the amount of the Elective Deferrals made to the
          Plan or any other plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor for the
          taxable year in which the distribution under this Plan Section
          occurs.

          (b)  (1)  The Member shall first obtain all other
          distributions, other than hardship distributions, and all
          nontaxable loans available under all plans maintained by the
          Plan Sponsor; and

               (2)  the Plan Administrator shall determine that it can
          reasonably rely on the Member's certification by execution of
          a form provided by the Plan Administrator that the need
          determined under Plan Section 5.2 cannot be relieved --

                    (A)  through reimbursement or compensation by
               insurance or otherwise,

                    (B)  by reasonable liquidation of the assets of
               the Member, his spouse and minor children, to the extent
               that the liquidation would not itself cause an immediate
               and heavy financial need and to the extent that the
               assets of the spouse and minor children are reasonably
               available to the Member,

                    (C)  by cessation of Elective Deferrals, or

                    (D)  by other distributions or nontaxable (at the
               time of the distribution) loans from plans maintained by
               the Plan Sponsor or any other employer, or by borrowing
               from commercial sources on reasonable commercial terms.

Such distribution shall be made only in accordance with such rules,
policies, procedures, restrictions, and conditions as the Plan
Administrator may from time to time adopt.  Any determination of the
existence of hardship and the amount to be distributed on account thereof
shall be made by the Plan Administrator (or such other person as may be
required to make such decisions) in accordance with the foregoing rules as
applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner; provided that, unless
the Member requests otherwise, any such distribution shall include the
amount necessary to pay any federal, state and local income taxes and
penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution.

     5.4  Any distribution under this Plan Section shall be made in a
lump sum to the Member, and shall be subject to the Eligible Rollover
Distribution requirements set forth in Plan Section 7.3.


                           SECTION 6
                        DEATH BENEFITS

     6.1  Upon the death of a Member who is an Employee at the time of
his death, his Beneficiary shall be entitled to the full value of his
Accrued Benefit.  

     6.2  Upon the death of a Member who is not an Employee at the time
of his death, prior to the distribution of his vested Accrued Benefit, his
Beneficiary shall be entitled to his vested Accrued Benefit.

     6.3  If, subsequent to the death of a Member, the Member's
Beneficiary dies while entitled to receive benefits under the Plan, the
successor Beneficiary, if any, or the Beneficiary listed under Subsection
(a), (b) or (c) of the Plan Section containing the definition of the term
"Beneficiary" shall generally be entitled to receive benefits under the
Plan.  However, if the deceased Beneficiary was the Member's spouse at the
time of the Member's death, or if no successor Beneficiary shall have been
designated by the Member and be alive and no Beneficiary listed under
Subsection (a), (b) or (c) of the Plan Section containing the definition
of the term "Beneficiary" shall be alive, the Member's unpaid vested
Accrued Benefit shall be paid to the personal representative of the
deceased Beneficiary's estate. 

     6.4  Any benefit payable under this Section 6 shall be paid in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of Plan Section 7 or Plan
Section 8, whichever is applicable, after receipt by the Trustee from the
Plan Administrator of notice of the death of the Member.


                           SECTION 7
          PAYMENT OF BENEFITS ON RETIREMENT OR DEATH

     7.1  The Accrued Benefit of a Member who has attained a Retirement
Date or has attained Normal Retirement Age or died while an Employee shall
be fully vested and nonforfeitable.  As of a Member's Retirement Date or
death while an Employee, he or his Beneficiary shall be entitled to his
Accrued Benefit to be paid in accordance with this Plan Section 7.  The
Accrued Benefit of a Member which is to be paid under this Section 7 shall
be determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately
preceding the date the Accrued Benefit is valued for imminent payout
purposes pursuant to normal administrative procedures, and shall be
increased by any amounts allocated to the Member's Account after that
Valuation Date and reduced by any distributions made from the Member's
account after that Valuation Date.  Payments to a Member, or to the
Beneficiary of a deceased Member, shall commence as soon as
administratively feasible after the Member's Retirement Date or death.  If
the amount of the payment required to commence on a date cannot be
ascertained by that date, payment shall commence retroactively to that
date and shall commence no later than sixty (60) days after the earliest
date on which the amount of payment can be ascertained. 

     7.2  The payment of a Member's Accrued Benefit shall be in the form
of one lump sum in cash.  If the Member's interest in the Morrison Stock
Fund (as defined in the Trust) equals or exceeds the value of one hundred
(100) shares of Company Stock, that interest may be distributed in the
form of whole shares of Company Stock if the Member so elects by written
instrument delivered to the Plan Administrator.

     7.3  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election under this Plan
Section 7, effective January 1, 1993, a Distributee may elect, at the time
and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any
portion of a distribution pursuant to this Plan Section which is an
Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement
Plan specified by the Distributee in a direct rollover so long as all
Eligible Rollover Distributions to a Distributee for a calendar year total
or are expected to total at least $200 and, in the case of a Distributee
who elects to directly receive a portion of an Eligible Rollover
Distribution and directly roll the balance over to an Eligible Rollover
Plan, the portion that is to be directly rolled over totals at least $500.

     7.4  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary,
effective January 1, 1994, if a Member's vested Accrued Benefit exceeds
$3,500, it shall not be distributed before the Member's "required
beginning date," as defined in Plan Section 7.5(c), or death without the
consent of the Member.

     7.5  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan,

          (a)  Prior to the death of a Member, all retirement payments
     hereunder shall --

               (1)  be distributed to the Member not later than the
          required beginning date (as defined below) or,

               (2)  be distributed, commencing not later than the
          required beginning date (as defined below)--

                    (A)  in accordance with regulations prescribed by
               the Secretary of the Treasury, over the life of the
               Member or over the lives of the Member and his
               designated individual Beneficiary, if any, or

                    (B)  in accordance with regulations prescribed by
               the Secretary of the Treasury, over a period not
               extending beyond the life expectancy of the Member or
               the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the
               Member and his designated individual Beneficiary, if
               any. 

          (b)  (1)  If --

                    (A)  the distribution of a Member's retirement
               payments have begun in accordance with Subsection (a)(2)
               of this Plan Section, and

                    (B)  the Member dies before his entire vested
               Accrued Benefit has been distributed to him,

          then the remaining portion of his vested Accrued Benefit shall
          be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of
          distribution being used under Subsection (a)(2) of this Plan
          Section as of the date of his death. 

               (2)  If a Member dies before the commencement of
          retirement payments hereunder, the entire interest of the
          Member shall be distributed within five (5) years after his
          death. 

               (3)  If --

                    (A)  any portion of a Member's vested Accrued
               Benefit is payable to or for the benefit of the Member's
               designated individual Beneficiary, if any,

                    (B)  that portion is to be distributed, in
               accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
               of the Treasury, over the life of the designated
               individual Beneficiary or over a period not extending
               beyond the life expectancy of the designated individual
               Beneficiary, and

                    (C)  the distributions begin not later than one
               (1) year after the date of the Member's death or such
               later date as the Secretary of the Treasury may by
               regulations prescribe,

          then, for purposes of Paragraph (2) of this Subsection (b),
          the portion referred to in Subparagraph (A) of this Paragraph
          (3) shall be treated as distributed on the date on which the
          distributions to the designated individual Beneficiary begin. 

               (4)  If the designated individual Beneficiary referred
          to in Paragraph (3)(A) of this Subsection (b) is the surviving
          spouse of the Member, then --

                    (A)  the date on which the distributions are
               required to begin under Paragraph (3)(C) of this
               Subsection (b) shall not be earlier than the date on
               which the Member would have attained age 70-1/2, and

                    (B)  if the surviving spouse dies before the
               distributions to such spouse begin, this Subsection (b)
               shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the
               Member. 

          (c)  For purposes of this Plan Section, the term "required
     beginning date" means April 1 of the calendar year following the
     calendar year in which the Member attains age 70-1/2. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Member who is not
     described in Section 1(b)(3) of Appendix C hereto and who has
     attained age 70-1/2 before January 1, 1988, the term "required
     beginning date" means April 1 of the calendar year following the
     calendar year in which the Member retires or otherwise terminates
     employment.

          (d)  Distributions will be made in accordance with the
     regulations under Code Section 401(a)(9), including the minimum
     distribution incidental benefit requirement of Treas. Reg. Section
     1.401(a)(9)-2.


                           SECTION 8
       PAYMENT OF BENEFITS ON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     8.1  Transfer of a Member from one Plan Sponsor to another Plan
Sponsor or to an Affiliate shall not be deemed for any purpose under the
Plan to be a termination of employment of the Member.

     8.2  In the event of the termination of employment of a Member for
reasons other than death or attainment of a Retirement Date, the Member's
Accrued Benefit shall be determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding
with or immediately preceding the date the Member's Accrued Benefit is
valued for imminent payout purposes pursuant to normal administrative
procedures, increased by any contributions or Rollover Amounts allocated
to the Account of the Member after that Valuation Date and reduced by any
distributions therefrom.

     8.3  That portion of a Member's Accrued Benefit in which he is
vested shall be the balance of his Account as of the Valuation Date
coinciding with or immediately preceding the date his Accrued Benefit is
paid.

     8.4  The Member shall be entitled to payment in the form of payment
set forth in Plan Section 7.2.  Payment shall be made as soon as
administratively feasible after the Member terminates employment;
provided, however, effective January 1, 1994, if the Member's vested
Accrued Benefit exceeds $3,500 it will not be distributed before the
Member's "required beginning date," within the meaning of Plan
Section 7.5(c), or death without the Member's consent.  In no event shall
payment be made later than sixty (60) days after the end of the Plan Year
in which the Normal Retirement Age of the Member occurs.  Payment shall be
subject to the minimum distribution requirements set forth in Plan Section
7.5, and the Eligible Rollover Distribution requirements set forth in Plan
Section 7.3.

     8.5  If a Member who has terminated employment with a Plan Sponsor
is reemployed by a Plan Sponsor or an Affiliate on or prior to the payment
to the payment to the Member of the full amount of his Accrued Benefit,
the Member's Account shall be treated as the Account of a Member who has
not terminated employment other than in regard to allocations of Plan
Sponsor contributions which would have been made to his Account at any
Valuation Date occurring while the Member was not employed by a Plan
Sponsor.

     8.6  In the event that a Plan amendment directly or indirectly
changes the vesting schedule, the vesting percentage for each Member in
his Accrued Benefit accumulated to the date when the amendment is adopted
shall not be reduced as a result of the amendment.  In addition, any
Member with at least three (3) Years of Service may irrevocably elect to
remain under the pre-amendment vesting schedule with respect to all of his
benefits accrued both before and after the amendment.


                           SECTION 9
                  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

     9.1   Trust Agreement.  The Primary Sponsor shall establish a Trust
with the Trustee designated by the Board of Directors for the management
of the Fund, which Trust shall form a part of the Plan and is incorporated
herein by reference.

     9.2   Operation of the Plan Administrator.  The Primary Sponsor
shall appoint a Plan Administrator.  If an organization is appointed to
serve as the Plan Administrator, then the Plan Administrator may designate
in writing a person who may act on behalf of the Plan Administrator.  The
Primary Sponsor shall have the right to remove the Plan Administrator at
any time by notice in writing.  The Plan Administrator may resign at any
time by written notice of resignation to the Trustee and the Primary
Sponsor.  Upon removal or resignation, or in the event of the dissolution
of the Plan Administrator, the Primary Sponsor shall appoint a successor.

     9.3   Fiduciary Responsibility.

          (a)  The Plan Administrator, as a Named Fiduciary, may
     allocate its fiduciary responsibilities among Fiduciaries other than
     the Trustee, designated in writing by the Plan Administrator and may
     designate in writing persons other than the Trustee to carry out its
     fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan.  The Plan Administrator
     may remove any person designated to carry out its fiduciary
     responsibilities under the Plan at any time by notice in writing to
     such person.

          (b)  The Plan Administrator and each other Fiduciary may
     employ persons to perform services and to render advice with regard
     to any of the Fiduciary's responsibilities under the Plan.  Charges
     for all such services performed and advice rendered may be directly
     paid by each Plan Sponsor but until paid shall constitute a charge
     against the Fund.

          (c)  Each Plan Sponsor shall indemnify and hold harmless each
     person constituting the Plan Administrator or the Investment
     Committee, if any, from and against any and all claims, losses,
     costs, expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and
     court costs), damages, actions or causes of action arising from, on
     account of or in connection with the performance by such person of
     his duties in such capacity, other than such of the foregoing
     arising from, on account of or in connection with the willful
     neglect or willful misconduct of such person.

     9.4   Duties of the Plan Administrator.

          (a)  The Plan Administrator shall advise the Trustee with
     respect to all payments under the terms of the Plan and shall direct
     the Trustee in writing to make such payments from the Fund;
     provided, however, in no event shall the Trustee be required to make
     such payments if the Trustee has actual knowledge that such payments
     are contrary to the terms of the Plan and the Trust.

          (b)  The Plan Administrator shall from time to time establish
     rules, not contrary to the provisions of the Plan and the Trust, for
     the administration of the Plan and the transaction of its business. 
     All elections and designations under the Plan by a Participant or
     Beneficiary shall be made on forms prescribed by the Plan
     Administrator.  The Plan Administrator shall have discretionary
     authority to construe the terms of the Plan and shall determine all
     questions arising in the administration, interpretation and
     application of the Plan, including, but not limited to, those
     concerning eligibility for benefits and it shall not act so as to
     discriminate in favor of any person.  All determinations of the Plan
     Administrator shall be conclusive and binding on all Employees,
     Members, Beneficiaries and Fiduciaries, subject to the provisions of
     the Plan and the Trust and subject to applicable law.

          (c)  The Plan Administrator shall furnish Members and
     Beneficiaries with all disclosures now or hereafter required by
     ERISA or the Code.  The Plan Administrator shall file, as required,
     the various reports and disclosures concerning the Plan and its
     operations as required by ERISA and by the Code, and shall be solely
     responsible for establishing and maintaining all records of the Plan
     and the Trust.

          (d)  The statement of specific duties for a Plan
     Administrator in this Plan Section is not in derogation of any other
     duties which a Plan Administrator has under the provisions of the
     Plan or the Trust or under applicable law.

     9.5   Investment Manager.  The Primary Sponsor may, by action in
writing certified by notice to the Trustee, appoint an Investment
Manager.  Any Investment Manager may be removed in the same manner in
which appointed, and in the event of any removal, the Investment Manager
shall, as soon as possible, but in no event more than thirty (30) days
after notice of removal, turn over all assets managed by it to the Trustee
or to any successor Investment Manager appointed, and shall make a full
accounting to the Primary Sponsor with respect to all assets managed by it
since its appointment as an Investment Manager.  

     9.6   Investment Committee.  The Primary Sponsor may, by action in
writing certified by notice to the Trustee, appoint an Investment
Committee.  The Primary Sponsor shall have the right to remove any person
on the Investment Committee at any time by notice in writing to such
person.  A person on the Investment Committee may resign at any time by
written notice of resignation to the Primary Sponsor.  Upon such removal
or resignation, or in the event of the death of a person on the Investment
Committee, the Primary Sponsor may appoint a successor.  Until a successor
has been appointed, the remaining persons on the Investment Committee may
continue to act as the Investment Committee. 

     9.7   Action by a Plan Sponsor.  Any action to be taken by a Plan
Sponsor shall be taken by resolution or written direction duly adopted by
its board of directors or appropriate governing body, as the case may be;
provided, however, that by such resolution or written direction, the board
of directors or appropriate governing body, as the case may be, may
delegate to any officer or other appropriate person of a Plan Sponsor the
authority to take any such actions as may be specified in such resolution
or written direction, other than the power to amend, modify or terminate
the Plan or the Trust or to determine the basis of any Plan Sponsor
contributions.


                          SECTION 10
                    CLAIM REVIEW PROCEDURE

     10.1  If a Member or Beneficiary is denied a claim for benefits
under a Plan, the Plan Administrator shall provide to the claimant written
notice of the denial within 90 days after the Plan Administrator receives
the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for
processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is
required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the
claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period.  In no
event shall the extension exceed a period of 90 days from the end of such
initial period.  The extension notice shall indicate the special
circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the
Plan Administrator expects to render the final decision.

     10.2  If the claimant is denied a claim for benefits, the Plan
Administrator shall provide, within the time frame set forth in Plan
Section 10.1, written notice of the denial which shall set forth:

          (a)  the specific reasons for the denial;

          (b)  specific references to the pertinent provisions of the
     Plan on which the denial is based;

          (c)  a description of any additional material or information
     necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation
     of why the material or information is necessary; and

          (d)  an explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.

     10.3  After receiving written notice of the denial of a claim, a
claimant or his representative may:

          (a)  request a full and fair review of the denial by written
     application to the Plan Administrator;

          (b)  review pertinent documents; and

          (c)  submit issues and comments in writing to the Plan
     Administrator.

     10.4  If the claimant wishes a review of the decision denying his
claim to benefits under the Plan, he must submit the written application
to the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after receiving written
notice of the denial.

     10.5  Upon receiving the written application for review, the Plan
Administrator may schedule a hearing for purposes of reviewing the
claimant's claim, which hearing shall take place not more than thirty (30)
days from the date on which the Plan Administrator received the written
application for review.

     10.6  At least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the
claimant and his representative designated in writing by him, if any,
shall receive written notice of the date, time, and place of the scheduled
hearing.  The claimant or his representative may request that the hearing
be rescheduled for his convenience on another reasonable date or at
another reasonable time or place.

     10.7  All claimants requesting a review of the decision denying
their claim for benefits may employ counsel for purposes of the hearing.

     10.8  No later than sixty (60) days following the receipt of the
written application for review, the Plan Administrator shall submit its
decision on the review in writing to the claimant involved and to his
representative, if any; provided, however, a decision on the written
application for review may be extended, in the event special circumstances
such as the need to hold a hearing require an extension of time, to a day
no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of receipt of
the written application for review.  The decision shall include specific
reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent
provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based.


                          SECTION 11
         LIMITATION OF ASSIGNMENT, PAYMENTS TO LEGALLY
        INCOMPETENT DISTRIBUTEE AND UNCLAIMED PAYMENTS

     11.1  No benefit which shall be payable under the Plan to any
person shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge
the same shall be void; and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable
for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of any person, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal
process for, or against, such person, and the same shall not be recognized
under the Plan, except to such extent as may be required by law. 
Notwithstanding the above, this Plan Section shall not apply to a
"qualified domestic relations order" (as defined in Code Section 414(p)),
and benefits may be paid pursuant to the provisions of such an order.  The
Plan Administrator shall develop procedures (in accordance with applicable
federal regulations) to determine whether a domestic relations order is
qualified, and, if so, the method and the procedures for complying
therewith. 

     11.2  If any person who shall be entitled to any benefit under the
Plan shall become bankrupt or shall attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge such benefit under the Plan,
then the payment of any such benefit in the event a Member or Beneficiary
is entitled to payment shall, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator,
cease and terminate and in that event the Trustee shall hold or apply the
same for the benefit of such person, his spouse, children, other
dependents or any of them in such manner and in such proportion as the
Plan Administrator shall determine.

     11.3  Whenever any benefit which shall be payable under the Plan is
to be paid to or for the benefit of any person who is then a minor or
determined to be incompetent by qualified medical advice, the Plan
Administrator need not require the appointment of a guardian or custodian,
but shall be authorized to cause the same to be paid over to the person
having custody of such minor or incompetent, or to cause the same to be
paid to such minor or incompetent without the intervention of a guardian
or custodian, or to cause the same to be paid to a legal guardian or
custodian of such minor or incompetent if one has been appointed or to
cause the same to be used for the benefit of such minor or incompetent.

     11.4  If the Plan Administrator cannot ascertain the whereabouts of
any Member to whom a payment is due under the Plan, the Plan Administrator
may direct that the payment and all remaining payments otherwise due to
the Member be cancelled on the records of the Plan and the amount thereof
applied as a forfeiture to reduce Plan Sponsor contributions, except that,
in the event the Member later notifies the Plan Administrator of his
whereabouts and requests the payments due to him under the Plan, the Plan
Sponsor shall contribute to the Plan an amount equal to the payment to be
paid to him as soon as administratively feasible.


                          SECTION 12
                 PROHIBITION AGAINST DIVERSION

     At no time shall any part of the Fund be used for or diverted to
purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the Members or their
Beneficiaries, subject, however, to the payment of all taxes and
administrative expenses and subject to the provisions of the Plan with
respect to returns of contributions.


                          SECTION 13
                     LIMITATION OF RIGHTS

     Membership in the Plan shall not give any Employee any right or
claim except to the extent that such right is specifically fixed under the
terms of the Plan.  The adoption of the Plan and the Trust by any Plan
Sponsor shall not be construed to give any Employee a right to be
continued in the employ of a Plan Sponsor or as interfering with the right
of a Plan Sponsor to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time.


                          SECTION 14
              AMENDMENT TO OR TERMINATION OF THE
                      PLAN AND THE TRUST

     14.1  The Primary Sponsor reserves the right at any time to modify
or amend or terminate the Plan or the Trust in whole or in part; provided,
however, that the Primary Sponsor shall have no power to modify or amend
the Plan in such manner as would cause or permit any portion of the funds
held under a Plan to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for
the exclusive benefit of Members or their Beneficiaries, or as would cause
or permit any portion of a fund held under the Plan to become the property
of a Plan Sponsor; and provided further, that the duties or liabilities of
the Trustee shall not be increased without its written consent.  No such
modifications or amendments shall have the effect of retroactively
changing or depriving Members or Beneficiaries of rights already accrued
under the Plan.  No Plan Sponsor other than the Primary Sponsor shall have
the right to so modify, amend or terminate the Plan or the Trust. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Plan Sponsor may terminate its own
participation in the Plan and Trust pursuant to the Plan.

     14.2  Each Plan Sponsor other than the Primary Sponsor shall have
the right to terminate its participation in the Plan and Trust by
resolution of its board of directors or other appropriate governing body
and notice in writing to the Primary Sponsor and the Trustee unless such
termination would result in the disqualification of the Plan or the Trust
or would adversely affect the exempt status of the Plan or the Trust as to
any other Plan Sponsor.  If contributions by or on behalf of a Plan
Sponsor are completely terminated, the Plan and Trust shall be deemed
terminated as to such Plan Sponsor.  Any termination by a Plan Sponsor,
shall not be a termination as to any other Plan Sponsor.

     14.3  (a) If the Plan is terminated by the Primary Sponsor or if
     contributions to the Trust should be permanently discontinued, it
     shall terminate as to all Plan Sponsors and the Fund shall be used,
     subject to the payment of expenses and taxes, for the benefit of
     Members and Beneficiaries, and for no other purposes, and the
     Account of each affected Member shall be fully vested and
     nonforfeitable, notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan Section
     which sets forth the vesting schedule.

          (b)  In the event of the partial termination of the Plan,
     each affected Member's Account shall be fully vested and
     nonforfeitable, notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan Section
     which sets forth the vesting schedule.

     14.4  In the event of the termination of the Plan or the Trust with
respect to a Plan Sponsor, the Accounts of the Members with respect to the
Plan as adopted by such Plan Sponsor shall be held subject to the
instructions of the Plan Administrator; provided that the Trustee shall
not be required to make any distribution until it receives a copy of an
Internal Revenue Service determination letter to the effect that the
termination does not affect the qualified status of the Plan or the exempt
status of the Trust or, in the event that such letter is applied for and
is not issued, until the Trustee is reasonably satisfied that adequate
provision has been made for the payment of all taxes which may be due and
owing by the Trust. 

     14.5  In the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with,
or any transfer of the assets or liabilities of the Plan to, any other
plan qualified under Code Section 401, the terms of the merger,
consolidation or transfer shall be such that each Member would receive (in
the event of termination of the Plan or its successor immediately
thereafter) a benefit which is no less than the benefit which the Member
would have received in the event of termination of the Plan immediately
before the merger, consolidation or transfer.

     14.6  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, an amendment
to the Plan --

          (a)  which eliminates or reduces an early retirement benefit,
     if any, or which eliminates or reduces a retirement-type subsidy (as
     defined in regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury), if
     any, or

          (b)  which eliminates an optional form of benefit

shall not be effective with respect to benefits attributable to service
before the amendment is adopted.  In the case of a retirement-type subsidy
described in Subsection (a) above, this Plan Section shall be applicable
only to a Member who satisfies, either before or after the amendment, the
preamendment conditions for the subsidy. 


                          SECTION 15
                ADOPTION OF PLAN BY AFFILIATES

     Any corporation or other business entity related to the Primary
Sponsor by function or operation and any Affiliate, if the corporation,
business entity or Affiliate is authorized to do so by written direction
adopted by the Board of Directors, may adopt the Plan and the related
Trust by action of the board of directors or other appropriate governing
body of such corporation, business entity or Affiliate.  Any adoption
shall be evidenced by certified copies of the resolutions of the foregoing
board of directors or governing body indicating the adoption and by the
execution of the Trust by the adopting corporation, or business entity or
Affiliate.  The resolution shall state and define the effective date of
the adoption of the Plan by the Plan Sponsor and, for the purpose of Code
Section 415, the "limitation year" as to such Plan Sponsor. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the Plan and Trust as adopted
by an Affiliate or other corporation or business entity under the
foregoing provisions shall fail to receive the initial approval of the
Internal Revenue Service as a qualified Plan and Trust under Code Sections
401(a) and 501(a), any contributions by the Affiliate or other corporation
or business entity after payment of all expenses will be returned to such
Plan Sponsor free of any trust, and the Plan and Trust shall terminate, as
to the adopting Affiliate or other corporation or business entity.


                          SECTION 16
           QUALIFICATION AND RETURN OF CONTRIBUTIONS

     16.1  If the Plan and the related Trust fail to receive the initial
approval of the Internal Revenue Service as a qualified plan and trust
within one (1) year after the date of denial of qualification (a) the
contribution of a Plan Sponsor after payment of all expenses will be
returned to a Plan Sponsor free of the Plan and Trust, (b) contributions
made by a Member shall be returned to the Member who made the
contributions, and (c) the Plan and Trust shall thereupon terminate.

     16.2  All Plan Sponsor contributions to the Plan are contingent
upon deductibility.  To the extent permitted by the Code and other
applicable laws and regulations thereunder, upon a Plan Sponsor's request,
a contribution which was made by reason of a mistake of fact or which was
nondeductible under Code Section 404, shall be returned to a Plan Sponsor
within one (1) year after the payment of the contribution, or the
disallowance of the deduction (to the extent disallowed), whichever is
applicable.

     In the event of a contribution which was made by reason of a mistake
of fact or which was nondeductible, the amount to be returned to the Plan
Sponsor shall be the excess of the contribution above the amount that
would have been contributed had the mistake of fact or the mistake in
determining the deduction not occurred, less any net loss attributable to
the excess.  Any net income attributable to the excess shall not be
returned to the Plan Sponsor.  No return of any portion of the excess
shall be made to the Plan Sponsor if the return would cause the balance in
a Member's Account to be less than the balance would have been had the
mistaken contribution not been made.


                          SECTION 17
         SECTION 16 OF SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the provisions of
this Plan that set forth the formula or formulas that determine the
amount, price or timing of awards to persons subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Act") and any other provisions of this Plan of the type referred to in
Section 16b-3(c)(2)(ii) of the Act shall not be amended more than once
every six months, other than to comport with changes in the Code, ERISA,
or the rules thereunder.  Further, to the extent required, the persons
described in the preceding sentence shall be subject to such withdrawal,
investment and other restrictions necessary to satisfy Rule 16b-3 under
the Act.  This Section 17 is intended to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the
Act and shall be effective only to the extent required by such rule and
shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with such rule.  


                          SECTION 18
             INCORPORATION OF SPECIAL LIMITATIONS

     Appendices A, B, and C to the Plan, attached hereto, are
incorporated by reference and the provisions of the same shall apply
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Primary Sponsor has caused this indenture to
be executed as of the date first above written.

                             APPENDIX A
                SPECIAL NONDISCRIMINATION RULES


                           SECTION 1

     As used in this Appendix, the following words shall have the
following meanings:

          (a)  "Eligible Member" means a Member who is an Employee
     during any particular Plan Year.

          (b)  "Highly Compensated Eligible Member" means any Eligible
     Member who is a Highly Compensated Employee.

          (c)  "Matching Contribution" means any contribution made by a
     Plan Sponsor to a Company Matching Account and any other
     contribution made to a plan by a Plan Sponsor or an Affiliate on
     behalf of an Employee on account of a contribution made by an
     Employee or on account of an Elective Deferral.

          (d)  "Qualified Matching Contributions" means Matching
     Contributions which are immediately nonforfeitable when made, and
     which would be nonforfeitable, regardless of the age or service of
     the Employee or whether the Employee is employed on a certain date,
     and which may not be distributed, except upon one of the events
     described under Code Section 401(k)(2)(B) and the regulations
     thereunder.

          (e)  "Qualified Nonelective Contributions" means
     contributions of the Plan Sponsor or an Affiliate, other than
     Matching Contributions or Elective Deferrals, which are non-
     forfeitable when made, and which would be nonforfeitable regardless
     of the age or service of the Employee or whether the Employee is
     employed on a certain date, and which may not be distributed, except
     upon one of the events described under Code Section 401(k)(2)(B) and
     the regulations thereunder.


                           SECTION 2

     In addition to any other limitations set forth in the Plan, for each
Plan Year one of the following tests must be satisfied:

          (a)  the actual deferral percentage for the Highly
     Compensated Eligible Members must not be more than the actual
     deferral percentage of all other Eligible Members multiplied by
     1.25; or

          (b)  the excess of the actual deferral percentage for the
     Highly Compensated Eligible Members over that of all other Eligible
     Members must not be more than two (2) percentage points, and the
     actual deferral percentage for the Highly Compensated Eligible
     Members must not be more than the actual deferral percentage of all
     other Eligible Members multiplied by two (2).

The "actual deferral percentage" for the Highly Compensated Eligible
Members and all other Eligible Members for a Plan Year is the average in
each group of the ratios, calculated separately for each Employee, of the
Deferral Amounts contributed by the Plan Sponsor on behalf of an Employee
for the Plan Year to the Annual Compensation of the Employee in the Plan
Year.  In addition, for purposes of calculating the "actual deferral
percentage" as described above, Deferral Amounts of Employees who are not
Highly Compensated Employees which are prohibited by Code Section
401(a)(30) shall not be taken into consideration.  Except to the extent
limited by Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(b)(5) and any other
applicable regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, all
or part of the Qualified Matching Contributions and Qualified Nonelective
Contributions made pursuant to the Plan may be treated as Deferral Amounts
for purposes of determining the "actual deferral percentage."


                           SECTION 3

     If the Deferral Amounts contributed on behalf of any Highly
Compensated Eligible Member exceeds the amount permitted under the "actual
deferral percentage" test described in Section 2 of this Appendix A for
any given Plan Year, then before the end of the Plan Year following the
Plan Year for which the Excess Deferral Amount was contributed, (a) the
amount of the Excess Deferral Amount for the Plan Year, as adjusted to
reflect income, gain, or loss attributable to it through the date the
Excess Deferral Amount is distributed to the Member and reduced by any
excess Elective Deferrals as determined pursuant to Plan Section 3.1
previously distributed to the Member for the Member's taxable year ending
with or within the Plan Year, may be distributed to the Highly Compensated
Eligible Member or (b) to the extent provided in regulations issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury, the Plan Administrator may, in its discretion,
allow each affected Member to elect, within two and one-half months after
the end of the Plan Year for which the Excess Deferral Amount was
contributed, to treat the Excess Deferral Amount, unadjusted for earnings,
gains, and losses, but as so reduced, as an amount distributed to the
Member and then contributed as an after-tax contribution by the Member to
the Plan ("recharacterized amounts").  The income allocable to such Excess
Deferral Amount shall be determined in a similar manner as described in
Plan Section 4.2.  The Excess Deferral Amount to be distributed or
recharacterized shall be reduced by Deferral Amounts previously
distributed or recharacterized for the taxable year ending in the same
Plan Year, and shall also be reduced by Deferral Amounts previously
distributed or recharacterized for the Plan Year beginning in such taxable
year.  For all other purposes under the Plan other than this Appendix A
recharacterized amounts shall continue to be treated as Deferral Amounts. 
In the event the multiple use of limitations contained in Sections 2(b)
and 5(b) of this Appendix, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.401(m)-2 as promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, requires a
corrective distribution, such distribution shall be made pursuant to this
Section 3, and not Section 6 of Appendix A.

For purposes of this Section 3, "Excess Deferral Amount" means, with
respect to a Plan Year, the excess of:

          (a)  the aggregate amount of Deferral Amounts contributed by
     a Plan Sponsor on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Members for
     the Plan Year, over

          (b)  the maximum amount of Deferral Amounts permitted under
     Section 2 of this Appendix A for the Plan Year, which shall be
     determined by reducing the Deferral Amounts contributed on behalf of
     Highly Compensated Eligible Members in order of the actual deferral
     percentages beginning with the highest of such percentages.

Distribution of the Excess Deferral Amounts for any Plan Year shall be
made to the Highly Compensated Eligible Members on the basis of the
respective portions of the Excess Deferral Amount attributable to each
Highly Compensated Eligible Member.  As to any Highly Compensated Employee
who is subject to the family aggregation rules of Subsection (b) of the
Plan Section containing the definition of the term "Highly Compensated
Employee," any distribution of such Highly Compensated Employee's
allocable portion of the Excess Deferral Amount for a Plan Year shall be
allocated among the family members of such Highly Compensated Employee who
are combined to determine the actual deferral percentage in proportion to
the Deferral Amounts taken into account under this Section 3.


                           SECTION 4

     The Plan Administrator shall have the responsibility of monitoring
the Plan's compliance with the limitations of this Appendix A and shall
have the power to take all steps it deems necessary or appropriate to
ensure compliance, including, without limitation, restricting the amount
which Highly Compensated Eligible Members can elect to have contributed
pursuant to Plan Section 3.1.  Any actions taken by the Plan Administrator
pursuant to this Section 4 shall be pursuant to non-discriminatory
procedures consistently applied.


                           SECTION 5

     In addition to any other limitations set forth in the Plan, Matching
Contributions under the Plan and the amount of nondeductible employee
contributions under the Plan, for each Plan Year must satisfy one of the
following tests:

          (a)  The contribution percentage for Highly Compensated
     Eligible Members must not exceed 125% of the contribution percentage
     for all other Eligible Members; or

          (b)  The contribution percentage for Highly Compensated
     Eligible Members must not exceed the lesser of (1) 200% of the
     contribution percentage for all other Eligible Members, and (2) the
     contribution percentage for all other Eligible Members plus two (2)
     percentage points.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Section 5, the terms
Highly Compensated Eligible Member and Eligible Member shall not include
any Member who is not eligible to receive a Matching Contribution under
the provisions of the Plan, other than as a result of the Member failing
to contribute to the Plan or failing to have an Elective Deferral
contributed to the Plan on the Member's behalf.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Qualified Matching Contributions are taken into account for
purposes of applying the test contained in Section 2 of this Appendix A,
they shall not be taken into account under this Section 5.  In applying
the above tests, the Plan Administrator shall comply with any regulations
promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury which prevent or restrict the
use of the test contained in Section 2(b) of this Appendix A and the test
contained in Section 5(b) of this Appendix A.  The "contribution
percentage" for Highly Compensated Eligible Members and for all other
Eligible Members for a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios,
calculated separately for each Member, of (A) to (B), where (A) is the
amount of Matching Contributions under the Plan (excluding Qualified
Matching Contributions which are used to apply the test set forth in
Section 2 of this Appendix A or Matching Contributions which are used to
satisfy the minimum required contributions to the Accounts of Eligible
Members who are not Key Employees pursuant to Section 1 of Appendix C to
the Plan) and nondeductible employee contributions made under the Plan for
the Eligible Member for the Plan Year, and where (B) is the Annual
Compensation of the Eligible Member for the Plan Year.  Except to the
extent limited by Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(m)-1(b)(5) and any
other applicable regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury,
a Plan Sponsor may elect to treat Deferral Amounts and Qualified
Nonelective Contributions as Matching Contributions for purpose of
determining the "contribution percentage," provided the Deferral Amounts,
excluding those treated as Matching Contributions, satisfy the test set
forth in Section 2 of Appendix A. 


                           SECTION 6

     If the Matching Contributions and nondeductible employee
contributions and, if taken into account under Section 5 of this
Appendix A, the Deferral Amounts made by or on behalf of Highly
Compensated Eligible Members exceed the amount permitted under the
"contribution percentage test" for any given Plan Year, then, before the
close of the Plan Year following the Plan Year for which the excess
aggregate contributions were made, the amount of the excess aggregate
contributions attributable to the Plan for the Plan Year, as adjusted to
reflect any income, gain or loss attributable to such contributions
through the date the excess aggregate contributions are distributed, shall
be distributed.  The income allocable to such contributions shall be
determined in a similar manner as described in Plan Section 4.2.  As to
any Highly Compensated Employee, any distribution of his allocable portion
of the excess aggregate contributions for a Plan Year shall first be
attributed to any nondeductible employee contributions made by the Member
during the Plan Year for which no corresponding Plan Sponsor contribution
is made and then to any remaining nondeductible employee contributions
made by the Member during the Plan Year and any Matching Contributions
thereon.  As between the Plan and any other plan or plans maintained by
the Plan Sponsor in which excess aggregate contributions for a Plan Year
are held, each such plan shall distribute a pro-rata share of each class
of contribution based on the respective amounts of a class of contribution
made to each plan during the Plan Year.  The payment of the excess
aggregate contributions shall be made without regard to any other
provision in the Plan.  In the event the multiple use of limitations
contained in Sections 2(b) and 5(b) of this Appendix, pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.401(m)-2 as promulgated by the Secretary of the
Treasury, requires a corrective distribution, such distribution shall be
made pursuant to Section 3 of Appendix A, and not this Section 6.

     For purposes of this Section 6, with respect to any Plan Year,
"excess aggregate contributions" means the excess of:

          (a)  the aggregate amount of the Matching Contributions and
     nondeductible employee contributions and, if taken into account
     under Section 5 of this Appendix A, the Deferral Amounts actually
     made on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Members for the Plan
     Year, over

          (b)  the maximum amount of the contributions permitted under
     the limitations of Section 5 of this Appendix A, determined by
     reducing contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible
     Members in order of their contribution percentages beginning with
     the highest of such percentages.

Distribution of nondeductible employee contributions or Matching
Contributions in the amount of the excess aggregate contributions for any
Plan Year shall be made with respect to Highly Compensated Employees on
the basis of the respective portions of the excess aggregate contributions
attributable to each Highly Compensated Employee.  As to any Highly
Compensated Employee who is subject to the family aggregation rules of
Subsection (b) of the Plan Section containing the definition of the term
"Highly Compensated Employee," any distribution of such Highly Compensated
Employee's allocable portion of the excess aggregate contributions for a
Plan Year shall be allocated among the family members of such Highly
Compensated Employee which are combined to determine the contribution
percentage in proportion to the contributions taken into account under
this Section 6.

The determination of the amount of excess aggregate contributions under
this Section 6 shall be made after (1) first determining the excess
Elective Deferrals under Plan Section 3.1(b), and (2) then determining the
Excess Deferral Amounts under Section 3 of this Appendix A.


                           SECTION 7

     Except to the extent limited by rules promulgated by the Secretary
of the Treasury, if a Highly Compensated Eligible Member is a participant
in any other plan of the Plan Sponsor or any Affiliate which includes
Matching Contributions, deferrals under a cash or deferred arrangement
pursuant to Code Section 401(k), or nondeductible employee contributions,
any contributions made by or on behalf of the Member to the other plan
shall be allocated with the same class of contributions under the Plan for
purposes of determining the "actual deferral percentage" and "contribution
percentage" under the Plan; provided, however, contributions that are made
under an "employee stock ownership plan" (within the meaning of Code
Section 4975(e)(7)) shall not be combined with contributions under any
plan which is not an employee stock ownership plan (within the meaning of
Code Section 4975(e)(7)).

     Except to the extent limited by rules promulgated by the Secretary
of the Treasury, if the Plan and any other plans which include Matching
Contributions, deferrals under a cash or deferred arrangement pursuant to
Code Section 401(k), or nondeductible employee contributions are
considered as one plan for purposes of Code Section 401(a)(4) and
410(b)(1), any contributions under the other plans shall be allocated with
the same class of contributions under the Plan for purposes of determining
the "contribution percentage" and "actual deferral percentage" under the
Plan; provided, however, contributions that are made under an "employee
stock ownership plan" (within the meaning of Code Section 4975(e)(7))
shall not be combined with contributions under any plan which is not an
employee stock ownership plan (within the meaning of Code Section
4975(e)(7)).

                          APPENDIX B
                   LIMITATION ON ALLOCATIONS


                           SECTION 1

     The "annual addition" for any Member for any one limitation year may
not exceed the lesser of:

          (a)  $30,000 (or, if greater, one-quarter of the dollar
     limitation in effect under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A)), adjusted for
     changes in the cost of living as provided in regulations issued by
     the Secretary of the Treasury); or 

          (b)  25% of the Member's Annual Compensation.


                           SECTION 2

     For the purposes of this Appendix B, the term "annual addition" for
any Member means for any limitation year, the sum of certain Plan Sponsor
and Member contributions, and other amounts as determined in Code
Section 415(c)(2) in effect for that limitation year.


                           SECTION 3

     In the event that a Plan Sponsor maintains a defined benefit plan
under which a Member also participates, the sum of the defined benefit
plan fraction and the defined contribution plan fraction for any
limitation year for any Member may not exceed 1.0. 

          (a)  The defined benefit plan fraction for any limitation
     year is a fraction: 

               (1)  the numerator of which is the projected annual
          benefit of the Member under the defined benefit plan
          (determined as of the close of such year); and

               (2)  the denominator of which is the lesser of

                    (A)  the product of 1.25, multiplied by the
               maximum annual benefit allowable under Code
               Section 415(b)(1)(A), or

                    (B)  the product of

                          (i)  1.4, multiplied by

                         (ii)  the amount which may be taken into
                    account under Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) (or Code
                    Section 415(c)(7), if applicable) with respect to the
                    Member for the limitation year.


                           SECTION 6

     For purposes of this Appendix B, the term "limitation year" shall mean
a Plan Year unless a Plan Sponsor elects, by adoption of a written resolution,
to use any other twelve-month period adopted in accordance with regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.  For purposes of applying the
limitations set forth in this Appendix B, the term "Plan Sponsor" shall mean
a Plan Sponsor and any other corporations which are members of the same
controlled group of corporations (as described in Code Section 414(b), as
modified by Code Section 415(h)) as is a Plan Sponsor, any other trades or
businesses (whether or not incorporated) under common control (as described
in Code Section 414(c), as modified by Code Section 415(h)) with a Plan
Sponsor, any other corporations, partnerships, or other organizations which
are members of an affiliated service group (as described in Code
Section 414(m)) with a Plan Sponsor, and any other entity required to be
aggregated with a Plan Sponsor pursuant to regulations under Code
Section 414(o).


                          SECTION I.

     For purposes of applying the limitations of this Appendix B, all defined
contribution plans maintained or deemed to be maintained by a Plan Sponsor
shall be treated as one defined contribution plan, and all defined benefit
plans now or previously maintained or deemed to be maintained by a Plan
Sponsor shall be treated as one defined benefit plan.  In the event any of the
actions to be taken pursuant to Section 6 of this Appendix or pursuant to any
language of similar import in another defined contribution plan are required
to be taken as a result of the annual additions of a Member exceeding the
limitations set forth in Section 1 of this Appendix because of the Member's
participation in more than one defined contribution plan, the actions shall
first be taken with respect to this Plan.


                          SECTION II.

     In the event that as a result of a reasonable error in estimating the
Member's Annual Compensation, the annual addition allocated to the Account of
a Member exceeds the limitations set forth in Section 1 of this Appendix B or
in the event that the aggregate contributions made on behalf of a Member under
both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan, subject to the
reduction of allocations in other defined contribution plans required by
Section 5 of this Appendix B, cause the aggregate limitation fraction set
forth in Section 3 of this Appendix B to be exceeded, the Plan Administrator
shall, in writing, direct the Trustee to take such of the following actions
as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate, specifying in each case the
amount or amounts of contributions involved:

          1.   A Member's annual addition shall be reduced by distributing
     to the Member Voluntary Contributions made by the Member which cause the
     annual addition to exceed such limitations;

          2.   If further reduction is necessary, contributions made by the
     Plan Sponsor on behalf of the Member pursuant to Plan Section 3.1 with
     respect to which no contribution is made under Plan Section 3.2 shall
     be reduced in the amount of the remaining excess and distributed to the
     Member;

          3.   If further reduction is necessary, contributions made by the
     Plan Sponsor on behalf of the Member pursuant to Plan Section 3.1 and
     contributions of the Plan Sponsor thereon pursuant to Plan Section 3.2
     shall be reduced in the amount of the remaining excess.  The amount of
     the reduction under Plan Section 3.1 shall be distributed to the Member. 
     The amount of the reduction under Plan Section 3.2 shall be reallocated
     to the Company Matching Accounts of Members who are not affected by the
     limitation in the same proportion as the contribution of the Plan
     Sponsor for the year is allocated under Plan Section 4.1 to the Accounts
     of such Members; and

          4.   If the contribution of the Plan Sponsor would cause the
     annual addition to exceed the limitations set forth herein with respect
     to all Members under the Plan, the portion of such contribution in
     excess of the limitations shall be segregated in a suspense account. 
     While the suspense account is maintained, (1) no Plan Sponsor
     contributions under the Plan shall be made which would be precluded by
     this Appendix B, (2) income, gains and loses of the Fund shall not be
     allocated to such suspense account and (3) amounts in the suspense
     account shall be allocated in the same manner as Plan Sponsor
     contributions under the Plan as of each Valuation Date on which Plan
     Sponsor contributions may be allocated until the suspense account is
     exhausted.  In the event of the termination of the Plan, the amounts in
     the suspense account shall be returned to the Plan Sponsor to the extent
     that such amounts may not then be allocated to the Members' Accounts.

               which, as of the Determination Date:

                          (i)  the present value of the cumulative
                    Accrued Benefits under the Plan for all Key Employees
                    exceeds 60 percent of the present value of the
                    cumulative Accrued Benefits under the Plan for all
                    Members; and

                         (ii)  the Plan, when included in every
                    potential combination, if any, with any or all of:

                               (I)  any Required Aggregation Group, and

                              (II)  any plan of the Plan Sponsor which

                         and which qualifies under Code Section 401 (a) 

                    is part of a Top-Heavy Group (as defined in
                    Paragraph (2) of this Subsection); and

                    (B)  if the Plan is included in a Required

               which, as of the Determination Date:

                          (i)  the Required Aggregation Group is a
                    Top-Heavy Group (as defined in Paragraph (2) of this
                    Subsection); and

                         (ii)  the Required Aggregation Group, when
                    included in every potential combination, if any, with
                    any or all of the plans of the Plan Sponsor and its
                    Affiliates which are not part of the Required
                    Aggregation Group and which qualify under Code
                    Section 401(a), is part of a Top-Heavy Group (as
                    defined in Paragraph (2) of this Subsection).

                    (C)  For purposes of Subparagraphs (A)(ii) and
               (B)(ii) of this Paragraph (1), any combination of plans
               must satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4)
               and 410.

               (2)  A group shall be deemed to be a Top-Heavy Group if: 

                    (A)  the sum, as of the Determination Date, of the
               present value of the cumulative accrued benefits for all
               Key Employees under all plans included in such group
               exceeds

                    (B)  60 percent of a similar sum determined for all
               participants in such plans.

               (3)  (A)  For purposes of this Section, the present value
               of the accrued benefit for any participant in a defined
               contribution plan as of any Determination Date or last day
               of a plan year shall be the sum of:

                           (i)  as to any defined contribution plan
                    other than a simplified employee pension, the account
                    balance as of the most recent valuation date
                    occurring within the plan year ending on the
                    Determination Date or last day of a plan year, and

                          (ii)  as to any simplified employee pension,
                    the aggregate employer contributions, and

                         (iii)  an adjustment for contributions due as
                    of the Determination Date or last day of a plan year.

               In the case of a plan that is not subject to the minimum
               funding requirements of Code Section 412, the adjustment in
               Clause (iii) of this Subparagraph (A) shall be the amount
               of any contributions actually made after the valuation date
               but on or before the Determination Date or last day of the
               plan year to the extent not included under Clause (i) or
               (ii) of this Subparagraph (A); provided, however, that in
               the first plan year of the plan, the adjustment in
               Clause (iii) of this Subparagraph (A) shall also reflect
               the amount of any contributions made thereafter that are
               allocated as of a date in such first plan year.  In the
               case of a plan that is subject to the minimum funding
               requirements, the account balance in Clause (i) and the
               aggregate contributions in Clause (ii) of this
               Subparagraph (A) shall include contributions that would be
               allocated as of a date not later than the Determination
               Date or last day of a plan year, even though those amounts
               are not yet required to be contributed, and the adjustment
               in Clause (iii) of this Subparagraph (A) shall be the
               amount of any contribution actually made (or due to be
               made) after the valuation date but before the expiration of
               the extended payment period in Code Section 412(c)(10) to
               the extent not included under Clause (i) or (ii) of this
               Subparagraph (A).

                    (B)  For purposes of this Subsection, the present
               value of the accrued benefit for any participant in a
               defined benefit plan as of any Determination Date or last
               day of a plan year must be determined as of the most recent
               valuation date which is within a 12-month period ending on
               the Determination Date or last day of a plan year as if
               such participant terminated as of such valuation date;
               provided, however, that in the first plan year of a plan,
               the present value of the accrued benefit for a current
               participant must be determined either (i) as if the
               participant terminated service as of the Determination Date
               or last day of a plan year or (ii) as if the participant
               terminated service as of such valuation date, but taking
               into account the estimated accrued benefit as of the
               Determination Date or last day of a plan year.  For
               purposes of this Subparagraph (B), the valuation date must
               be the same valuation date used for computing plan costs
               for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation is
               performed that year.  The actuarial assumptions utilized in
               calculating the present value of the accrued benefit for
               any participant in a defined benefit plan for purposes of
               this Subparagraph (B) shall be established by the Plan
               Administrator after consultation with the actuary for the
               plan, and shall be reasonable in the aggregate and shall
               comport with the requirements set forth by the Internal
               Revenue Service in Q&A T-26 and T-27 of Regulation
               Section 1.416-1.

                    (C)  For purposes of determining the present value
               of the cumulative accrued benefit under a plan for any
               participant in accordance with this Subsection, the present
               value shall be increased by the aggregate distributions
               made with respect to the participant (including
               distributions paid on account of death to the extent they
               do not exceed the present value of the cumulative accrued
               benefit existing immediately prior to death) under each
               plan being considered, and under any terminated plan which
               if it had not been terminated would have been in a Required
               Aggregation Group with the Plan, during the 5-year period
               ending on the Determination Date or last day of the plan
               year that falls within the calendar year in which the
               Determination Date falls.

                    (D)  For purposes of this Paragraph (3), participant
               contributions which are deductible as "qualified retirement
               contributions" within the meaning of Code Section 219 or
               any successor, as adjusted to reflect income, gains,
               losses, and other credits or charges attributable thereto,
               shall not be considered to be part of the accrued  benefits
               under any plan.

                    (E)  For purposes of this Paragraph (3), if any
               employee is not a Key Employee with respect to any plan for
               any plan year, but such employee was a Key Employee with
               respect to such plan for any prior plan year, any accrued
               benefit for such employee shall not be taken into account.

                    (F)  For purposes of this Paragraph (3), if any
               employee has not performed any service for any Plan Sponsor
               or Affiliate maintaining the plan during the five-year
               period ending on the Determination Date, any accrued
               benefit for that employee shall not be taken into account.

                    (G)  (i)  In the case of an "unrelated rollover"
                    (as defined below) between plans which qualify under
                    Code Section 401(a), (a) the plan providing the
                    distribution shall count the distribution as a
                    distribution under Subparagraph (C) of this
                    Paragraph (3), and (b) the plan accepting the
                    distribution shall not consider the distribution part
                    of the accrued benefit under this Section; and

                         (ii) in the case of a "related rollover" (as
                    defined below) between plans which qualify under Code
                    Section 401(a), (a) the plan providing the
                    distribution shall not count the distribution as a
                    distribution under Subparagraph (C) of this
                    Paragraph (3), and (b) the plan accepting the
                    distribution shall consider the distribution part of
                    the accrued benefit under this Section.

For purposes of this Subparagraph (G), an "unrelated rollover" is a rollover
as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4) or 408(d)(3) or a plan-to-plan transfer
which is both initiated by the participant and made from a plan maintained by
one employer to a plan maintained by another employer where the employers are
not Affiliates.  For purposes of this Subparagraph (G), a "related rollover"
is a rollover as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4) or 408(d)(3) or a
plan-to-plan transfer which is either not initiated by the participant or made
to a plan maintained by the employer or an Affiliate.


                           SECTION 2

          (a)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the
     contrary, except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b) of this
     Section, in any Plan Year during which the Plan is Top-Heavy,
     allocations of Plan Sponsor contributions for the Plan Year for the
     Account of each Member who is not a Key Employee and who has not
     separated from service with the Plan Sponsor prior to the end of the
     Plan Year shall not be less than 3 percent of the Member's Annual
     Compensation.  For purposes of this Subsection, an allocation to a
     Member's Account resulting from any Plan Sponsor contribution
     attributable to a salary reduction or similar arrangement shall not be
     taken into account.

          (b)  (1)  The percentage referred to in Subsection (a) of this
          Section for any Plan Year shall not exceed the percentage at which
          allocations are made or required to be made under the Plan for the
          Plan Year for the Key Employee for whom the percentage is highest
          for the Plan Year.  For purposes of this Paragraph, an allocation
          to the Account of a Key Employee resulting from any Plan Sponsor
          contribution attributable to a salary reduction or similar
          agreement shall be taken into account.

               (2)  For purposes of this Subsection (b), all defined
          contribution plans which are members of a Required Aggregation
          Group shall be treated as part of the Plan.

               (3)  This Subsection (b) shall not apply to any plan which
          is a member of a Required Aggregation Group if the plan enables
          a defined benefit plan which is a member of the Required
          Aggregation Group to meet the requirements of Code Section
          401(a)(4) or 410. 

               (4)  If the Plan Sponsor maintains a defined benefit plan
          which is qualified under Code Section 401(a) and which would be
          Top-Heavy within the meaning of the Plan for its plan year ending
          within or coincident with the Plan Year, no allocation shall be
          made pursuant to Subsection (a) of this Section on behalf of any
          Member who participates in the defined benefit plan and acquires
          a year of service within the meaning of paragraphs (4), (5) and
          (6) of Code Section 411(a) under the defined benefit plan for the
          plan year, if the defined benefit plan provides generally that the
          accrued benefit of the member when expressed as an annual
          retirement benefit shall not, when expressed as a percentage of
          the Member's compensation, be less than the lesser of (A) 2
          percent multiplied by the number of such Years of Service in plan
          years during which such plan was Top-Heavy, or (B) 20 percent.


                           SECTION 3

     In any limitation year (as defined in Section 4 of Appendix B to the
Plan) which contains any portion of a Plan Year in which the Plan is Top-
Heavy, the number "1.0" shall be substituted for the number "1.25" in Section
3 of Appendix B to the Plan.


                           SECTION 4

     Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, in any
Plan Year during which the Plan is Top-Heavy, a Member's interest in his
Accrued Benefit shall not vest at any rate which is slower than the following
schedule, effective as of the first day of that Plan Year: 

          Full Years               Percentage
          of Service                 Vested

          Less than 3                    0%
          3 or more                    100%

The Schedule set forth above in this Section 4 shall be inapplicable to a
Member who has failed to perform an Hour of Service after the Determination
Date on which the Plan has become Top-Heavy.  When the Plan ceases to be Top-
Heavy, the Schedule set forth above in this Section 4 shall cease to apply;
provided however, that the provisions of the Plan Section dealing with changes
in the vesting schedule shall apply.

                        TRUST AGREEMENT
                            TO THE
                   MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC.
                     SALARY DEFERRAL PLAN


     THIS TRUST AGREEMENT made as of the  31  day of December, 1993, by and
between MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC., f/k/a/ Morrison Incorporated, a
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware
(the "Primary Sponsor"); each other Affiliate or other entity adopting the
Morrison Restaurants Inc. Salary  Deferral Plan (the "Plan"), as provided
therein and executing this trust pursuant thereto; and AMSOUTH BANK N.A. of
Birmingham, Alabama (the "Trustee");


                     W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor maintains the Plan and related trust (the
"Trust"), which is intended to qualify as a profit sharing plan under section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and also contains a cash or deferred
arrangement as described in Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, for
the exclusive benefit of Members thereunder and their Beneficiaries; 

     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor and Trustee previously entered into
certain trust agreements reflecting the terms of the Trust, the most recent
of which was dated December 29, 1989 (the "Prior Trust Agreement"); 

     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor has restated the Plan, generally effective
January 1, 1989; and

     WHEREAS, the Primary Sponsor and Trustee desire to restate the Prior
Trust Agreement to make conforming amendments;


     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the further
obligations and undertakings as hereinafter set forth, the Primary Sponsor
and Trustee hereby amend and restate the Prior Trust Agreement, effective
January 1, 1994, as follows:


                           SECTION 1
                          DEFINITIONS

     All terms and definitions contained in the Plan are hereby incorporated
in the Trust Agreement by reference except to the extent that the terms of
the Trust Agreement clearly indicate to the contrary.


                          SECTION II
                           THE FUND

     The Primary Sponsor hereby establishes the Fund with the Trustee.  The
Fund shall be held, managed and administered by the Trustee in trust in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan and of the Trust without
distinction between principal and income.  At no time shall any part of the
Fund be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of
the Members or their Beneficiaries, subject, however, to the payment of taxes
and administrative expenses and to the return of contributions to a Plan
Sponsor under the specific conditions set forth in the Plan.


                          SECTION III
        MAINTENANCE OF AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ACCOUNTS

     A.   The Plan Administrator shall maintain Accounts in accordance with
the Plan. 

     B.   The Trustee may rely upon a notice given in accordance with the
terms of the Plan.  The Trustee shall not be charged with any notice unless
given in accordance with the Plan, including notification of any changes in
the identity or authority of any Fiduciary (other than the Trustee) or any
other person acting in regard to the Plan.

     C.   The Trustee shall make payments out of the Fund to the persons,
in the manner and in the amounts specified in written directions received by
it from the Plan Administrator.  The Plan Administrator assumes all
responsibility with respect to the directions and the application of the
payments.  The Trustee is under no duty to enforce payments of any
contributions to the Fund and is not responsible for the adequacy of the Fund
to discharge liabilities arising in connection with the Plan or Trust. 

     D.   If any dispute arises as to the persons to whom the payment of
any funds or delivery of any assets shall be made by the Trustee, the Trustee
may withhold the payment or delivery until the dispute has been determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction or has been settled by the parties
concerned and may, in its sole discretion, submit the dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction.  


                           SECTION 5
                          INVESTMENTS

     A.   Subject to the provisions of Sections V, VI and VIII hereof, the
Trustee agrees to invest the assets of the Fund with the care, skill and
diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting
in like capacity and familiar with such matters pursuant to the Trust would
use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.

     B.   Subject to the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement and the
provisions of ERISA, the Trustee shall invest the principal and income of the
Fund without distinction between principal and income, in such securities or
in such property, real, personal, or mixed and wherever situated, as the
Trustee in its sole discretion deems advisable.  Without limiting the
foregoing, the Trustee may make investments in, and may purchase, acquire,
obtain, retain, sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or encumber common or
preferred stocks, shares of mutual funds, trust and participation
certificates, bonds and mortgages, other evidences of indebtedness or
ownership, annuity contracts of life insurance companies, savings accounts
or plans, including, without limitation, savings accounts or plans
established by the Trustee, covered call options, put options, and financial
futures contracts, irrespective of whether the securities or property shall
be of a character authorized by applicable state law for trust investments.

     C.   The Trustee shall not invest in any securities issued by a Plan
Sponsor or any affiliate (as defined in ERISA Section 407(d)(7)) of a Plan
Sponsor unless the securities are "Qualifying Employer Securities," which
means (i) securities of a Plan Sponsor or any affiliate which are stock, or
(ii) a marketable obligation, as defined in ERISA Section 407(e), of a Plan
Sponsor or any affiliate.  Also, the Trustee shall not invest in any real
property leased to or used by a Plan Sponsor or any affiliate of a Plan
Sponsor unless the real property is "Qualifying Employer Real Property,"
which means parcels of real property and related personal property which are
leased to the Plan Sponsor or to any affiliate and which are geographically
dispersed and are suitable (or adaptable without excessive cost) for more
than one use.  The Trustee may invest up to one hundred percent (100%) of the
Fund in Qualifying Employer Securities, but shall not be required to invest
in either Qualifying Employer Securities or Qualifying Employer Real Property
if the Trustee makes a good faith determination that the investment would be
contrary to ERISA or the Code.

     D.   In addition to any other investments proper under the Trust, the
Trustee shall, after receiving written approval from the Primary Sponsor,
from time to time invest all or any part of the Fund in one or more group
trusts or collective investment funds (including, without limitation, such
trusts or funds now or hereafter established by the then Trustee and, more
specifically, the AmSouth Bancorporation Collective Investment Trust and the
funds maintained thereunder, including the General Equity Fund, the General
Fixed Income Fund, the General Intermediate Maturity Fund, the General
Limited Maturity Fund, and the Short-Term Investment Fund and the AmSouth
Master Money Market Account of AmSouth Bank N.A.) which contemplate the
commingling for investment purposes of the funds therein with trust assets
of other pension plans as defined in ERISA which are qualified under Code
Section 401 and which may be established by other businesses, institutions
and organizations other than the Trustee.  To the extent required by Revenue
Ruling 81-100 and to the extent consistent with the Trust, the terms and
provisions of the declaration of trust creating any group trust or collective
investment fund in which the Fund is invested are hereby adopted and made a
part hereof, and any part of the Fund so invested shall be subject to all of
the terms and provisions of any declaration of trust creating the group trust
or collective investment fund.  The Trustee shall from time to time withdraw
from the group trust or collective investment fund such part of the Fund, as
the Primary Sponsor directs.

     E.   The Trustee shall invest the assets of the Plan allocated to
Company Matching Accounts primarily in shares of Qualifying Employer
Securities; otherwise, the normal investment goals and objectives of the
Trustee are capital growth, conservation of principal and production of
income through the receipt of interest or dividends from investments.


                           SECTION 6
                      INVESTMENT MANAGER

     A.   If an Investment Manager is designated in accordance with the
Plan, the Trustee shall either (1) turn over to the Investment Manager for
investment all or such portion of the Fund as is specified in a written
direction to the Trustee from the Primary Sponsor, in which case the assets
shall continue to be a part of the Fund, even though not in the Trustee's
possession, or (2) invest and reinvest all or such portion of the Fund as is
specified in a written direction to the Trustee from the Primary Sponsor in
the manner in which the Investment Manager directs the Trustee in writing. 
In either event, whether the Trustee actually gives the Investment Manager
possession of a portion of the Fund or is required to invest a portion of the
Fund as directed by the Investment Manager, the Trustee shall have no
discretion with respect to the investment or reinvestment of that portion of
the Fund and shall not be liable for that portion of the Fund or for any acts
or omissions of the Investment Manager or for following or for taking or
refraining from taking any action at any direction of the Investment Manager
given prior to receipt by the Trustee of written notice from the Primary
Sponsor of revocation of the designation of the Investment Manager or for the
failure of the Investment Manager to give a direction or for any act or
omission in connection with its failure.  The Trustee shall have no
responsibility for any assets of the Fund while in the possession of the
Investment Manager or while the assets have not been returned to the
possession of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon
notice of the designation of an Investment Manager from the Primary Sponsor
until notified in writing by the designating party that the designation is
no longer in effect.  

     B.   During any period of time in which an Investment Manager directs
the investment of a portion of the Fund, the Trustee, or its designated
agent, shall continue to receive all securities purchased against payment
therefor and to deliver all securities sold against receipt of the proceeds
therefrom.  Any Investment Manager authorized to direct investments may issue
orders on behalf of the Trustee for the purchase or sale of securities
directly to a broker or dealer and for such purpose the Trustee shall, upon
request, execute and deliver to the Investment Manager one or more trading
authorizations.  Written notification of the issuance of each order shall be
given promptly to the Trustee by the Investment Manager and the execution of
each order shall be confirmed by the broker to the Investment Manager and the
Trustee.  The notification shall be authority of the Trustee to receive
securities purchased against payment therefor and to deliver securities sold
against receipt of the proceeds therefrom.  All directions concerning invest-
ments of the Investment Manager shall be signed by any person acting on
behalf of the Investment Manager as may be duly authorized in writing.  The
transmission by the Investment Manager to the Trustee of directions by
photostatic teletransmission with duplicate or facsimile signatures shall be
considered a delivery in writing of the directions until the Trustee is
notified in writing by the Primary Sponsor that the use of any device
transmitting duplicate or facsimile signatures is no longer authorized.  The
Trustee may rely upon directions which it receives by photostatic
teletransmission prior to receipt of notice from the Primary Sponsor that
they are no longer authorized, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for
the consequences of any unauthorized use of a device which use was not known
by the Trustee at the time to be unauthorized.  

     C.   The Trustee shall be under no duty to make any review of
investments acquired for the Plan at the direction or order of an Investment
Manager or to make any recommendation with respect to disposing of or
continuing to retain any such investment.  

     D.   The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the existence
of any conversion, redemption, exchange, subscription or other right relating
to any securities purchased, of which notice was given prior to the purchase
of the securities, and shall have no obligation to exercise any right unless
the Trustee is informed of its existence by the Investment Manager and is
requested in writing by the Investment Manager to exercise the right within
a reasonable time before the time for its exercise expires.  

     E.   In the event that the Trustee is directed to purchase securities
issued by any foreign government or agency thereof, or by any corporation
domiciled outside of the continental limits of the United States or its
territories, it shall be the responsibility of the Investment Manager to
advise the Trustee in writing with respect to any laws or regulations of any
such foreign countries which shall apply to the securities, including, but
not limited to, receipt of dividends or interest by the Trustee from such
securities.


                           SECTION 7
                     INVESTMENT COMMITTEE

     A.   If an Investment Committee is designated by the Primary Sponsor
in accordance with the Plan, the Trustee shall, unless the Primary Sponsor
otherwise directs the Trustee in writing, invest the Fund as the Investment
Committee directs.  However, the Trustee shall only be subject to proper
directions of the Investment Committee which are made in accordance with the
terms of the Plan and which are not contrary to ERISA.

     B.   The Primary Sponsor may in writing direct that only a portion of
the Fund shall be invested as the Investment Committee directs, in which case
the Trustee shall invest the balance of the Fund pursuant to Section IV
hereof, subject to Sections V and VIII hereof.


                           SECTION 8
                        TRUSTEE POWERS

     In the administration of the Trust, in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any powers or authority of the Trustee under the Trust or
which the Trustee may have under applicable law in addition thereto (all such
additional powers and authority being specifically hereby granted to the
Trustee), the Trustee is authorized and empowered to do the following,
without advertisement and without order of court and without having to post
bond or make any returns or report of its doings to any court:

     A.   To purchase or subscribe for any securities or property,
including, without limitation, shares of mutual funds and to retain the same
in trust;

     B.   To sell, exchange, convey, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, any
securities or property held by it, by private contract or at public auction,
with or without advertising, and no person dealing with the Trustee shall be
bound to see to the application of the purchase money or to inquire into the
validity, expediency or propriety of any sale or other disposition;

     C.   To vote any stocks, bonds or other securities; to give general

changes affecting corporate securities, and to delegate discretionary powers,
and to pay any assessments or charges in connection therewith; and generally
to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds,
securities or other property held as part of the Fund; provided, however,
that the voting, tendering or similar rights with respect to any Qualifying
Employer Securities which are subject to investment direction by Members
shall be exercised by Members or, where applicable, their Beneficiaries;

     D.   To register any investment held as a part of the Fund in its own
name or in the name of a nominee, and to hold any investment in bearer form
or through or by a central clearing corporation maintained by institutions
active in the national securities markets, but the books and records of the
Trustee shall at all times show that all investments are part of the Fund;

     E.   To write covered call options and to purchase or sell put options
and financial futures contracts;

     F.   To employ and act through suitable agents, accountants,
appraisers and attorneys (who may be counsel for the Trustee) and to pay
their reasonable expenses and compensation, and the Trustee may consult with
counsel (who, without limitation, may be counsel to the Trustee or to a Plan
Sponsor), and shall be protected to the extent the law permits in acting upon
the advice of counsel in regard to legal questions, and may also employ
agents and expert assistants and delegate to them the ministerial duties
which it sees fit, in which event the Trustee shall periodically review the
performance of the persons to whom these duties have been delegated;

     G.   To borrow or raise money for the purposes of the Trust in such
amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee in its absolute
discretion may deem advisable; and for any sums so borrowed to issue its
promissory note as Trustee, and to secure the repayment thereof by pledging
all or any part of the Fund; and no person lending money to the Trustee shall
be bound to see to the application of the money lent or to inquire into the
validity, expediency or propriety of the borrowing;

     H.   To make, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all documents
of transfer and conveyance and all other instruments or agreements that may
be necessary or appropriate to carry out the powers of the Trustee under the
Trust or incidental thereto;

     I.   To settle, compromise or submit to arbitration any claims, debts
or damages due or owing to or from the Fund, to commence or defend any legal
or administrative proceedings arising, necessary or appropriate in connection
with the Plan, the Trust, the Fund, the administration thereof or the powers
or authority of the Trustee under the Trust, and to represent the Plan, the
Trust, and the Fund in all legal and administrative proceedings;

     J.   To keep such portions of the Fund in cash or cash balances as the
Trustee may deem to be in the best interest of the Trust, it being understood
that the Trustee shall not be required to pay any interest on any cash
balances; and

     K.   Generally, to do all acts and to execute and deliver all
instruments as in the judgment of the Trustee may be necessary or desirable
to carry out any powers or authority of the Trustee, without advertisement,
without order of court and without having to post bond or make any returns
or report of its doings to any court.


                           SECTION 9
                       INVESTMENT FUNDS

     A.   The assets of the Fund shall be invested in at least four (4)
Individual Funds, with varying investment objectives, as the Primary Sponsor
shall from time to time determine with consent of the Trustee.  One such
Individual Fund shall be established for investments in Qualifying Employee
Securities.

     B.   The Primary Sponsor, in its sole discretion may, from time to
time, establish one or more additional Individual Funds, or may change or
terminate the availability of any then existing Individual Fund or Individual
Funds for all Members, provided, however, that four (4) or more Individual
Funds remain available.

     C.   As to each of the Individual Funds, the Trustee shall be
authorized to purchase short-term investments pending the selection and
purchase of investments suitable for a particular Individual Fund.  The
decision of the Trustee as to whether or not an investment is of a type which
may be purchased for any Individual Fund shall be conclusive.  Pending the
selection and purchase of suitable investments, or the payment of expenses
or other anticipated distributions, the Trustee may retain in cash, without
liability for interest, such portion of an Individual Fund as it shall deem
reasonable under the circumstances.

     D.   The Trustee, at any time, may purchase for an Individual Fund any
property of another Individual Fund which would then be appropriate for
purchase by that Individual Fund and may exchange property of one Individual
Fund for property of another Individual Fund if the exchanged properties
would be appropriate for purchase by the respective Individual Funds.  Each
purchase or exchange shall be made at the fair market value of the property
so purchased or exchanged.

     E.   The terms and provisions of this Section shall not in any way
limit the authority, powers, and duties of the Trustee as set forth in this
Trust except to the extent that Section 404(c) of ERISA applies to the
investment election made by any Member pursuant to the Plan and Trust.  The
Trustee shall exercise or perform the same in regard to any Individual Fund
only in accordance with the purposes thereof.  Further, the authority,
powers, and duties of the Trustee shall be subject to the limitations
provided in Sections V and VI of the Trust if an Investment Manager or an
Investment Committee is appointed as provided therein, which Investment Mana-
ger or Investment Committee may be appointed in respect of all or a part of
any Individual Fund or the Fund, but shall exercise or perform its authority,
powers, and duties only in a manner consistent with the purpose of the
Individual Fund or the Fund, as the case may be.


                          SECTION 10
                INVESTMENT DIRECTION BY MEMBERS

     A.   Subject to any other rules and restrictions as the Plan
Administrator may prescribe from time to time, with respect to amounts
allocated to Employee Deferred Accounts and Rollover Accounts only, each
Member may (1) direct that a portion or all of his interest in one or more
of the Individual Funds be transferred to one or more of the other Individual
Funds or (2) change his election as to the Individual Funds in which future
contributions on his behalf to his Employee Deferred Account and Rollover
Account shall be invested.  The provisions of this Section are contingent
upon the availability of transfers among the Individual Funds under the terms
of the investments made by each Individual Fund.  An investment direction,
once given, shall be deemed to be a continuing direction until changed as
otherwise provided herein.

     B.   If no investment election is outstanding, all such contributions
shall be allocated to such Individual Fund as the Plan Administrator shall,
in its sole discretion, determine.

     C.   Investment directions by Members shall be subject to the
following:

          (a)  Each direction shall be on a form provided by the Plan
     Administrator, shall state the Individual Fund(s) to which all or a
     portion of the Member's Account shall be transferred, or, if
     applicable, shall state how future contributions shall be invested
     among the Individual Funds.

          (b)  Directions may be given effect for the immediately
     succeeding Valuation Date occurring after written notice is given if
     delivered to the Plan Administrator on or before the date required by
     the Plan Administrator.  Directions shall be effective only for the
     date in respect of which they are given, unless the Plan Administrator
     allows otherwise.

     D.  Each direction under the preceding paragraphs received by the Plan
Administrator shall be promptly delivered to the Trustee, and shall be
effective as to the Trustee only when received by the Trustee.  If a Member
directs that all or a portion of his Account be invested in a particular
Individual Fund, the Trustee shall use its best efforts to carry out the
investment as soon as practicable.  However, the Trustee shall never be held
liable for failure to carry out an investment direction within the terms of
the Trust if the Trustee has made a bona fide effort to follow the direction. 
 

     E.   Any distribution to a Member pursuant to the Plan shall be pro
rata from each Individual Fund in which he has an interest or in such other
manner determined by the Plan Administrator and applied uniformly.
     

                          SECTION 11
                   VALUATION AND ALLOCATION

     A.   For all purposes under the Plan and the Trust, including
particularly, but without limitation, valuing the Fund and each Member's
Account and allocating to each Member's Account its share of the net income
or net loss of the Fund, the following rules shall apply:

          (a)  Transfers or payments of funds or assets and the income,
     gain, loss, or expenses attributable thereto between Individual Funds
     shall be deemed made as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or
     immediately preceding the actual date of transfer or payment and the
     funds or assets shall not be credited or charged after such date with
     any earnings or losses of the Individual Fund from which transferred
     or paid but shall be credited or charged after such date with any
     earnings or losses of the Individual Fund to which transferred or paid.

          (b)  Transfers or payments from an Individual Fund to a Member
     or his Beneficiary between Valuation Dates shall be charged against the
     interest of the Member in the Individual Fund as of the next preceding
     Valuation Date and contributions to an Individual Fund which are
     allocated to the Account of a Member between Valuation Dates shall be
     credited to the interest of such Member in such Individual Fund as of
     the next succeeding Valuation Date. 

          (c)  Fair market value of the assets of each Individual Fund
     shall be determined separately and the net income or net loss of each
     Individual Fund shall be determined separately.  

          (d)  The value of a Member's Account, to the extent invested in
     Individual Funds, shall be the sum of his proportionate interests in
     each of the Individual Funds, and the aggregate net income or net loss
     allocated to a Member's Account shall be the aggregate of the net
     income or net loss allocated to his proportionate interests in each of
     the Individual Funds.

     B.   Subject to the provisions of Subsections C. and D. below, the
Trustee shall as of each Valuation Date, and at such additional times as the
Primary Sponsor may in writing direct, determine the net income or net loss
and the fair market value of the assets in the Fund and each Individual Fund,
respectively, as determined below:

          (e)  To the cash income, if any, since the last Valuation Date,
     there shall be added or subtracted, as the case may be, any net
     increase or decrease, since the last Valuation Date, in the fair market
     value of the assets of the Fund or Individual Fund, as applicable,
     since the last Valuation Date, any gain or loss on the sale or exchange
     of assets of the Fund or Individual Fund, as applicable, since the last
     Valuation Date, accrued interest since the last Valuation Date with
     respect to any interest-bearing security as to which the purchaser
     would be required to pay the accrued interest in addition to the quoted
     price, the amount of any dividend which shall have been declared since
     the last Valuation Date but not paid on shares of stock owned by the
     Trustee if the market quotation used in determining the value of such
     shares is ex-dividend, and the amount of any other assets of the Fund
     or Individual Fund determined by the Trustee to be income since the
     last Valuation date;

          (f)  From the sum thereof there shall be deducted all charges,
     expenses, and liabilities accrued since the last Valuation Date which
     are proper under the provisions of the Plan and the Trust and which in
     the discretion of the Trustee are properly chargeable against income
     for the period.

     C.   Notwithstanding Subsection B hereof, in the event that an
Investment Manager is designated by the Primary Sponsor and if the Investment
Manager either directs the investment of or itself invests any assets of the
Fund, or in the event that an Investment Committee is appointed by the
Primary Sponsor and directs the investment of any assets of the Fund, and if
any of such assets are non-listed securities or are not publicly traded or
if the fair market value of any of such assets cannot be readily determined,
then the Investment Manager or the Investment Committee, whichever is
applicable, shall determine the net income or net loss and the fair market
value of such assets and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon such
determination.

     D.   In the event that an Investment Manager is designated by the Plan
Sponsor and if the Trustee gives the Investment Manager possession of any
portion of the assets of the Fund, then the Investment Manager shall
determine the net income or net loss and the fair market value of those
assets and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon the determination.


                          SECTION 12
                     TRUSTEE COMPENSATION

     A.   The Trustee's compensation shall be the amount agreed upon in a
separate written agreement between the Primary Sponsor and the Trustee.  If
the Primary Sponsor fails to pay to the Trustee its compensation and expenses
within thirty (30) days after the Trustee presents its invoice to the Primary
Sponsor, the Trustee is authorized to use the assets held by it under the
Trust to pay its unpaid compensation and expenses.  No person who serves as
the Trustee and who receives full-time pay from a Plan Sponsor shall be
entitled to receive any compensation from the Fund, except for the
reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred by him in his role
as Trustee.

     B.   All taxes of whatever kind or nature that may be levied or
assessed under existing or future laws upon, or in respect of, the Plan, the
Trust, the Fund or the income or gains thereof or therefrom shall be paid
from the Fund.


                          SECTION 13
                    TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITY

     The Trustee is not responsible for the application, investment or other
disposition of any funds or property held or managed by, or otherwise subject
to direction by, any person other than the Trustee.  The Trustee is not
responsible for the application of any funds or property held by it under the
Trust which have been paid to the Plan Administrator or which have been paid
pursuant to the Plan and Trust or as directed by the Plan Administrator.  The
Trustee has no responsibility with respect to any administration of the Plan
or the payment of any benefits under the Plan.


                          SECTION 14
                         RECORDKEEPING

     The Trustee shall keep accurate and detailed accounts of all
investments, receipts, disbursements and other transactions pursuant to the
Plan and the Trust, and all books and records relating thereto shall be open
to inspection and audit at all reasonable times by the Plan Administrator. 
Within ninety (90) days following the later of the close of each Plan year
or the receipt of a Plan Sponsor's contribution, and within ninety (90) days
after a Report Date (which for purposes of this Trust shall mean the date of
the death, removal or resignation of any Trustee from time to time serving
hereunder, or the date of the termination of the Trust) the Trustee shall
file with the Plan Administrator its written account.  The account shall set
forth (i) all investments, receipts, disbursements and other transactions
effected by it during such Plan Year or during the period from the last
Valuation Date to the Report Date and (ii) the determination of the Trustee
of the net income or net loss of the Fund for such Plan Year or during the
period from the last Valuation Date to the Report Date and the determination
of the Trustee of the fair market value of the assets of the Fund as at the
Valuation Date or as at the Report Date, as the case may be.  Unless a Report
Date is also a Valuation Date, no allocation of earnings, gains or losses
shall be made to a Member's Account.


                          SECTION 15
              REMOVAL OR RESIGNATION OF TRUSTEE,
             AND AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF TRUST

     A.   The Trustee, or an individual Trustee, as applicable, may be
removed by the Primary Sponsor at any time upon thirty (30) days' notice in
writing to the Trustee and the Plan Administrator.  Any Trustee serving
hereunder may resign at any time without leave of court, upon thirty (30)
days' notice in writing to the Plan Sponsor and the Plan Administrator.

     B.   Upon the death, removal or resignation of a Trustee, the Primary
Sponsor shall appoint a successor Trustee as soon as possible. If the former
Trustee was one of several Trustees, the remaining persons constituting the
Trustee may continue to act as Trustee until the Primary Sponsor appoints a
successor co-Trustee.

     C.   Any removal of a Trustee or appointment of a successor Trustee
shall be without leave of court by notice in writing signed by the Primary
Sponsor and delivered to the Trustee being removed or appointed, with a copy
to the Plan Administrator.  Any successor Trustee serving at any time
hereunder shall serve with the same powers and duties as the Trustee named
herein.

     D.   Upon receipt by the Trustee (or by the Primary Sponsor in the
event of the death of a last remaining individual Trustee) of the designated
successor's acceptance of its appointment as successor Trustee hereunder, the
funds and properties then constituting the Fund shall be transferred to the
successor Trustee.  However, the Trustee is not required to transfer funds
and properties to a successor trustee unless the Trustee is discharged from
all liability for any taxes which may be due and owing by the Plan and Trust,
or unless either (1) the successor trustee, who must be acceptable to the
Trustee, indemnifies the Trustee against any such liability or (2) each Plan
Sponsor so indemnifies the Trustee in a manner acceptable to the Trustee.

     E.   If the Primary Sponsor fails to appoint a successor trustee
before the expiration of the thirty (30) day notice period, or no written
acceptance is received from a successor Trustee, then at any time after the
end of the thirty (30) day notice period the Trustee may file an appropriate
action in a court of competent jurisdiction and assign to the custody of the
court the funds and properties then held by the Trustee constituting the
Fund.  

     F.   Upon the transfer of the Fund to a successor trustee or to a
court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be, the Trustee shall be
relieved of all further responsibilities in connection with the Plan, the
Trust or the Fund.  The Trustee is authorized, however, to reserve therefrom
such money or property as it may deem advisable for payment of its fees and
expenses in connection with the settlement of its account or otherwise, and
any balance of the reserve remaining after the payment of such fees and
expenses shall be paid over to the successor trustee or to the court.

     G.   The Primary Sponsor reserves the right to amend this Trust
Agreement by written notice to the Trustee.  However, no amendment which
affects the rights, duties or responsibilities of the Trustee may be made
without the Trustee's consent.

     H.   The Trust shall continue for such time as may be necessary to
accomplish the purposes for which it was created and shall terminate only
upon the complete distribution of the Fund.  The Trust may be terminated as
of any date by the Primary Sponsor by written notice to the Trustee and the
Plan Administrator given in the manner prescribed in the Plan which specifies
the date as of which the Trust shall terminate.  Upon termination of the
Trust, if the Trustee has not received instructions to the contrary from the
Primary Sponsor, the Trustee shall liquidate the Fund and, after paying the
reasonable expenses of the Trust, including expenses involved in the
termination, distribute the balance thereof according to the written
directions of the Plan Administrator.  The Trustee is not required to make
any distribution until it receives a copy of an Internal Revenue Service
determination letter to the effect that the termination does not affect
either the qualified status of the Plan or the exempt status of the Trust,
or, if such letter is not issued, until the Trustee is reasonably satisfied
that adequate provision has been made for the payment of all taxes which may
be due and owing by the Trust.  In no event shall any distribution be made
by the Trustee until the Trustee is reasonably satisfied that the
distribution will not be contrary to the applicable provisions of the Plan
dealing with terminations of the Plan and the Trust.

     I.   The Trust and the contributions made by each Plan Sponsor to the
Trustee are conditioned upon the conditions set forth in the Plan as to
qualification and returns of contributions, and the returns of contributions
by the Trustee to the Plan Sponsors in certain events is governed by such
provisions of the Plan.

     J.   If at any time more than one person or entity is serving as the
Trustee, the persons or entities so serving shall act by the action of a
majority, with or without a meeting, and any action may be evidenced by a
writing executed by a majority of the persons or entities constituting the
Trustee.

     K.   Each Plan Sponsor agrees at its sole cost and expense to
indemnify and hold harmless the Trust and the Trustee from and against any
claim, liability, loss, cost, expense, action or cause of action resulting
from or in connection with any claim asserted by any person or persons where
the Trustee has acted in good faith pursuant to the Trust or in reliance on
a written notice to the extent the notice is authorized in the Plan or Trust
and has been given in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

     L.   The Trust shall be administered, construed and enforced according
to the laws of the State of Alabama to the extent not preempted by federal
laws, and the Trustee shall be liable to account only in the courts of that
state and in any court of appropriate jurisdiction of the United States of
America.  All transfers of funds or other property to or from the Trustee
shall be deemed to take place in the State of Alabama.

                                 Between

                     TIAS, INC., a Texas corporation
                                   and

                       MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC., 
                         a Delaware corporation

         Agree as follows as of the 19th day of November, 1993: 
                                    
                                    
                          ARTICLE 1  The Loans.

      Section 1.1      The Loans.  The Lender agrees, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, to lend to the Borrower, prior
to the Maturity Date, amounts which in the aggregate principal amount do not
exceed the Applicable Commitment.

      Section 1.2      Over-advances.  If at any time the Loans exceed the
Applicable Commitment, or any other applicable limitation set forth in this
Agreement, such Loans shall nevertheless constitute Obligations that are
secured by the Collateral and are entitled to all benefits thereof.  In the
event that the Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall make any
Loans which give rise to an Over-advance, Loans in an aggregate principal
amount equal to such Over-advance shall be payable on demand.

      Section 1.3      Interest.  The Borrower shall pay interest on the
outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans until the Loans shall be due
(whether at maturity, by reason of acceleration or otherwise) as provided in
the Note.

      Section 1.4      Repayment and Prepayment.  Subject to mandatory
repayment events set forth herein, the principal amount of the Loans shall
be repaid as provided in the Note.  Loans may be repaid prior to the Maturity
Date at any time without penalty.

      Section 1.5      Note and Loan Account.  

            (a)  The Loans shall be evidenced by the Note.  The Note shall
      be issued by the Borrower to the Lender and shall be duly executed and
      delivered by one of the Authorized Signatories.

            (b)  The Lender shall open and maintain on its books in the name
      of the Borrower a loan account with respect to the Loans and interest
      thereon.  The Lender shall debit such loan account for accrued interest
      on the Loans, and shall credit such loan account for each payment on
      account of principal of or interest on the Loans.

      Section 1.6      Manner of Payment.

            (a)  Each payment (including any prepayment) by the Borrower on
      account of the principal of or interest on the Loans and any other
      amount owed to the Lender under this Agreement or the Note shall be
      made not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the date specified for
      payment under this Agreement to the Lender in lawful money of the
      United States of America in immediately available funds.

            (b)  If any payment under this Agreement or the Note shall be
      specified to be made upon a day which is not a Business Day, it shall
      be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and such
      extension of time shall in such case be included in computing interest
      and fees, if any, in connection with such payment. 

            (c)  The Borrower agrees to pay principal, interest, fees, and
      all other amounts due hereunder or under the Note without set-off or
      counterclaim or any deduction whatsoever. 

            (d)  Prior to the acceleration of the Loans under Section 7.2
      hereof, if some but less than all amounts due from the Borrower are
      received by the Lender, the Lender shall apply such amounts to the
      Obligations in the following order of priority:  (i) to the costs and
      expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses), if any, incurred by
      the Lender in the collection of such amounts under this Agreement or
      any of the other Loan Documents; (ii) to the payment of interest then
      due and payable on the Loans; (iii) to the payment of all other amounts
      not otherwise referred to in this Section 1.6 then due and payable
      hereunder or under the other Loan Documents; and (iv) to the payment
      of principal then due and payable on the Obligations in such order as
      the Lender shall determine.  Subsequent to the acceleration of the
      Obligations under Section 7.2 hereof, all amounts received from any
      source whatsoever by the Lender with respect to the Borrower shall be
      applied by the Lender to the Obligations in such manner as the Lender
      in its sole discretion elects.


                    ARTICLE 2  Conditions Precedent.

      Section 2.1      Conditions Precedent to Closing.  The obligation of

      corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
      under the laws of the state of Texas, has the power and authority, to

      as now being and hereafter proposed to be conducted, and is duly
      qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, and
      authorized to do business, in each jurisdiction in which the character

      corporate power and has taken all necessary corporate action to
      authorize it to execute, deliver, and perform this Agreement and each

      the terms and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
      thereby.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
      Borrower, and is, and each of the other Loan Documents to which
      Borrower is a party is, a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the
      Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except that
      enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws
      affecting creditors' rights generally, and except that the availability
      of certain remedies may be limited by the effect of general principles
      of equity, whether applied by a court of law or equity.

            (c)  Subsidiaries.  The Borrower has no Subsidiaries other than
      Tias Beverage Company, a Texas corporation, forty percent (40%) of the

            (d)  Capital Stock and Related Matters.  The authorized capital
      stock of the Borrower consists of Nine Million Six Hundred Thousand Six
      Hundred (9,600,600) shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,

      shares are currently issued and outstanding as of the Agreement Date
      and are fully paid and non-assessable and Five Million Six Hundred
      Thousand and Six Hundred (5,600,600) shares of Series A Preferred

      outstanding shares are owned or held of record as of the Agreement Date
      as shown on Schedule 1 attached hereto, and are not subject to any
      Liens or other rights except as set forth on Schedule 1.  As of the
      Agreement Date, except for the option granted to the Lender pursuant
      to the Company Option Agreement and the Shareholder Option Agreement,
      there are no options, warrants, purchase agreements, put agreements,
      call agreements or any other agreements to which the Borrower is a
      party which relate to or affect, the purchase or sale of the capital
      stock of the Borrower, except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 2
      hereto.

            (e)  Compliance with Laws, Other Loan Documents, and
      Contemplated Transactions.  The execution, delivery, and performance
      of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents in accordance
      with their respective terms and the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i) violate any
      Applicable Law, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of, or
      constitute a default under the articles of incorporation or by-laws of
      the Borrower or under any indenture, agreement, or other instrument to
      which the Borrower or any Shareholder is a party or by which they or
      any of their respective properties may be bound, or (iii) result in or
      require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to
      any property now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or any
      Shareholder except Permitted Liens. 

            (f)  Necessary Authorizations.  The Borrower and each
      Shareholder have secured all Necessary Authorizations, and all such
      Necessary Authorizations are in full force and effect and not subject
      to any pending attack or revocation.

            (g)  Title to Properties.  The Borrower has good, marketable,
      and legal title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of its
      material properties and assets, and none of such properties or assets
      is subject to any Liens other than Permitted Liens.  Schedule 3
      attached hereto sets forth each lease or rental agreement to which the
      Borrower is a party as of the Agreement Date, identifying the title of
      such documents, the parties thereto, the property to which such
      document relates, the date of execution and referring to each material
      amendment or waiver thereto.

            (h)  Taxes.  All federal, state, and other tax returns of the
      Borrower required by law to be filed have been duly filed, and all
      federal, state, and other taxes, assessments, and other governmental
      charges or levies upon the Borrower and any of its properties, income,
      profits, and assets, which are due and payable, have been paid, except
      any such the payment of which the Borrower is contesting in good faith
      by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been
      provided on the books of the Borrower to the extent required by GAAP.

            (i)  Financial Statements.  As of the Agreement Date, the
      Borrower has furnished, or caused to be furnished, to the Lender
      financial statements for the Borrower which present fairly in all
      material respects in accordance with GAAP, except for notes and
      disclosures and year-end adjustments, the financial position of the
      Borrower as at September 30, 1993, and the results of operations for
      the period then ended.

            (j)  No Adverse Change.  Since September 30, 1993, there has
      occurred no event which would have a Materially Adverse Effect.

            (k)  Liabilities, Litigation, etc.  Except for liabilities
      incurred in the normal course of business, the Borrower has no material
      (individually or in the aggregate) liabilities, direct or contingent,
      nor any litigation, to the knowledge of Borrower (pending or
      threatened) as of the Agreement Date except as disclosed or referred
      to in the financial statements referred to in Section 3.1(i) above or
      Schedule 4 hereto.

            (l)  ERISA.  The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate and each of
      their respective Plans are in material compliance with ERISA and the
      Code, and neither the Borrower nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
      incurred any accumulated funding deficiency with respect to any such
      Plan within the meaning of ERISA or the Code.  Except as may be
      otherwise disclosed in a signed letter by the Borrower to the Lender
      dated as of the Agreement Date, the Borrower and each of its ERISA
      Affiliates have complied in all material respects with all requirements
      of ERISA Sections 601 through 608 and Code Section 4980B.  Neither the
      Borrower nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has made any promises of
      retirement or other benefits to employees, except as set forth in the
      Plans.  The Borrower has not incurred any material liability to the
      Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in connection with any such Plan. 
      The assets of each such Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA are
      sufficient to provide the benefits under such Plan, the payment of
      which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would guarantee if such
      Plan were terminated, and such assets are also sufficient to provide
      all other "benefit liabilities" (as defined in ERISA Section
      4001(a)(16), due under the Plan upon termination.  No Reportable Event
      has occurred and is continuing with respect to any such Plan.  No such
      Plan or trust created thereunder, or party in interest (as defined in
      Section 3(14) of ERISA), or any fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21)
      of ERISA), has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
      defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) which
      would subject such Plan or any other Plan of the Borrower or any of its
      ERISA Affiliates, any trust created thereunder, or any such party in
      interest or fiduciary, or any party dealing with any such Plan or any
      such trust to the penalty or tax on "prohibited transactions" imposed
      by Section 502 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.  Neither the
      Borrower nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is a participant in or is
      obligated to make any payment to a Multiemployer Plan.

            (m)  Compliance with Regulations G, T, U, and X.  The Borrower
      is not engaged principally or as one of its important activities in the
      business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying,
      and the Borrower does not own or presently intend to acquire, any
      "margin security" or "margin stock" as defined in Regulations G, T, U,
      and X (12 C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224) of the Board of Governors of the
      Federal Reserve System (herein called "margin stock").  None of the
      proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for the
      purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the purpose
      of reducing or retiring any Indebtedness which was originally incurred
      to purchase or carry margin stock or for any other purpose which might
      constitute this transaction a "purpose credit" within the meaning of
      said Regulations G, T, U, and X.

            (n)  Solvency.  The Borrower is Solvent.

            (o)  Name and Location of Chief Executive Office of Borrower. 
      The Borrower has not changed its name within the preceding five (5)

      any other name or trade name except as set forth on Schedule 5 hereto. 
      As of the Agreement Date, the Borrower's chief executive office and
      Federal employer identification number are set forth in the Security
      Agreement.

            (p)  Environmental Matters.  Except as would not, individually
      or in the aggregate, have a Materially Adverse Effect, and except as
      is described on Schedule 6 attached hereto with respect to each of the
      Properties:

                 (i)   The Properties do not contain, in, on or under,
            including, without limitation, the soil and groundwater
            thereunder, any Hazardous Materials in violation of
            Environmental Laws or in amounts that have given or are
            reasonably expected to give rise to liability under
            Environmental Laws.

                (ii)   The Properties and all operations and facilities at
            the Properties are in compliance in all material respects with
            all Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination or
            violation of any Environmental Law which has given or reasonably
            is expected to interfere with the continued operation of any of
            the Properties or impair the financial condition of the
            Borrower.

               (iii)   The Borrower has not received from any governmental
            authority any complaint, notice of violation, alleged violation,
            investigation or advisory action or notice of potential
            liability regarding matters of environmental protection or
            permit compliance under applicable Environmental Laws with
            regard to the Properties, nor is the Borrower aware that any
            governmental authority is contemplating delivering to the
            Borrower any such notice.  To the knowledge of Borrower, there
            has been no pending or threatened complaint, notice of
            violation, alleged violation, investigation or notice of
            potential liability under Environmental Laws with regard to any
            of the Properties.

                (iv)   Hazardous Materials have not been generated,
            treated, stored, disposed of, at, on or under any of the
            Properties by the Borrower in violation of any Environmental
            Laws or in a manner that has given or could reasonably be
            expected to give rise to liability under Environmental Laws nor
            have any Hazardous Materials been transported or disposed of
            from any of the Properties by the Borrower to any other location
            in violation of any Environmental Laws or in a manner that has
            given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to liability
            under Environmental Laws.

                 (v)   There are no governmental administrative actions or
            judicial proceedings pending under any Environmental Law to
            which the Borrower is a party with respect to any of the
            Properties obligating the Borrower, nor are there any consent
            decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders
            or other orders, or other administrative or judicial
            requirements obligating the Borrower outstanding under any
            Environmental Law with respect to any of the Properties.

                (vi)   There has been no release or threat of release by
            the Borrower of Hazardous Materials into the environment at or
            from any of the Properties, or arising from or relating to the
            operations of the Borrower, in violation of Environmental Laws
            or in amounts that has given or could reasonably be expected to
            give rise to liability under Environmental Laws.

            (q)  OSHA.  All of the Borrower's operations are conducted in
      substantial compliance with all applicable rules and regulations
      promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the
      United States Department of Labor.

                (ii)   The Borrower will not permit any of the Equipment to
            become affixed to any real property leased to the Borrower so
            that an interest arises therein under the real estate laws of
            the applicable jurisdiction unless the landlord of such real
            property has executed a landlord waiver or leasehold mortgage in
            favor of the Lender, and the Borrower will not permit any of the
            Equipment to become an accession to any personal property other
            than Equipment subject to first priority Liens in favor of the
            Lender or Permitted Liens.

           renewed, and extended to be in accordance with the terms of the
           Renewal Note.  The Renewal Note amends, restates, and supersedes
           in its entirety the Original Note.

      (b)  The modification, renewal, and extension of the Existing
           Indebtedness do not constitute the cancellation or extinguishment
           of any of the Existing Indebtedness or any of the liens or
           security interests now securing the payment of the Existing
           Indebtedness.

      (c)  Upon the substitution of the Renewal Note for the Original Note,

      (g)  Sections 4.H, 5.A, 5.F, 6.G, and 6.H of the Loan Agreement are
           hereby terminated and of no further force and effect, and the

                                Exhibit A

                             PROMISSORY NOTE

$999,997.10                                           November 19, 1993


      FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Tias, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Maker"), hereby
promises to pay to the order of Larry D. Lavine ("Payee"), at 4600 Greenville
Avenue, Suite 160, Dallas, Dallas County, Texas 75206, the principal amount
of Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Seven and 10/100
Dollars ($999,997.10), together with interest, as hereinafter described.

      This Note is a modification, extension, and renewal of the outstanding
principal amount of the indebtedness of Maker to Payee (the "Existing
Indebtedness") evidenced by a Promissory Note of Maker in favor of Payee
dated September 20, 1991, in the original principal amount of Nine Hundred
Ninety-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Seven and 10/100 Dollars
($999,997.10) (the "Original Note"), that was executed and delivered pursuant
to a Loan Agreement between Maker and Payee dated as of September 20, 1991
(as now existing, and as may hereafter be amended, the "Loan Agreement"). 
Maker hereby affirms that the Existing Indebtedness is outstanding and that
it shall continue to be outstanding as modified, extended, and renewed in
accordance with the terms of this Note and the Loan Agreement (including the
amendments thereto set forth in a letter agreement dated November 19, 1993,
between Maker and Payee).  This Note does not cancel or extinguish any of the
existing Indebtedness, but amends, restates and supersedes in its entirety
the Original Note evidencing the Existing Indebtedness.

      The unpaid principal amount of this Note shall bear simple interest at
a rate per annum of nine and three-quarters percent (9-3/4%), calculated on
a basis of actual days elapsed and computed in accordance with the number of
days in each calendar year.  Accrued interest on the unpaid principal amounts
of this Note shall be due and payable in monthly installments commencing on
December 31, 1993, and continuing on the last day of each month thereafter
until May 31, 1999, when all amounts under this Note shall be due and
payable.  At each interest payment date and at maturity (stated or by
acceleration), the interest then payable shall be calculated from the date
thereof on the principal amount hereof from day to day unpaid at the interest
rate set forth above in this paragraph; provided, that (a) any interest
previously paid shall be deducted from the interest then payable, and (b) the
total interest payable through such date shall not exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate (as defined below) over the then elapsed term hereof.  All of the
principal amount of this Note is due and payable on May 31, 1999.  All of the
unpaid principal amount of this Note, together with all interest accrued
thereon, shall also be due and payable upon the sale of all or substantially
all of the capital stock of Maker, including (without limitation) any
consolidation or merger of Maker with and into any other entity.

      Maker may prepay all or any part of the principal or accrued interest
at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty.  All partial
prepayments shall be applied first to accrued and unpaid interest and then
to principal.

      The holder hereof may declare the entire unpaid principal of and
accrued interest on this Note immediately due and payable, without notice,
demand, or presentment, all of which are hereby waived, foreclose any liens
or security interests securing all or any part hereof, offset against this
Note any sum or sums owed by the holder hereof to Maker, or exercise any
other right or remedy to which the holder hereby may be entitled by agreement
at law, or in equity, upon a Default, as defined in the Loan Agreement.  Each
right and remedy available to the holder hereof shall be cumulative of and
in addition to each other such right and remedy.  No delay on the part of the
holder hereof in the exercise of any right or remedy available to the holder
hereof shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude other or further exercise thereof or exercise of
any other such right or remedy.  At the option of the holder hereof, all
past-due principal and accrued interest shall, from maturity (stated or by
acceleration) until paid, bear simple interest at a rate per annum equal to
thirteen percent (13%).

      If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or
if it is collected through any legal proceedings, Maker agrees to pay court
costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and other costs of collection of the
holder hereof.

      Regardless of any provision contained herein, the holder hereof shall
never be entitled to receive, collect, or apply, as interest on this Note,
any amount in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and, in the event the holder
hereof ever receives, collects, or applies as interest, any such excess, such
amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed a partial prepayment
of principal and treated hereunder as such; and, if the principal hereof is
paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to Maker.  In
determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific
contingency, exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, Maker and the holder hereof
shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (a) treat all
advances hereunder as but a single extension of credit, (b) characterize any
nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest,
(c) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (d) "spread"
the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term hereof;
provided, that if the principal hereof is paid in full prior to the end of
the full contemplated term hereof, and if the interest received for the
actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the
holder hereof shall refund to Maker the amount of such excess, and, in such
event, the holder hereof shall not be subject to any penalties provided by
any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving, or receiving
interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  As used herein, the term the
"Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum rate of interest (or, if the context
so requires, an amount calculated at such rate) which the holder hereof is
allowed to contract for, charge, take, reserve, or receive under applicable
law after taking into account, to the extent required by applicable law, any
and all relevant payments or charges made in connection with this Note.  To
the extent the laws of the State of Texas are applicable for purposes of
determining the Highest Lawful Rate, such term shall mean the "indicated rate
ceiling" from time to time in effect under Article 1.04, Title 79, Revised
Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, or, if permitted by applicable law
and effective upon the giving of the notices required by such Article 1.04
(or effective upon any other date otherwise specified by applicable law), the
"monthly ceiling," the "quarterly ceiling," or the "annualized ceiling" from
time to time in effect under such Article 1.04, whichever the holder hereof
shall elect to substitute for the "indicated rate ceiling," and vice versa,
each such substitution to have the effect provided in such Article 1.04; and
the holder hereof shall be entitled to make such election from time to time
and one or more times and, without notice to Maker, to leave any such
substitute rate in effect for subsequent periods in accordance with
subsection (h)(1)g of such Article 1.04.  Pursuant to Article 15.10(b) of
Chapter 15, Title 79, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended,
Maker and the holder hereof expressly agree that such Chapter 15 shall not
govern or in any manner apply to this Note or to the indebtedness covered
hereby.

      Maker and each surety, endorser, guarantor, and other party ever liable
for payment of any part hereof jointly and severally waive presentment and
demand for payment, protest, notice of intention to accelerate, and notice
of protest and nonpayment, and agree that their liability on this Note shall
not be affected by, and hereby consent to, any renewal or extension in the
time of payment hereof, any indulgences, or any release or change in any
security for the payment of this Note.

      THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS NOTE SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

Tias, Inc.
4600 Greenville Avenue

Gentlemen:

      The undersigned holder (the "Holder") of the Existing Indebtedness, as
described and defined in Paragraph 1 of the Promissory Note that is Exhibit
A hereto (the "Renewal Note"), of Tias, Inc., a Texas corporation (the
"Company"), hereby agrees with the Company as follows:

      (a)   The Existing Indebtedness and all of its terms are hereby
            modified, renewed, and extended to be in accordance with the
            terms of the Renewal Note.

      (b)   The Renewal Note, with the Security Documents, as described and
            defined in Paragraph 6 of the Renewal Note, are all of the
            agreements between the Company and the Holder relating to the
            Existing Indebtedness as modified, renewed, and extended.

      (c)   The documents referred to in the preceding clause (b) of this
            letter agreement amend and restate in their entirety, and
            supersede, all prior instruments and other documents evidencing
            or governing the Existing Indebtedness as modified, renewed, and
            extended.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that the conversion rights
            and subordination provisions of the prior instruments and other
            documents evidencing or governing the Existing Indebtedness are
            hereby terminated and of no further force and effect.

      (d)   The modification, renewal, and extension of the terms of the
            Existing Indebtedness and all of its terms do not constitute the
            cancellation or extinguishment of any of the Existing
            Indebtedness or any of the liens or security interests now
            securing the payment of the Existing Indebtedness; provided,
            however, that the Holder hereby acknowledges that the Assignment
            of Accounts by the Company in favor of the Holder and the
            Assignment of Accounts by Larry Lavine in favor of the Holder,
            both dated as of August 1, 1991, have previously been
            terminated.

      (e)   The references to the Loan and to the Debenture in the Security
            Agreement, as described and defined in Paragraph 6 of the
            Renewal Note, are hereby amended to be references to the
            indebtedness evidenced by the Renewal Note and to the Renewal
            Note, respectively.

      (f)   In light of the termination of the subordination provisions
            included in the prior instruments and other documents evidencing
            or governing the Existing Indebtedness, Section H of the
            Security Agreement is hereby deleted and of no further force and
            effect, and all references to the Senior Lender and the Senior
            Loan Documents in the Security Agreement are hereby deleted and
            of no further force and effect.  Nevertheless, the Holder hereby
            acknowledges and agrees that the Existing Indebtedness and the
            Holder's rights and remedies under the Renewal Note and the
            Security Documents shall be subject to the terms of the
            Intercreditor Agreement dated as of this date among the Company,
            the Holder, Morrison Restaurants Inc. ("MRI"), and Larry Lavine,
            which is being executed and delivered in connection with the
            Loan Agreement dated as of this date between the Company and MRI
            (the "MRI Loan Agreement").

      (g)  All references to Previous Security Interests in Section E.2 of the
           Security Agreement are hereby amended to be references to Permitted
           Liens as defined in the MRI Loan Agreement.

      (h)  The Company shall have no further obligations to the undersigned
           under the Purchase Agreement, as described and defined in Paragraph
           4(b) of the Renewal Note, except for the registration rights granted
           to the undersigned by the Company in Section 9.03 of the Purchase
           Agreement with respect to the Common Stock (as defined in the
           Purchase Agreement) purchased by the undersigned pursuant to the
           Purchase Agreement, but not with respect to the Conversion Shares or
           the Conversion Common Shares (both as defined in the Purchase
           Agreement), which have no further applicability because the Holder
           has no further conversion rights with respect to any of the Existing
           Indebtedness.

      (i)  The references in the Security Agreement to events of default set
           forth in the Purchase Agreement are hereby modified to be references
           to the Events of Default set forth in Paragraph 4 of the Renewal
           Note.

      (j)  The Holder hereby (1) consents to the MRI Loan Agreement and the
           Company's consummation of the various transactions, and performance
           of its various obligations, contemplated by the MRI Loan Agreement
           and (2) waives any Event of Default under the terms of the Renewal
           Note and the Security Agreement which may exist or arise as the
           result of the foregoing.

      All references to the Holder in this letter agreement shall be deemed to
include its successors and assigns, and all covenants and agreements contained
herein by the Holder shall be binding upon its successors and assigns.

      This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the State of Texas.  

      Renewal Note shall be modified to reflect the average interest rate
currently earned on all Existing Indebtedness.

future statute, law or regulation, such proceeding shall not have been 
dismissed;
or, within ninety (90) days after the appointment without the consent or
acquiescence of the Company of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of the 
Company or of all or any substantial part of the properties of the Company, 
such appointment shall not have been vacated;

then, and in any such event, the holder hereof may at any time at its option, by
written notice or notices to the Company, declare the entire unpaid principal
amount of and accrued interest on this Note to be due and payable, whereupon the
same shall forthwith mature and become due and payable without presentment,
demand, protest or notice, notice of intention to accelerate or notice of
acceleration, all of which are hereby waived.

      5.   Remedies on Default, etc.  The holder hereof, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, may proceed to protect and 
enforce its rights by a suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate 
proceeding, including (but not limited to) the enforcement 
of any rights under any of the Security Agreements (as hereinafter defined), 
whether for the collection of amounts due under this Note (by acceleration 
or otherwise), for the specific performance of any agreement contained 
herein, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms or 
provisions hereof or thereof or in aid of the exercise of any power granted 
hereby or thereby or by law.  No course of dealing and no delay on 
the part of any holder of this Note in exercising any right shall operate 
as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights.  No
remedy conferred hereby upon any holder of this Note shall be exclusive of any
other remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law,
in equity, by statute or otherwise.  Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, if this Note is placed in the hands of an

Company agrees to pay, in addition to all amounts then due hereunder, all 
expenses of collection, including (without limitation) reasonable attorneys' 
fees.

      6.   Collateral.  The full and complete payment of any and all amounts due
under the terms of this Note shall be entitled to all of the benefits of the
security interests in certain properties made and granted by all documents
executed or used to create or evidence the liens and security interests in the
property securing the payment of the Existing Indebtedness, consisting (as of 
this date) of the Security Agreement between the Company and Crosspoint dated

agreement between the Company and Crosspoint dated as of November 19, 1993, and 
the financing statement by the Company and Crosspoint filed with the Secretary 
of State of Texas on April 27, 1992 (collectively with the Security Agreement 
(as now amended), the "Security Documents").

      7.   Waivers of Demand, etc.  The Company hereby waives presentment and
demand for payment, protest and notice of protest, nonpayment, acceleration and
intention to accelerate and agrees that liability hereunder or under any 
guaranty of payment hereof shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in 
time of payment hereof.

      8.   Usury Savings.  It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply
with the usury laws of the State of Texas.  Accordingly, it is agreed that,
notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Note or in any of the
documents securing payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto, in no event 
shall this Note or such documents require the payment or permit the collection 
of interest in excess of the maximum amount permitted by such laws.  If any such
excess of interest is contracted for, charged, or received under this Note or
under the terms of any of the documents securing payment hereof or otherwise
relating hereto, or in the event the maturity of the indebtedness evidenced by
this Note is accelerated in whole or in part, or in the event that all or part 
of the principal or interest of this Note shall be prepaid, so that under any of
of such circumstances the amount of interest contracted for, charged, or 
received under this Note or under any of the documents securing payment hereof 
or otherwise relating hereto, on the amount of principal actually outstanding 
from time to time under this Note shall exceed the maximum amount of interest 
permitted by the usury laws of the State of Texas, then in any such event 
(a) the provisions of this Paragraph 8 shall govern and control, (b) 
neither the Company nor any other person or entity now or hereafter 
liable for the payment hereof shall be obligated to pay the amount of 
such interest to the extent that it is in excess of the maximum amount 
of interest permitted by the usury laws of the State of Texas, (c) any such
excess which may have been collected shall be either applied as a credit against
the then unpaid principal amount hereof or refunded to the Company, at the
holder's option, and (d) the effective rate of interest shall be automatically
reduced to the maximum lawful rate of interest allowed under the usury laws of 
the State of Texas as now or hereafter construed by the courts having 
jurisdiction thereof.  It is further agreed that, without limitation of the 
foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged, 
or received under this Note or under such other documents which are 
made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the maximum 
lawful rate of interest shall be made, to the extent permitted by the laws 
of the State of Texas, by amortizing, prorating, allocating, and spreading in 
equal parts during the period of the full stated term of the indebtedness 
evidenced hereby all interest at any time contracted for, charged, or received 
from the Company or otherwise by the holder or holders hereof in connection 
with such indebtedness.

any of the provisions, covenants, and conditions set forth in this Note may be
waived, or any of such provisions, covenants, or conditions may be modified or
amended, only upon the prior written consent of Crosspoint or the other holder 
of this Note.

      10   Modification of References.  All references to the Loan and to the
Debenture in the Security Agreements are hereby modified or amended to be
references to the indebtedness evidenced by this Note and to this Note,
respectively.  Further, the references in the Security Agreements to events of
default set forth in the Purchase Agreement are hereby modified to be references
to the Events of Default set forth in Paragraph 4 of this Note.

      11.  Successors and Assigns.  All references to the Company herein shall,
and shall be deemed to, include its successors and assigns, and all covenants,
stipulations, promises, and agreements contained herein by or on behalf of the
Company shall be binding upon its successors and assigns, whether so expressed 
or not.

                      FIRST AMENDMENT TO
          MORRISON INCORPORATED 1987 STOCK BONUS AND
                NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION PLAN


     THIS AMENDMENT is made the 25th day of September, 1990, by MORRISON
INCORPORATED, a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the
State of Delaware (the "Company");

                     W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Company has previously adopted the Morrison Incorporated
1987 Stock Bonus and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, effective November 30,
1986 (the "Plan"); and

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan to clarify the procedure
for determining the price of the shares of Company stock subject to options
issued under the Plan and for other reasons;

     NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended, effective as of September
25, 1990, as follows:

                              1.

     Section 2 of the Plan shall be amended by deleting Subsection (a) in its
entirety and by substituting therefor the following:

               "(a) to determine which eligible employees
          described in Section 3 below (the "Eligible
          Employees") may purchase shares of Company common
          stock, $.01 par value (the "Shares"), from the
          Company and the maximum value of Shares each Eligible
          Employee may purchase."

                              2.

     Section 2 of the Plan also shall be amended by deleting from Subsection
(b) thereof the phrase "with a portion of their cash bonuses."

                              3.

     Section 5 of the Plan shall be amended by deleting the phrase "with Cash
Bonuses" from the heading and by deleting the first paragraph thereof and by
substituting therefor the following:

               "Each year the Committee shall decide which
          employees who are awarded cash bonuses by the Company
          will be Eligible Employees.  Each Eligible Employee
          will receive notification of his eligibility on a
          form substantially similar to the form attached
          hereto as Exhibit B.  The notification also will
          inform the Eligible Employee of the maximum value of
          Shares he may purchase from the Company at their fair
          market value on the date designated in the
          notification.  Shares may be purchased at any time
          within thirty (30) days commencing with the date
          designated by the Committee (the "Offer Period").  No
          later than the expiration day of the Offer Period,
          each Eligible Employee who desires to purchase Shares
          shall notify the Company by filing an irrevocable
          election with the Company on a form substantially
          similar to the form also contained in Exhibit B
          specifying the value of Shares he desires to purchase
          and the manner of payment.  For all purposes under
          the Plan, the date of purchase of the Shares shall be
          the day the election form is delivered to the
          Company.  Payment for the Shares shall be made no
          later than the day on which the Offer Period expires
          and may be made in cash or, if the Eligible Employee
          is not a person required by Section 16(a) of the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file reports with
          respect to the common stock of the Company, with
          shares of previously owned common stock of the
          Company, or any combination thereof.  The Company
          will not be obligated to sell fractional Shares but
          may round the number of Shares to be purchased down
          to the next whole number."

                              4.

     Section 5 of the Plan also shall be amended by deleting the last
paragraph and by substituting therefor the following:

               "The Shares may not be sold, transferred,
          conveyed or pledged by the Eligible Employee for
          three (3) years after the date on which they were
          purchased and issued to him, except to the extent
          that these restrictions on transfers are waived by
          the Committee.  A legend to this effect shall be
          placed on the Share certificates.  An Eligible
          Employee may, subsequent to the purchase and issuance
          of the Shares, request the Committee to waive the
          restrictions on transfer.  As a condition to granting
          this request, the Committee may require the Eligible
          Employee to accept a reduction in the number of
          Shares subject to the Option granted pursuant to
          Section 6 equal to three (3) times the aggregate
          number of Shares issued to the Eligible Employee
          pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 multiplied by
          a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
          Shares for which the restrictions on transfer will
          not be waived and the denominator of which is three
          (3) times the number of Shares purchased by and
          issued to the Eligible Employee pursuant to this
          Section 5.  In the event of any transfer, conveyance
          or pledge of the Shares during the period the
          restrictions on transfer are applicable that is
          effected without the consent of the Committee, the
          reduction in the number of Shares subject to the
          Option granted pursuant to Section 6 will occur
          automatically as of the date of that transfer,
          conveyance or pledge.  If an Eligible Employee
          terminates employment with or retires from the
          Company prior to the time restrictions on transfer
          lapse, then the restrictions on transfer
          automatically shall be deemed to have been waived by
          the Committee effective as of the time of termination
          or retirement."

                              5.

     Section 6 of the Plan is hereby amended by deleting the first paragraph
thereof and by substituting therefor the following:

               "Each Eligible Employee who elects to purchase
          Shares, as described in Section 5 above, shall be
          granted an option to purchase Shares in an amount
          equal to three (3) times the aggregate number of
          Shares issued to him under the provisions of Section
          5 above, subject to reduction if the restrictions on
          transfer described in Section 5 are waived."

                              6.

     Section 6 of the Plan is hereby amended by deleting the existing
Subsection (b) thereof and by substituting therefor the following:

               "(b) state the option price which shall be the
          fair market value of the Shares as of the date
          designated by the Committee, which fair market value
          shall be determined in accordance with Section 5(i),
          (ii) or (iii) of the Plan;"

                              7.

     Section 6 of the Plan also is hereby amended by deleting from Subsection
(h) thereof the following:

          ", reducing the resultant product by the number of
          Shares which the Eligible Employee has previously
          purchased under the Option".

                              8.

     Section 7 of the Plan shall be amended by deleting therefrom the phrase:
"equal in value to fifteen (15%) percent of the fair market value of Shares
an Eligible Employee has elected to purchase,".

     Except as specifically amended by this First Amendment, the Plan shall
remain in full force and effect as prior to this First Amendment.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this First Amendment to be
executed on the day and year first above written.

     A.   Eligibility

     the date he or she is notified in writing by the Plan Administrator of
     his or her eligibility.

     B.   Insurability

     Notwithstanding Section III. A. above, an Employee shall not participate
     in the Plan unless and until he or she satisfies the requirements for
     obtaining a Policy.

     C.   Election Not to Participate

     An Employee may elect not to participate in the Plan at any time.  Such
     election shall be in writing and shall become effective upon its receipt
     by the Plan Administrator.  No compensation or benefits in place of
     participation in the Plan shall be paid to an Employee who elects not
     to participate.

     D.   Cessation of Participation

     An Employee shall cease to be a Plan participant as of the date the
     Company ceases to make further premium payments on the Split Dollar
     Policy owned by the Participant at such time as determined by the Plan
     Administrator in its sole discretion, except as otherwise may be
     provided by the terms of the applicable Split Dollar Life Insurance
     Agreement.

IV.  ASSIGNMENT

Subject to the Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreement and the collateral
assignment in favor of the Company attached as Exhibit "A" thereto, an
Employee may assign to one or more individuals or trustees all or any part of
the Employee's right, title, claim, interest, benefit and all other incidents
of ownership that the Employee may have in the Split Dollar Policy.  Such
assignee shall then have all rights and obligations that have been assigned. 
In the event that there has been such an assignment, the term "Employee" shall
mean the Employee's assignee (or any subsequent assignee) as the context
requires unless the assignee is the Company.

V.   DIVIDENDS OR CREDITED INTEREST

All dividends or credited interest paid on an Employee's Split Dollar Policy
while such Employee is a participant in this Plan will be applied to purchase
additional life insurance within the Split Dollar Policy on the life of the
Employee.

VI.  OWNERSHIP

The Employee will be the owner of the Split Dollar Policy and will hold the
right to exercise all ownership rights granted by the terms of the Split
Dollar Policy, except to the extent such rights are specifically limited by
the terms of the Plan or the applicable Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreement.

VII. COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT OF SECURITY INTEREST

An Employee will be required to assign certain rights of the Employee in the
Split Dollar Policy to the Company to secure the Company's rights under the
Split Dollar Policy.  This assignment will be made by the Employee's execution
of a Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreement and the collateral assignment
attached thereto as Exhibit "A" at the time the Employee becomes a participant
in the Plan.  The Company will not assign its security interest in the Split
Dollar Policy to anyone other than the Employee.

VIII.ANNUAL BENEFIT

The Annual Benefit provided to an Employee participating in the Plan shall be
an amount equal to a premium amount, together with the portion of the premium
amount paid by the Employee, necessary to maintain in effect the Split Dollar
Policy for that Plan Year at a level of life insurance coverage as follows:

     A.   During Employment

     If the Employee dies prior to termination of employment with the Company
     and any of its affiliates, the Employee's Beneficiary would be entitled
     to receive as a death benefit under the Split Dollar Policy an amount
     equal to the Employee's Final Compensation multiplied by four (4),
     rounded to the next highest $1,000, less the amount of the Employee's
     group term life insurance coverage then provided by the Company.

     B.   After Retirement

     At the time of an Employee's Retirement, the Split Dollar Policy's cash
     surrender value would be intended to be sufficient to provide a post-
     retirement death benefit equal to the Employee's Final Compensation
     multiplied by two (2), rounded to the next highest $1,000.

The Company does not guarantee the sufficiency of its premium payment
assistance to maintain the level of insurance coverages described in this
Section VIII.

IX.  ENFORCEMENT OF COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT

Upon an Employee's cessation of participation in the Plan, the Company shall
withdraw or borrow from or against the Split Dollar Policy an amount equal to
its Net Premium Outlay or, where applicable, the full cash surrender value of
the Split Dollar Policy and, if applicable, the amount of any tax withholding
obligations as described in Section X.  Upon recovering such amounts, the
Company will reassign its rights in the Split Dollar Policy to the Employee,
and the Employee's rights with respect to the Split Dollar Policy will be
unrestricted.

X.   TAX LIABILITY AND WITHHOLDING

The rights of an Employee in the Split Dollar Policy may cause the Employee
to be treated as having gross income for federal, state or local income tax
purposes.  These circumstances may also impose upon the Company an obligation
to deduct and collect federal, state or local withholding taxes.  Unless the
Employee otherwise provides the Company the amounts it is required to
withhold, the Company may satisfy its withholding obligations by borrowing
against the Split Dollar Policy in an amount equal to its withholding tax
liability.

XI.  BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

The Employee shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or
persons as the Beneficiary to whom payment under the Plan shall be made in the
event of the Employee's death. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation
form, when accepted by the Insurer, will cancel any Beneficiary designation
previously filed.

If an Employee fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all
designated Beneficiaries predecease the Employee or die prior to the complete
distribution of the Employee's death benefits, the Employee's death benefits
shall be paid to the Employee's then surviving spouse, or, if none, to the
Employee's estate, unless directed otherwise by the court that has
jurisdiction over the assets belonging to the Employee's probate estate.

XII. ERISA PLAN

This Plan is covered by Title I of ERISA as a welfare benefit plan.  The
Company is the "named fiduciary" of the Plan.

XIII.ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

     A.   Operation of the Plan Administrator  The Company shall be the Plan
Administrator, unless it appoints another Plan Administrator.  If an
organization is appointed to serve as the Plan Administrator, then the Plan
Administrator may designate in writing a person who may act on behalf of the
Plan Administrator.  The Company shall have the right to remove the Plan
Administrator at any time by notice in writing.  The Plan Administrator may
resign at any time by written notice of resignation to the Company.  Upon
removal or resignation, or in the event of the dissolution of the Plan
Administrator, the Company shall appoint a successor.

     B.   Duties of the Plan Administrator

          1.   The Plan Administrator shall perform any act which the Plan
     authorizes or requires of the Plan Administrator by action taken in
     compliance with the Plan and may designate in writing other persons to
     carry out its duties under the Plan.  The Plan Administrator may employ
     persons to render advice with regard to any of the Plan Administrator's
     duties.

          2.   The Plan Administrator shall from time to time establish
     rules, not contrary to the provisions of the Plan, for the
     administration of the Plan and the transaction of its business.  All
     elections and designations under the Plan by a participating Employee
     or Beneficiary shall be made on forms prescribed by the Plan
     Administrator.  The Plan Administrator shall have discretionary
     authority to construe the terms of the Plan and shall determine all
     questions arising in the administration, interpretation and application
     of the Plan, including, but not limited to, those concerning eligibility
     for benefits and it shall not act so as to discriminate in favor of any
     person.  All determinations of the Plan Administrator shall be
     conclusive and binding on all Employees and Beneficiaries, subject to
     the provisions of the Plan and subject to applicable law.

          3.   The Plan Administrator shall furnish Employees and
     Beneficiaries with all disclosures now or hereafter required by ERISA. 
     The Plan Administrator shall file, as required, the various reports and
     disclosures concerning the Plan and its operations as required by ERISA
     and by the Internal Revenue Code, and shall be solely responsible for
     establishing and maintaining all records of the Plan.

          4.   The statement of specific duties for a Plan Administrator
     in this Section is not in derogation of any other duties which a Plan
     Administrator has under the provisions of the Plan or under applicable
     law.

          5.   The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each person
     constituting the Plan Administrator from and against any and all claims
     and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and related
     costs) arising in connection with the performance by the person of his
     or her duties in that capacity, other than any of the foregoing arising
     in connection with the willful neglect or willful misconduct of the
     person acting.

     C.   Action by the Company   Any action to be taken by the Company
shall be taken by resolution or written direction duly adopted by the Board
or appropriate governing body, as the case may be; provided, however, that by
such resolution or written direction, the Board or appropriate governing body,
as the case may be, may delegate to any officer or other appropriate person
of the Company the authority to take any such actions as may be specified in
such resolution or written direction, other than the power to amend or
terminate the Plan or to determine the basis of any payment obligations of the
Company.

XIV. CLAIM REVIEW PROCEDURE

     A.   In the event that an Employee or Beneficiary is denied a claim for
benefits under the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall provide to such claimant
written notice of the denial which shall set forth:

          1.   the specific reasons for the denial;

          2.   specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan
     on which the denial is based;

          3.   a description of any additional material or information
     necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
     why such material or information is necessary; and

          4.   an explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.

     B.   After receiving written notice of the denial of a claim, a
claimant or his or her representative may:

          1.   request a full and fair review of such denial by written
     application to the Plan Administrator;

          2.   review pertinent documents; and

          3.   submit issues and comments in writing to the Plan
     Administrator.

     C.   If the claimant wishes such a review of the decision denying his
or her claim to benefits under the Plan, he or she must submit such written
applications to the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after receiving
written notice of the denial.

     D.   Upon receiving such written application for review, the Plan
Administrator may schedule a hearing for purposes of reviewing the claimant's
claim, which hearing shall take place not more than thirty (30) days from the
date on which the Plan Administrator received such written application for
review.

     E.   At least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the
claimant and his or her representative designated in writing by him or her,
if any, shall receive written notice of the date, time, and place of such
scheduled hearing.  The claimant or his or her representative, if any, may
request that the hearing be rescheduled, for his or her convenience, on
another reasonable date or at another reasonable time or place.

     F.   All claimants requesting a review of the decision denying their
claim for benefits may employ counsel for purposes of the hearing.

     G.   No later than sixty (60) days following the receipt of the written
application for review, the Plan Administrator shall submit its decision on
the review in writing to the claimant involved and to his or her
representative, if any; provided, however, a decision on the written
application for review may be extended, in the event special circumstances
such as the need to hold a hearing require an extension of time, to a day no
later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of receipt of the
written application for review.  The decision shall include specific reasons
for the decision and specific references to the pertinent provisions of the
Plan on which the decision is based.

XV.  LIMITATION OF ASSIGNMENT

     A.   No benefit which shall be payable under the Plan to any person
shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall
be void; and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable for, or subject to,
the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person, nor
shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for, or against, such
person, and the same shall not be recognized under the Plan, except to such
extent as may be required by law.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to
invalidate any collateral assignment executed by an Employee in favor of the
Company pursuant to the terms of a Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreement.

     B.   If any person who shall be entitled to any benefit under the Plan
shall become bankrupt or shall attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge such benefit under the Plan, then
the payment of any such benefit in the event an Employee or Beneficiary is
entitled to payment shall, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, cease
and terminate and in that event the Plan Administrator shall hold or apply the
same for the benefit of such person, his or her spouse, children, other
dependents or any of them in such manner and in such proportion as the Plan
Administrator shall determine.

XVI. LIMITATION OF RIGHTS

     Membership in the Plan shall not give any Employee any right or claim
except to the extent that such right is specifically fixed under the terms of
the Plan.  The adoption of the Plan by the Company shall not be construed to
give any Employee a right to be continued in the employ of the Company or any
of its affiliates or as interfering with the right of the Company or any of
its affiliates to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time.

XVII.AMENDMENT TO OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

     The Company reserves the right at any time to modify or amend or
terminate the Plan.  No such modifications or amendments shall have the effect

general assets of the Company and no separate fund shall be established to
secure payment.

Plan all federal, state and local income taxes or other taxes required to be
withheld pursuant to applicable law.

     C.   By maintaining the Plan and providing the Annual Benefits
described herein, the Company makes no agreement, expressed or implied, or
other representation relating to the amount or nature of benefits payable
under any Policy, the ability of any insurer to provide benefits under any
Policy or the federal, state or local tax consequences resulting from
execution of a Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreement.

     D.   Participation in the Plan shall not be construed as providing any
evidence of an agreement, express or implied, to retain an Employee in the
employ of the Company or any of its affiliates.

     E.   To the extent not preempted by applicable federal law, the Plan
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Alabama.

     F.   The captions of the sections and paragraphs of the Plan are for
convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction
of any of its provisions.

                   MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC.
              PERFORMANCE STOCK RIGHTS AGREEMENT



     THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of this  1st  day of July,
1993, by and between MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company") and SAMUEL E. BEALL, III (the "Recipient").


                          Background


     A.   The Company has adopted the Morrison Restaurants Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan (the "Plan") for the purpose of securing and retaining the
services of officers and key employees of the Company and its affiliates by
promoting and increasing their personal interests in the welfare of the
Company and by providing incentive to those who are primarily responsible for
the operations of the Company and for shaping and carrying out the long-range
plans of the Company and aiding in its continued growth and financial success.

     B.   The Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Committee") has authorized the grant to
Recipient of performance stock rights under Section 3.7 of the Plan to receive
a specified number of shares of the common stock, par value $.01 per share,
("Common Stock") of the Company subject to the conditions stated herein. 

     C.   The Company and Recipient wish to confirm herein the terms,
conditions, and restrictions of the performance stock rights.

     For and in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants contained
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree:


                           Section 1
               Award of Performance Stock Rights

     1.1  Award of Performance Stock Rights.  Subject to the terms,
restrictions, limitations, and conditions stated herein and in the Plan, the
Company hereby awards to Recipient the conditional right to be paid up to an
aggregate of 50,000 shares of Common Stock at the time or times and subject
to the conditions stated herein (the "Performance Stock").

     1.2  Grant of Performance Stock upon Attainment of Award Levels.  The
Recipient shall be granted the number of shares of Performance Stock indicated
below if the Average Price indicated below for an Award Level is first
attained after June 1, 1993 during its Corresponding Determination Year:



                                 Number of             
Corresponding
 Award Level        Average Price       Shares Issuable    
Determination Year

    One        $34.50             10,000     June 1, 1993 - May 31,1994
    Two        $39.675            10,000     June 1, 1994 - May 31,1995
   Three       $45.626            10,000     June 1, 1995 - May 31,1996
    Four       $52.470            10,000     June 1, 1996 - May 31,1997
    Five       $60.341            10,000     June 1, 1997 - May 31,1998

No Shares of Performance Stock shall be issuable because an Award Level is
attained in any Determination Year other than the Corresponding Determination
Year for that Award Level, except as provided below:

          (a)  if an Award Level is first attained after June 1, 1993 in
     a Determination Year occurring prior to the Corresponding Determination
     Year for that Award Level, the Recipient shall be issued, subject to
     Section 1.4 below, those shares of Performance Stock issuable with
     respect to attainment of that Award Level; and

          (b)  if an Award Level is attained in its Corresponding
     Determination Year, the Recipient shall be issued those shares of
     Performance Stock issuable with respect to attainment of that Award
     Level plus those shares of Performance Stock issuable with respect to
     attainment of lesser Award Levels, but which have not been previously
     issued to the Recipient.

     1.3  Grant of Performance Stock upon a Triggering Event.  If there is
a Triggering Event and the Triggering Event Price exceeds $30.00, the
Recipient shall be entitled to a grant of a number of shares of Performance
Stock determined pursuant to the following formula:  50,000 multiplied by X,
reduced by Y.  In the foregoing formula, "X" is the lesser of (a) the
(Triggering Event Price minus $30) divided by $30.341 or (b) one (1) and "Y"
is the number of shares of Performance Stock which previously became issuable
to the Recipient under Section 1.2.  No shares of Performance Stock shall be
issuable with respect to any subsequent Triggering Event occurring after the
occurrence of the first Triggering Event.  If the formula in this Section 1.3
produces a negative number, the Recipient shall not be entitled to any grant
of Performance Stock pursuant to this Section 1.3; however, the Recipient
shall not be required to return any shares of Performance Stock previously
issued to him pursuant to Section 1.2 above.

any such stock certificates and any cash dividends until the first to occur
of the events listed below and shall deliver the stock certificates and any
cash dividends to either the Recipient or the Company depending upon which
event occurs first, as indicated below:

          (a)  if the Award Level is attained again in the Corresponding

     Determination Year for an Award Level, any stock certificate
     representing shares of Performance Stock issued due to the prior

     certificates issued with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1 below
     and cash dividends paid with respect to shares held by the Share
     Custodian, shall be delivered to the Recipient;

          (c)  upon the Recipient's death or voluntary Termination of
     Employment due to Constructive Discharge, or upon a Termination of
     Employment by the Company other than for Cause, all stock certificates
     then held by the Share Custodian, stock certificates issued with respect
     thereto pursuant to Section 3.1 below and cash dividends paid with
     respect to shares held by the Share Custodian, shall be delivered to the
     Recipient; or

          (d)  upon the Recipient's voluntary Termination of Employment,
     other than a Termination of Employment due to Constructive Discharge,
     or upon a Termination of Employment for Cause, all stock certificates
     then held by the Share Custodian, stock certificates issued with respect
     thereto pursuant to Section 3.1 below and cash dividends paid with
     respect to shares held by the Share Custodian, shall be delivered to the
     Company. 

Recipient hereby irrevocably appoints the Share Custodian as the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact of Recipient with the full power and authority to
execute any stock transfer power or other instrument necessary to transfer
shares of Performance Stock and other stock certificates held by the Share
Custodian to the Company in accordance with this Section 1.6 in the name of
Recipient.  The Shares Custodian's term of appointment shall expire on June
1, 1998.

     1.7  Condition to Issuance or Release of Performance Stock Certificate. 
As a condition precedent to the issuance of any stock certificate pursuant to
Section 1.5 hereof or the release of any stock certificate pursuant to Section
1.6 hereof, Recipient shall first pay to the Company an amount sufficient to
satisfy applicable federal, state and local withholding tax requirements.

     1.8  Rights as Stockholder.  Recipient shall have no rights as a
stockholder with respect to any shares of Performance Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 1.2 or 1.3 hereof until a stock certificate for the shares is
issued in Recipient's name.  No adjustments shall be made pursuant to Section
3.1 hereof for dividends paid or declared on or with respect to Common Stock
in cash, securities other than Common Stock, or other property for which the
record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued.  During the
period that shares of Performance Stock are held by the Share Custodian,
Recipient shall be entitled to all rights attendant to shares of Common Stock
not so held, except as follows:  (a) if additional shares of Common Stock
become issuable to Recipient due to an event described in Section 3.1 below,
any stock certificate representing such shares shall be delivered to the Share
Custodian and those shares of Common Stock shall be subject to forfeiture to
the same extent as the shares of Performance Stock to which they relate; and
(b) if any cash dividends are paid with respect to shares of Performance Stock
held by the Share Custodian, those cash dividends shall be delivered to the
Share Custodian who shall, in turn, deliver the cash dividends with the shares
of Performance Stock to which they relate to either the Recipient or the
Company, as determined pursuant to Section 1.6 above.

     1.9  Registration of Performance Stock.  The Company will use its best
efforts to assure that the shares of Performance Stock will be registered for
issuance to Recipient under the Securities Act of 1933 at the time or times
of issuance.

Mr. Joseph Byrum
4272 Bit & Spur Road
Mobile, Alabama  36608

Via Hand Delivery

Dear Joe:

This confirms the terms of the agreement which you and I have reached
concerning your employment status following numerous discussions over the past
two months or more.

This letter, together with the Offer/Agreement and Waiver of Rights contained
herein, represents a proposed employment and benefits package covering your
status with Morrison Restaurants Inc. (the "Company").  Upon your acceptance,
both of us will acknowledge our agreement with the terms and conditions
specified in the Offer/ Agreement (the "Offer/Agreement") and Waiver of Rights
(the "Waiver") set forth in this letter (the Offer/Agreement and Waiver
collectively referred to herein as the "Agreement").  

In consideration of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, you
and the Company agree as follows:


                        OFFER/AGREEMENT

This Offer/Agreement constitutes an offer to you by the Company, its
affiliates and subsidiaries.  It is important that you read and understand the
terms of this Offer/Agreement in full and that if you decide to sign it, that
you do so knowingly and voluntarily.  To enable you to do that, we suggest
that you consult with an attorney about this Offer/Agreement and your rights
before signing it.  You will not, however, waive or give up any rights or
claims you may have against the Company that may arise after the date that you
sign this Offer/Agreement.

The Company's offer that is described in this Offer/Agreement will remain open
and effective for twenty-one (21) days from May 20, 1994, the "Effective Date"
of the Offer/Agreement.  You have ample time to elect to accept or reject this
offer within that time period.  If you decide to sign the Offer/Agreement and
waive your rights against the Company, you will have seven (7) days following
the signing and return of the signed Offer/ Agreement to change your mind and
revoke the Offer/Agreement.  In other words, the Offer/Agreement will not be
in effect until seven (7) days have passed following your signing.


                         CONSIDERATION

In consideration of the terms and conditions contained in this
Offer/Agreement, you and the Company agree as follows:

A.   General Severance Factors

     1.  You are aware that the Company is trying to locate a purchaser for
     the Business and Industry (Education) assets of the Morrison Hospitality
     Group ("B&I").  Accordingly, this Offer/Agreement is conditioned on your
     positive participation, efforts and role in: (i) a smooth transition to
     the purchaser, (ii) continuing to motivate employees of B&I, (iii)
     acting as a positive influence and positive force on the B&I team, and
     (iv) continuing to generate earnings in accordance with your B&I
     strategic and financial plan (all such factors hereinafter collectively
     referred to as the "Smooth Transition").  The Offer/Agreement is
     voidable by the Company upon your failure to carry out your
     responsibilities for the Smooth Transition.

     2.  You will remain on the Company's payroll and in the event your
     status as a management employee of the Company is involuntarily
     terminated by the Company at any time within twelve (12) months from the
     date of this letter, then the Company will continue to employ you and
     to pay your then current base salary from the date of termination of
     that status for twelve (12) months, payable bi-weekly, plus a prorated
     bonus to the date of the involuntary termination of your status as a
     management employee, provided your strategic and financial plan earnings
     for B&I have been met through the date of involuntary termination.  The
     1-year guarantee of base salary and prorated bonus are hereinafter
     referred to as the "1-Year Compensation Guarantee".  No 1-Year
     Compensation Guarantee will be paid if you remain a management employee
     of the Company for the twelve (12) months following the date of this
     letter.  You will not be eligible for any future bonuses other than the
     bonus referenced in this Section 2.


     3.  Following the later of the end of either continuation of your
     employment status as a management employee of the Company covering the
     twelve (12) months from the date of this letter or the period of the 1-
     Year Compensation Guarantee, you will remain employed by the Company to
     age 55 (the "Bridge Period"), with an annual salary during the Bridge
     Period, payable bi-weekly, being paid to you equal to the annual
     retirement payment amount which you would receive based on the
     retirement option you will be eligible for at age 55.  In consideration
     of said salary, you shall provide consulting or other mutually agreed
     upon services during the Bridge Period.  You will notify us 90 days
     before commencement of the Bridge Period of the retirement option that
     you will select at age 55, and the retirement option selected will not
     be changed.  Your retirement plan calculations will be based on the
     Executive Supplemental Pension Plan (the "ESP") formula and will be
     determined by your current base salary as of the commencement of the
     Bridge Period.
     
     4.  Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 4, as an employee of
     the Company during the Bridge Period, you will be entitled to group
     medical, life and disability benefits which are made available from time
     to time to similarly situated employees.  Also, since you will continue
     to be an employee to age 55, you will be entitled to any medical
     insurance benefits at age 55 which similarly situated employees are then
     entitled to who retire or terminate employment at that age.

     Effective as of the day immediately prior to the commencement of the
     Bridge Period (the "Conversion Date"), your participation in the
     Morrison Restaurants Inc. Executive Life Insurance Plan (the "ELIP")
     will cease; provided, however, that the terms of the Split Dollar
     Agreement, dated as of January 1, 1994, between you and the Company (the
     "Split Dollar Agreement"), are hereby modified effective as of the day
     immediately following the Conversion Date, as follows:  (1)
     notwithstanding existing Sections III and and Section IV of the Split
     Dollar Agreement, premium payments and bonus payments by the Company
     shall continue during the Bridge Period notwithstanding the cessation
     of your participation in the ELIP; (2) notwithstanding existing Section
     VI of the Split Dollar Agreement, the death benefit payable to your
     designated beneficiary shall be four times your annual salary earned
     during the Bridge Period, rounded to the next highest $1,000 and reduced
     by any death benefit payable under any Company-provided group term life
     insurance coverage; and (3) notwithstanding existing Section VII of the
     Split Dollar Agreement, the Split Dollar Agreement, as so modified,
     shall terminate on the last day of the Bridge Period.  As of the day
     immediately following the Conversion Date, the provisions of the Split
     Dollar Agreement not specifically modified hereby shall be construed by
     the parties in a manner consistent with the intent reflected by the
     foregoing modifications.

     5.  Your employee's share of medical insurance premium payments due the
     Company will be deducted from your bi-weekly salary.

     6.  Your Fiscal 1994 bonus will be based on actual.

     7.  You have the option of either returning to the Company or purchasing
     any Company automobile driven by you.  If you elect to purchase, you may
     do so at the Hospitality Group's net book value as of the date that you
     cease management employee status.

     8.  All of your Stock Options which by the terms of their plan documents
     would otherwise expire upon a termination or change of your employment
     status with the Company will remain exercisable as you will remain an
     employee of the Company through the expiration of the Bridge Period and
     may be exercised when such Stock Options become exercisable under the
     terms of their plans.  See Exhibit A for a listing of your stock
     options.  Stock Options not exercised by their expiration date under the
     terms of their respective plans will automatically terminate.  You will
     be subject to exercising the Stock Options as an employee of the Company
     and will be still fully subject to all the terms and conditions of such
     plans which are not in conflict with the exercise privilege extended to
     you under this Agreement.  You will not be eligible for any stock
     options other than those listed on Exhibit A.
 
     9.  In return for the consideration paid you pursuant to the terms of
     this Offer/Agreement, you will sign a non-competition agreement in which
     you will recognize and agree:  (i) that you have established significant
     contacts and personal relationships dealing with the goodwill of the
     Company in the geographical area served by the B&I business being sold
     and the Company's health care business, and (ii) that you would develop
     numerous new contacts with potential B&I and health care customers and
     potential contracts in the future.  Therefore, you will agree that for
     a period of three (3) years from the Effective Date of this
     Offer/Agreement you will not, in the continental United States, compete
     with the Company, its successors and assigns, in the health care field. 
     Additionally, you will also agree as a covenant and condition running
     in favor of the Company and any third party purchaser of B&I that for
     a period of three (3) years from the Effective Date of this
     Offer/Agreement you will not compete with such third party purchaser in
     the B&I field.
     
     10.  Following termination of your employment status with the Company,
     we agree to provide you with information covering your health insurance
     entitlements under COBRA and other employee benefits at termination. 
     You will hear directly from the appropriate Company Benefits/Insurance
     Plan Administrator, explaining these matters at that time.

                             PROMISSORY NOTE


$400,000.00                                                 June 3, 1994


      FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Joe B. Byrum ("Maker"), promises
to pay to the order of Custom Management Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation (herein, along with each subsequent holder of this Note, referred
to as the "Holder"), the principal sum of FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
($400,000.00), with interest on the outstanding principal balance of this Note
from the date hereof until fully paid at a simple interest rate of eight
percent (8%) per annum, as hereinafter provided.

      This Note shall be paid as follows:

            (a)  On the first anniversary of this Note, Maker shall pay to
      Holder all interest accrued during the prior year on the outstanding
      principal balance of this Note; and

            (b)  At the end of the first quarter following the first
      anniversary of this Note, and at the end of each subsequent quarter,
      Maker shall pay to Holder an amount equal to fifty thousand dollars
      ($50,000.00), plus all interest accrued on the outstanding principal
      balance of this Note at such time, until this Note has been paid in
      full. 

      Should any installment of principal or interest not be paid when due,
the Holder shall have the right to declare the unpaid principal of and
interest on this Note to be forthwith due and payable.  Any payment of
principal or interest which is not paid when due shall bear interest until
paid at a simple interest rate equal to twelve percent (12%) per annum;
provided, however, that delinquent installments of interest shall not bear
interest if and to the extent prohibited by applicable law.  

      The principal hereof and interest hereon shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America, at the Holder's principal office in
Mobile, Alabama, or at such other place as the Holder hereof may designate in
writing to Maker.  The Maker may prepay this Note in full or in part at any
time without notice, penalty, prepayment fee, or payment of unearned interest. 
All payments hereunder received from Maker by the Holder shall be applied
first to interest to the extent then accrued and then to principal, in inverse
order of maturity.

      This Note has been delivered pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement between Maker and Holder of even date herewith and is secured by a
Stock Pledge Agreement of even date herewith executed by Maker in favor of the
Holder and Morrison Restaurants Inc. and granting a security interest in
certain capital stock of Morrison Restaurants Inc., a Delaware corporation,
and of Morrison Crothall Support Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, owned
by Maker.

      All parties liable for the payment of this Note agree to pay the Holder
hereof reasonable attorneys' fees for the services of counsel employed to
collect this Note, whether or not suit be brought, and whether incurred in
connection with collection, trial, appeal, or otherwise, and to indemnify and
hold the Holder harmless against liability for the payment of state
intangible, documentary and recording taxes, and other taxes (including
interest and penalties, if any) which may be determined to be payable with
respect to this transaction.

      In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable hereunder exceed
the maximum rate of interest allowed by applicable law, and in the event any
such payment is inadvertently paid by Maker or inadvertently received by the
Holder, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal,
unless Maker shall notify the Holder, in writing, that Maker elects to have
such excess sum returned to it forthwith.  It is the express intent hereof
that Maker not pay and the Holder not receive, directly or indirectly, in any
manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by
the Maker under applicable law.

      The remedies of the Holder as provided herein and in any other documents
governing or securing repayment hereof shall be cumulative and concurrent and
may be pursued singly, successively, or together, at the sole discretion of
the Holder, and may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise.

      No act of omission or commission of the Holder, including specifically
any failure to exercise any right, remedy, or recourse, shall be effective
unless set forth in a written document executed by the Holder, and then only
to the extent specifically recited therein.  A waiver or release with
reference to one event shall not be construed as continuing, as a bar to, or
as a waiver or release of any subsequent right, remedy, or recourse as to any
subsequent event.

      Maker and all sureties, endorsers, and guarantors of this Note hereby
(a) waive demand, presentment of payment, notice of nonpayment, protest,
notice of protest and all other notice, filing of suit, and diligence in
collecting this Note, or in enforcing any of its rights under any guaranties
securing the repayment hereof; (b) agree to any substitution, addition, or
release of any collateral or any party or person primarily or secondarily
liable hereon; (c) agree that the Holder shall not be required first to
institute any suit, or to exhaust his/her, their, or its remedies against
Maker or any other person or party to become liable hereunder, or against any
collateral in order to enforce payment of this Note; (d) consent to any
extension, rearrangement, renewal, or postponement of time of payment of this
Note and to any other indulgence with respect hereto without notice, consent,
or consideration to any of them; and (e) agree that, notwithstanding the
occurrence of any of the foregoing (except with the express written release
by the Holder or any such person), they shall be and remain jointly and
severally, directly and primarily, liable for all sums due under this Note.

      Maker and all endorsers or other parties to this Note severally waive,
each for himself/herself and family, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, any and all homestead and exemption rights which any of them
or the family of any of them may have under or by virtue of the Constitution
or laws of the United States of America or of any state as against this Note,
any renewal hereof, or any indebtedness represented hereby.

      Whenever used in this Note, the words "Maker" and "Holder" shall be
deemed to include Maker and the Holder named in the opening paragraph of this
Note, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal
representatives, successors, and assigns.  It is expressly understood and
agreed that the Holder shall never be construed for any purpose as a partner,
joint venturer, co-principal, or associate of Maker, or of any person or party
claiming by, through, or under Maker in the conduct of their respective
businesses.

      Time is of the essence of this Note.

      This Note shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws
of the State of Alabama. 

      The pronouns used herein shall include, when appropriate, either gender
and both singular and plural, and the grammatical construction of sentences

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Maker has executed this instrument
under seal as of the day and year first above written.

                                GUARANTEE


      THIS GUARANTEE is entered into this 3rd day of June, 1994, by Joe B.
Byrum (the "Guarantor") in favor of Morrison Restaurants Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Morrison") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Custom Management
Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("CMC"). 


                          W I T N E S S E T H:


      WHEREAS, CMC and the Guarantor have entered into that certain Stock
Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof (the "Agreement") for the sale of
three thousand nine hundred and seventeen (3,917) shares of common stock of
Morrison Crothall Support Services, Inc. ("Crothall");

      WHEREAS, as a condition to the Agreement, Crothall executed and
delivered to CMC that certain Indemnity Agreement dated May 18, 1994 in favor
of CMC (the "Indemnity Agreement");

      WHEREAS, Crothall and CMC are parties to that certain Loan and Security
Agreement dated October 1, 1991, pursuant to which Crothall currently owes CMC
approximately $2.5 million (the "Loan Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, in connection with the Agreement, the Guarantor has agreed to
guarantee all obligations, financial or otherwise, of Crothall to CMC or
Morrison, however incurred or evidenced, whether absolute or contingent,
direct or indirect, now existing or hereafter arising or due or to become due,
including, but not limited to, Crothall's obligations under the Indemnity
Agreement and the Loan Agreement (hereinafter, all of the foregoing
obligations of Crothall being referred to as the "Obligations");

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises, and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned Guarantor does hereby unconditionally guarantee
to CMC and Morrison that Crothall will fully and promptly perform, pay and
discharge all present and future obligations of Crothall to CMC or Morrison
with respect to the Obligations and does further unconditionally guarantee to
CMC and Morrison the prompt payment when due of any and all Obligations.  The
obligations of the undersigned with respect to the Obligations shall not be
diminished by any right or power of any third party to assert any claim of
defense as to the invalidity or unenforceability of any such Obligations, and
no such claim or defense shall impair or affect the obligations of the
undersigned hereunder.  The undersigned does further agree, without CMC or
Morrison first having to proceed against Crothall or to liquidate any security
therefor, to pay on demand (i) all sums due and to become due CMC or Morrison
from Crothall with respect to the Obligations and (ii) all costs, attorneys'
fees or expenses which may be suffered or incurred by CMC or Morrison by
reason of a default by Crothall or the undersigned, in the payment or
performance of the Obligations or in enforcing the obligations of the
undersigned hereunder.

      The undersigned agrees that the liability assumed hereunder is primary,
direct, unconditional and enforceable without prior resort to Crothall, and
it shall not be affected by any forbearance, extension of the time of payment,
settlement, composition, release, waiver or modification, express or implied,
of any of the Obligations hereby guaranteed, made by or entered into by CMC
or Morrison with Crothall or with the undersigned or with any other person,
form or corporation, or by any release, substitution or alteration of, or
failure to obtain or perfect interest in, any security therefor permitted by
CMC or Morrison.  It is fully understood by the undersigned that until each
and every one of the covenants and agreements of this Guarantee is fully
performed, the undersigned's undertakings hereunder shall not be released, in
whole or in part, by any action or thing which might, but for this provision
of this Guarantee, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or
guarantor, or by reason of any waiver, extension, modification, forbearance
or delay or other act or omission of CMC or Morrison or their failure to
proceed promptly or otherwise, or by reason of any action taken or omitted by
CMC or Morrison, whether or not such action or failure to act varies or
increases the risk of, or affects the rights or remedies of the undersigned,
or by reason of any further dealing among Crothall and CMC or Morrison, and
the undersigned hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defense to the
performance of the undertakings of the undersigned based upon any of the
foregoing acts, omissions, agreements or waivers of any of them; it being the
purpose and the intent of the parties hereto that the covenants, agreements
and all undertakings hereunder are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable
under any and all circumstances.

      This Guarantee is intended to be, and it is a continuing Guarantee and
shall continue in force until all principal, interest and other amounts due
in respect of the Obligations have been paid in full and all obligations
hereunder have been performed.  This Guarantee shall continue in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the dissolution, termination, winding
up or other discontinuation of Crothall or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of Crothall, the marshaling of assets and
liabilities of Crothall, or the receivership, bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of,
or other similar proceedings affecting, Crothall or any of its assets.  The
liability of the undersigned shall be reinstated and revived, and the rights
of CMC and Morrison shall continue, with respect to any amount at any time
paid on account of the indebtedness guaranteed hereby, which shall thereafter
be required to be restored or returned by CMC or Morrison upon the bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of Crothall or otherwise, all as though such
amount had not been paid.

      The undersigned expressly waives notice of acceptance hereof and of
presentment, demand, notice of intent to accelerate and of acceleration,
protest as to the Obligations, and the undersigned waives all defenses,
setoffs and counterclaims and waives notice of amendment or modification of
the Obligations.  Until the Obligations have been paid or performed in full,
the undersigned expressly waives all rights of subrogation and all rights to
enforce any remedy which CMC or Morrison now has or may hereafter have against
Crothall, and waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any
security now or hereafter held by CMC or Morrison.  CMC or Morrison may,
without notice to the undersigned, renew or extend any obligations of
Crothall, may accept partial payments thereon or settle, release by operation
of law or otherwise, compound, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate any
thereof, and/or security therefor, in any manner, consent to the release or
transfer of such security and bid and purchase at any sale without affecting
or impairing the obligation of the undersigned hereunder.

      The liability of the undersigned hereunder shall not be modified in any
manner whatsoever by an extension that may be granted to Crothall by any court
in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code set forth at 11 U.S.C. Section 101
et seq. or any amendments thereof and the undersigned expressly waives the
benefit of any such extension.

      Payments of all sums of money and the performance of all the covenants
and agreements hereunder shall be payable and due at CMC's office in Mobile,
Alabama. 

      No delay by CMC or Morrison in the exercise of any right or remedy shall
operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by CMC or
Morrison of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.  No action by the CMC
or Morrison permitted hereunder shall in any way impair or affect this
Guarantee.

      It being the express intention of the parties hereto to conform strictly
with the applicable usury laws, it is agreed that nothing contained herein
shall be so construed as to require the payment of interest at a rate in
excess of the maximum allowable by law, and in no event shall the undersigned
be obligated to pay interest exceeding such maximum rate of interest permitted
by law, and all such agreements, conditions, or stipulations, if any, which
may in any event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate, or
compel the undersigned to pay a rate of interest exceeding the maximum rate
of interest permitted by law shall be without binding force or effect at law
or in equity to the extent only of the excess of interest over such maximum
rate of interest permitted by law.  It is the intention of this Guarantee,
that the foregoing sentence shall be given precedence over any other
agreement, condition, or stipulation herein contained which is in conflict
with same.

      This Guarantee shall be binding upon the undersigned, and upon his
successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the transferee,
assignee, or the holder of the Obligations guaranteed herein.

      This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Alabama.  Wherever possible, each provision of this
Guarantee shall be interpreted in such matter as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guarantee shall be held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Guarantee.

      The obligations of the undersigned pursuant to this Guarantee shall be
operative and binding until the earlier to occur of (i) such time as the
Obligations shall have been paid or performed in full, or (ii) the undersigned
shall have satisfied all of its obligations under this Guarantee.
























      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has hereunto executed this Guarantee
as of the date first above written.

and the other documents now or hereafter executed and delivered in connection

all obligations of Pledgors to Pledgees under any note, any loan agreement,
all contracts of suretyship, guaranty or accommodation, and all other

covenants hereinafter set forth, and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Pledgors hereby
covenant and agree with Pledgees as follows:

      1.    Security Interest.  Pledgors hereby grant, convey, and pledge to
Pledgees a security interest in and security title to all of their right,
title, and interest in and to the Stock (subject, however, in the case of the
Crothall Stock, to the terms and conditions of that certain Stockholders
Restrictive Transfer Agreement dated October 1, 1991, between CMC, Crothall
and the Stockholders of Crothall), and have delivered to and deposited with
Pledgees herewith, all stock certificates for Stock presently held by

security for (a) payment and performance of all Obligations, and (b) all
obligations of Pledgors to Pledgees hereunder.  Pledgors have on this date
delivered the Stock to and deposited the Stock with Pledgees, together with
stock powers endorsed in blank.  Pledgors agree that at any time and from time
to time, at the expense of Pledgors, Pledgors will promptly execute and
deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action
that may be necessary, or that Pledgees may reasonably request, in order to
perfect and protect the security interest granted hereby or to enable Pledgees
to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder with respect to
all or any portion of the Stock.

      2.    Warranties; Covenants.  

      (a)   Pledgors hereby jointly and severally warrant and represent to
Pledgees (i) that except for the security interest created hereby, Pledgors
own the shares of the Stock free and clear of all liens, charges, and
encumbrances, (ii) that the Stock is duly issued, fully paid, and
non-assessable, (iii) that Pledgors have the unencumbered and unrestricted
right to pledge the Stock, and (iv) that no consent or approval of any
governmental or regulatory authority, or of any securities exchange, which has
not been obtained was or is necessary to the validity of this pledge.

      (b)   Until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9
hereof, Pledgors jointly and severally covenant that Pledgors will not (i)
sell, convey or otherwise dispose of any of the Stock or any interest therein,
or (b) incur or permit to be incurred any pledge, lien, charge, or encumbrance
or any security interest whatsoever in or with respect to any of the Stock or
the proceeds thereof, other than the security interest created hereby and such
security interests as to which Pledgees have given their prior consent in
writing.

      (c)   Until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9
hereof, Pledgors jointly and severally covenant that Pledgors will (i) warrant
and defend at their own expense Pledgees' right, title and special property
and security interest in and to the Stock against the claims of any person or
entity; and (ii) promptly give notice to Pledgees of any notices received by
Pledgors with respect to the Stock.

      3.    Additional Shares.  In the event that, during the term of this
Agreement:

            (a)  (i) any stock dividend, stock split, reclassification,
      readjustment, or other change is declared or made in the capital
      structure of either Morrison or Crothall (hereinafter referred to as an
      "Issuer") all new, substituted, and additional shares, or other
      securities, issued by reason of any such change with respect to the
      Stock and received by Pledgors or to which Pledgors shall be entitled
      or (ii) any new additional shares or other securities issued by either
      Issuer and received by Pledgors from the exercise of any options for the
      same, shall be immediately delivered to Pledgees, together with stock
      powers endorsed in blank by Pledgors, and shall constitute Stock to be
      held by Pledgees under the terms of this Agreement; and

            (b)  subscriptions, warrants, or any other rights or options
      shall be issued in connection with the Stock, all new stock or other
      securities acquired through such subscriptions, warrants, rights, or
      options by Pledgors shall be immediately delivered to Pledgees and shall
      constitute Stock to be held by Pledgees under the terms of this
      Agreement. 

      4.    Default.  Upon and after the occurrence of a default by Pledgors
with respect to payment or performance of the Obligations, or a default by
Pledgors under the terms of this Agreement (any of such occurrences being
hereinafter referred to as a "Default"):

            (a)  Pledgors shall, upon the written request of Pledgees, at
      Pledgors' election, either (i) exercise any and all options then
      exercisable and then held by Pledgors with respect to the capital stock
      of Morrison ("Options") and deliver such stock to Pledgees in accordance
      with Section 3 above; or (ii) arrange for the "cashless" exercise of
      Options and direct that all pre-tax proceeds from the exercise
      ("Proceeds") be remitted to Pledgees immediately; provided, however,
      that Pledgor shall only be obligated in either case to exercise such
      number of Options, the proceeds of which are sufficient to satisfy any
      default then outstanding; and, provided further, that any taxes payable
      with respect to the exercise of the Options shall be paid by Pledgor and
      shall not be satisfied from the Proceeds; and 

            (b)  Pledgees may sell or otherwise dispose of the Stock or any
      portion of the Stock at a public or private sale or make other
      commercially reasonable disposition of the Stock or any portion thereof
      after five (5) days notice to Pledgors.  Pledgees may, in the name of
      all or any one of them, or in the name of a designee or nominee, buy at
      any public sale of the Stock and, if permitted by law, buy at any
      private sale thereof.  The proceeds of the public or private sale or
      other disposition shall be applied to the costs incurred in connection
      with the sale, expressly including, without limitation, any costs under
      Section 6(a) hereof, and to the other Obligations, in such order as
      Pledgees may determine, and any remaining proceeds shall be paid over
      to Pledgors or others as by law provided.  In the event the proceeds of
      the sale or other disposition of the Stock are insufficient to pay such
      expenses, interest, principal of the Obligations, and damages, Pledgors
      shall remain liable to Pledgees for any such deficiency.  All costs and
      expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred
      by Pledgees in obtaining performance of or in collecting any payments
      due under this Agreement shall be deemed part of the Obligations
      hereunder. 

      5.    Additional Rights of Secured Party.  In addition to their rights
and privileges under this Agreement, Pledgees shall have all the rights,
powers, and privileges of secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State of Alabama and other applicable law.  All rights of Pledgees
shall be cumulative and not exclusive.

      6.    Disposition of Stock by Pledgees.  If the Stock or any portion
thereof is not registered under the various United States federal or state
securities acts, disposition thereof after Default may be restricted to one
or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such
registration.  Pledgors understand that upon such disposition, Pledgees may
approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further
understand that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for
the Stock than if the Stock was registered pursuant to federal and state
securities legislation and sold on the open market.  Pledgors, therefore,
agree that: 

            (a)  if Pledgees shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
      sell or cause the Stock or any portion thereof to be sold at a private
      sale, Pledgees shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion
      of any national brokerage or investment firm having recognized expertise
      and experience in connection with shares of companies similar to the
      Stock (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure
      to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial
      reasonableness of Pledgees' action) as to the best manner in which to
      expose the Stock for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable
      at the private sale thereof; and
            
            (b)  that such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that
      Pledgees have handled such disposition in a commercially reasonable
      manner.

      7.    Pledgors' Obligations Absolute.  The obligations of Pledgors under
this Agreement shall be direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent
upon the pursuit of any remedies against any other person, nor against other
security or liens or encumbrances available to Pledgees or any of their
successors, assigns, or agents.  Pledgors hereby waive any right to require
that an action be brought against any other person or entity or to require
that resort be had to any security or to any balance of any deposit account
or credit on the books of Pledgees in favor of any other person or entity
prior to any exercise of rights or remedies hereunder.

      8.    Voting Rights. 

            (a)  After a Default and for so long as any of the Obligations
      remain unpaid, (i) Pledgees may, upon one (1) day's prior written notice
      to Pledgors of their intention to do so, exercise all voting rights, and
      all other ownership or consensual rights of the Stock, and all rights
      of Byrum under that certain Stockholders Voting Agreement among the
      stockholders of Crothall dated as of October 1, 1991, as amended the
      date hereof ("Voting Agreement") but under no circumstances are Pledgees
      obligated by the terms of this Agreement to exercise such rights, and
      (ii) Pledgors hereby appoint Morrison and its designees Pledgors' true
      and lawful attorney-in-fact and IRREVOCABLE PROXY to vote the Stock in
      any manner Morrison, on behalf of Pledgees, deems advisable for or
      against all matters submitted or which may be submitted to a vote of
      shareholders [and to exercise Byrum's rights under the Voting Agreement
      in any manner Morrison, on behalf of Pledgees, deems advisable].  The
      power of attorney granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall
      be irrevocable for so long as any of the Obligations remain unpaid.

            (b)  For so long as Pledgors shall have the right to vote the
      Stock, Pledgors covenant and agree that they will not, without the prior
      written consent of Morrison, vote or take any consensual action with
      respect to the Stock which would constitute a Default under or be
      inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.

      9.    Termination.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Agreement, and the security interest hereunder granted to
Pledgees in the Stock, shall terminate on the date on which all Obligations
of Pledgors to Pledgees under the Obligation Documents and any other agreement
have been fully satisfied.  Thereafter, upon written demand from Pledgors,
Pledgees, by their acceptance hereof, agree that they shall promptly release
the Stock by delivery of the Stock to Pledgors, unless and except to the
extent the Stock has been liquidated or otherwise disposed of pursuant to
Section 6 hereof.

      10.   Security Agreement.  This Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of
Alabama. 

      11.   General.

            (a)  Time is of the essence of this Agreement.  No waiver by
Pledgees of any power or right hereunder or of any Default by Pledgors
hereunder shall be binding upon Pledgees unless in writing signed by Pledgees. 
No failure or delay by Pledgees to exercise any power or right hereunder or
binding waiver of any Default hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any other
or further exercise of such power or any other Default.  This Agreement,
together all documents referred to herein, constitute the entire agreement
between Pledgors and Pledgees and may not be modified except by a writing
executed by Pledgees and delivered by Pledgees to Pledgors.

            (b)  If any paragraph or part thereof shall for any reason be
held or adjudged to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such paragraph or part thereof so adjudicated invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable shall be deemed separate, distinct, and independent,
and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall not be affected by such holding or adjudication.

            (c)  All representations and warranties made and given herein by
Pledgors shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall
remain in full force and effect until such time as this Agreement is
terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof.

            (d)  The rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall
inure to the benefit of and bind their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.

            (e)  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Alabama. 

            (f)  All notices and demands required or permitted hereunder or
by law shall be in writing or by telegraph and shall be mailed or delivered
to the party to whom notice is intended to be given at such address as is
specified below, or such other address as shall be subsequently designated in
writing by such party to the other party hereto for purposes of notice.

1. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
   Fiscal year 1994 marked the Company's third straight year of record
earnings and sales.  This progress was primarily achieved through the
expansion of the Company's Ruby Tuesday Group and the growth and improved
profitability of the Morrison Group.  The Company implemented a new
financial strategy in fiscal 1994 that focuses on the maintenance of a
targeted capital structure utilizing prudent amounts of debt to finance the
Company's expansion.  This new strategy seeks to maximize the economic
value returned on the capital invested in the Company and hence, maximize
stockholder value.  The contribution that each Group made to the Company's
progress in fiscal 1994 is discussed below.   
       
1.1  1994 Compared to 1993

Ruby Tuesday Group
   During fiscal 1994, the Company repositioned the former Silver Spoon
Cafe concept into Mozzarella's, an American cafe with an Italian accent. 
All data formerly reported under Silver Spoon Cafes is now reported under
the name Mozzarella's.      
   Sales and earnings increased in the Ruby Tuesday and Mozzarella's
concepts compared to fiscal 1993, while the L&N Seafood Grill concept
experienced sales and earnings declines.  Same-store sales for Ruby
Tuesdays and Mozzarella's increased in fiscal 1994, but decreased in the
L&N Seafood Grills.  The Group's newest concept, Sweetpea's, recorded sales
consistent with management's expectations during the fiscal year.  During
fiscal 1994, 42 Ruby Tuesdays, four Mozzarella's, one L&N Seafood Grill and
three Sweetpea's were opened.  There were four Ruby Tuesdays and five L&N
Seafood Grills closed during fiscal 1994.
   Operating profit increased 14.5% for the Group due to increased sales
offset by a 0.5% operating margin decrease.  The operating margin decrease
was the result of the shortfall in performance of the L&N Seafood Grills
and the development of the new Sweetpea's concept.  Excluding the results
of the L&N Seafood Grills, the Group's operating profit increased 25.8%. 
The Group's plans call for aggressive expansion of the Ruby Tuesday and
Mozzarella's concepts and limited expansion of the Sweetpea's concept in
fiscal 1995, both in the traditional Eastern U.S. markets and in new
markets in the Western U.S. The Company estimates that over 50 Ruby
Tuesdays and 10 other specialty restaurants will be opened in 1995.  In
addition, 30 of the 38 L&N Seafood Grills will be converted to other Ruby
Tuesday Group concepts (Ruby Tuesdays, Mozzarella's, or  Sweetpea's)
beginning in fiscal 1995. The remaining eight L&N Seafood Grills will be
sold or closed.

Morrison Group
   During fiscal 1994, the Company combined the former Hospitality Group,
which serves the contract dining market, with the Family Dining Group,
which serves the cafeteria market, to create the new Morrison Group.  The
contract dining sector of this Group was further broken down based on
market focus into a health care division for hospitals and health care
facilities and a hospitality division for schools, businesses and industry. 
All data formerly reported for the two separate Groups, Hospitality and
Family Dining, will be reported under the new Morrison Group.

                                            28
<PAGE>

   Sales in the Morrison Group increased 4.6% due to unit expansion in the
contract dining sector and an increase in the number of customers in the
family dining sector as a result of strategic price rollbacks and bundled-
meal promotions.  The Group opened 10 new family dining concepts during the
fiscal year, consisting of one small cafeteria and nine food-court quick-
service restaurants, as well as numerous contract dining accounts.  The
Group closed nine cafeterias during the fiscal year.  
   Operating profit increased 22.4% for the Group due to increased sales
and a 0.9% operating margin increase. The margin improvement resulted from
increased customers and food and labor cost controls.  
   The Company's plans call for continued growth of the Morrison Group
during fiscal 1995 due to the addition of approximately 30 Fresh Cooking
units, with expansion primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets. 
The Group's plans also call for accelerated growth in the health-care food-
service market.



Interest Expense (Income)
   Net interest expense decreased 83.9% during fiscal 1994 due to the
retirement of the Trust Company Bank note of $22.5 million during fiscal
1993 and increased capitalization of interest charges due to an increase in
the number of new units.

Income Tax Expense
   The effective income tax rate decreased to 37.2% in fiscal 1994 from
37.3% in fiscal 1993 due to the tax credit for FICA taxes paid on tips in
excess of the minimum wage commencing January, 1994 and also due to
increased levels of targeted jobs tax credit following the extension of the
program in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, offset by a 1%
increase in the corporate income tax rate, which went into effect January
1, 1993, and an increase in the effective state income tax rate.
        
1.2  1993 Compared to 1992

Results of Operations
   The Company achieved record earnings with its second year of over $1
billion in sales.  The increased sales and earnings represented continued
progress in the Company's efforts to expand operations, provide greater
value to customers, and control costs.  Despite the fact fiscal year 1993
had one less week of operations than fiscal year 1992, all operations
showed improvement in operating profits.  The contribution each Group made
to this growth is discussed below.

Ruby Tuesday Group
   Sales increased in all three Ruby Tuesday Group concepts compared to
fiscal 1992 due to new unit growth (31 Ruby Tuesdays, two L&N Seafood
Grills and five Mozzarella's).  Same-store sales for Ruby Tuesdays and
Mozzarella's increased in fiscal 1993 but decreased in the L&N Seafood
Grills division. 
   Operating profit increased 14.9% for the Group due to the increased
sales and a 0.1% operating margin increase.  The margin improvement
occurred in payroll and related costs due to cost controls that were
implemented during the year.
     
Morrison Group
   Sales in the Morrison Group increased 2.5% during fiscal year 1993 as a
result of growth in continuing and new units in the Group's Contract Dining
Division.  This increase was partially offset by sales decreases in the
Group's Family Dining Division due to the selective closing of three
cafeterias and a 52- week fiscal year 1993 versus a 53-week fiscal year
1992.  The Group engaged in various marketing strategies in its Family
Dining Division during the year, including menu changes, price rollbacks
and bundled-meal promotions, which led to increased customer counts.
   Operating profit for the Morrison Group increased 20.4% to $36.4
million.  Operating margin increased to 5.0%, up from 4.3% in the prior
year.  The margin increase is attributed to a decrease in bad debt and
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in the
Group's Contract Dining Division, and payroll and related cost decreases in
the Group's Family Dining Division.  The decrease in bad debt is related to
improved credit management, and the general and administrative savings are
related to tighter cost controls.   These decreases were partially offset
by an increase in cost of goods sold for the Group's Contract Dining
Division due to the addition of several large accounts which have higher
food costs than the average unit in the prior year, and an increase in
closing expenses associated with anticipated closings during fiscal 1994 in
the Group's Family Dining Division.  Operating units are constantly being
evaluated to determine their long-range profitability and value to the
Company.  
     

Interest Expense (Income)
   Net interest expense decreased 74.4% in fiscal 1993 due to the early
retirements of the $22.5 million Trust Company Bank note on December 16,
1992, and the $1.0 million Industrial Development Bond Lease on December 1,
1992.

                                            29
<PAGE>

Income Tax Expense
   The effective income tax rate increased to 37.3% in 1993 from 36.5% in
1992 due to increases in state income tax rates, decreases in non-taxable
interest generated from the Company's cash investments and a decrease in
targeted jobs tax credits.  The targeted jobs tax credit program expired
June 30, 1992, but was renewed retroactively to that date in the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, passed in August of 1993.   

2.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

2.1  Cash Flow from Operating Activities
   In fiscal 1994, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $92.7
million.  See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 37 for more
information.

2.2  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Facilities  
   The Company had lines of credit with various banks totaling $138 million
at June 4, 1994.  The Company utilized its lines of credit with various
financial institutions in fiscal 1994 to meet operational cash needs,
including stock repurchases.  The Company had unused lines of credit
totalling $120.6 million at June 4, 1994, of which $13.6 million were
committed and $107 million were non-committed.  The Company expects to fund
operations and capital expansion from operating cash flows as well as from
these lines of credit in fiscal 1995.  See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this report for a detailed discussion of short-term
borrowings and credit facilities.

2.3  Long-Term Debt
   Long-term debt decreased a net $3.6 million from the prior year due to
the first annual installment of the note payable to Life Insurance Company
of Georgia being due currently, and normally scheduled payments made during
the year, offset in part by the addition of a mortgage associated with the
purchase of a retail site.  The Company does not anticipate the need for
any additional long-term debt financing in fiscal year 1995.      

2.4  Working Capital
   Working capital and the current ratio as of June 4, 1994 were $(43.0)
million and 0.6, respectively.  The $44.9 million decrease in fiscal 1994
working capital is due to increased cash outlays for capital expenditures
and stock repurchases during the fiscal year.   

2.5  Capital Expenditures
   Property and equipment expenditures for fiscal 1994 were $90.3 million,
43.4% higher than the prior year.  During fiscal year 1994, 50 Ruby Tuesday
Group restaurants were opened compared to 55 budgeted openings and 10
Morrison's Fresh Cooking units were opened.  Capital expenditures for
fiscal 1995 are projected to be $116.6 million.  Projected openings for
fiscal year 1995 include in excess of 60 Ruby Tuesday Group restaurants and
approximately 30 Fresh Cooking units and family cafeteria-style
restaurants.  

2.6  Dividends
   Cash dividends paid to stockholders during fiscal 1994 equaled $11.9
million.  Management's financial strategy for the coming four years sets a
policy to increase dividends paid to stockholders by five percent annually,
based on the achievement of estimated earnings growth.  

2.7  Deferred Tax Assets
   The recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the anticipated
existence of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to
realize the assets.  A valuation allowance must be used to reduce the
deferred tax asset if such future income is not likely to be generated. 
Management believes that future taxable income should be sufficient to
realize all of the Company's deferred tax assets based on the historical
earnings of the Company, and therefore, a valuation allowance has not been
established.

3.  KNOWN EVENTS, UNCERTAINTIES AND TRENDS

3.1  Financial and Stock Repurchase Plans
   On March 30, 1994, the Board of Directors adopted a new financial
strategy that places more emphasis on debt management and establishes a
target capital structure which will utilize a prudent amount of debt to
minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing the Company to
maintain financial flexibility and the equivalent of an investment-grade
(BBB) bond rating.  The financial strategy sets a target debt-to-capital
ratio of 60%, including operating leases.  The plan also provides for
repurchasing Morrison stock whenever cash flow exceeds funding requirements
while maintaining the target capital structure.  Accordingly, the Board
approved the repurchase of up to an additional 2.5 million shares, bringing
the total authorized for repurchase to 4.6 million shares.  During fiscal
1994, the Company purchased 1,504,829 shares at a total purchase price of
$37.5 million under its various stock repurchase programs.

3.2  New Accounting Standards
  In November, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 - "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 112), which must be adopted
in fiscal year 1995.  SFAS 112 requires employers to recognize the cost of
benefits provided to former or inactive, but not retired, employees when an
event occurs indicating payment of benefits is probable and the cost can be
reasonably estimated.  If the benefits accumulate or vest, the cost must be
recognized over the active service period of the employee.
   The majority of the Company's postemployment benefits, including salary
continuation and health care and life insurance for disabled employees, do
not accumulate or vest and are currently recognized when benefits are paid
or funded.  The Company does not anticipate the effects of SFAS 112 to be
material.     
   In May, 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS No. 115), "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".  SFAS 115 revises the
accounting and reporting for all investments in debt securities and for
investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair
values.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS 115 no later than the
beginning of fiscal 1995.  Because of the issuance of SFAS 115, the Company
reevaluated its investment policies and, as a result, concluded that upon
the adoption of the statement, all of its equity securities would be
classified as available-for-sale and its only debt security would be
classified as held-to-maturity.  Application of the new rules will result
in an estimated increase of $200,000 to stockholders' equity, net of a
$100,000 tax effect, as of June 5, 1994, representing the recognition in
stockholders' equity of the unrealized appreciation that existed at June 4,
1994.
   In June, 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116 (SFAS 116), "Accounting for
Contributions Received and Contributions Made".  SFAS 116 requires that
unconditional contributions be recognized as expenses in the period in
which the promise is made rather than when the payment is made.  The
Company is required to adopt SFAS 116 no later than fiscal 1995.  The
Company does not anticipate the effects of SFAS 116 to be material.

3.3  Seasonality of Operations
   The quarterly operating results as well as certain current assets and
liabilities of the Morrison Group are affected by the traditional closings
of educational institutions during the summer months and their subsequent
reopenings at the beginning of September.

3.4  Impact of Inflation
   The Company has not experienced a significant overall impact from
inflation.  Although the impact of inflation on the cost of food, labor,
real estate and construction can significantly affect the Company's
operations, the Company can reduce this impact through increased menu
prices to the extent competitive pressures will permit.
       
3.5  Impact of Health Care Reform
   The Company is currently monitoring the health care reform proposals
being pursued by Congress.  Due to the labor-intensive nature of the
restaurant industry, any significant employer mandate to provide health
care benefits to all employees could have a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations, the amount of which is indeterminable at
this time.

3.6  Management's Outlook
   The Company has made many significant advances to position itself for
aggressive, strategic growth.  In the Ruby Tuesday Group, the Mozzarella's
concept will be one of the Company's growth vehicles.  The concept
specializes in pizzas, pastas, soups, salads and sandwiches, with a $9
average check.  Sweetpea's, with classic American food, will serve as a
test vehicle specializing in rotisserie chicken,  vegetables, soups and
salads, with an $8 average check.  Ruby Tuesday, with burgers, ribs,
fajitas, chicken, soups, salads and sandwiches, will maintain its
aggressive posture.  Thirty of the 38 L&N Seafood Grills will be converted
to other Morrison concepts(Ruby Tuesdays, Mozzarella's Cafes or
Sweetpea's).  Also, the agreement entered into with Tia's offers the
Company an attractive opportunity to enter the Tex-Mex dining segment. 
Management believes that it is positioned to take advantage of growth
opportunities well into the future.
   In the Morrison Group,  the sale of the education, business and industry
contracts, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, will allow the Company to focus on its leadership position in
the health-care segment of the   contract business.  The Group's Family
Dining Division has begun expansion of its Morrison's Fresh Cooking concept
which specializes in home-meal replacement, highlighting fresh, wholesome
chicken and vegetables served primarily in food-courts but also in free-
standing and strip-center locations.  The existing cafeterias have returned
to a position of strong positive sales and earnings.
   The sale of the education, business and industry contracts and the
phasing out of the L&N Seafood Grills (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) are part of the Company's strategy to invest in high-
growth businesses that have or can attain a dominant market position in
their respective categories.  Morrison will focus on accelerating the
growth of its proven concepts in the Ruby Tuesday Group (Ruby Tuesday and
Mozzarella's) and in the Morrison Group (Fresh Cooking and Health Care). 
Management believes that this realignment will strategically position the
Company to attain its growth and profitability objectives of creating value
for its stockholders, its customers and its employees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MORRISON RESTAURANTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

June 4, 1994

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Morrison Restaurants Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.
   Fiscal Year - The Company's fiscal year ends on the first Saturday after
May 30.  The fiscal years ended June 4, 1994, June 5, 1993, and June 6,
1992 were comprised of 52, 52, and 53 weeks, respectively.
   Inventories - Inventories consist of materials, food supplies, china and
silver and are stated at the lower of cost (first in-first out) or market.
   Property and Equipment and Depreciation - Expenditures for replacements
and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred.  The cost of assets sold or retired and the related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
is recognized.
   Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for
capital lease property, over the term of the lease, if shorter.  Annual
rates of depreciation range from 3% to 5% for buildings and from 8% to 34%
for restaurant and other equipment.
   Income Taxes - The Company changed its method of accounting for income
taxes in fiscal year 1993 by adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109.  Deferred income taxes are determined utilizing a
liability approach.  This method gives consideration to the future tax
consequences associated with differences between financial accounting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Certain prior year balance sheet
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Such reclassifications had no impact on working capital or stockholders'
equity.  Additional information regarding this statement is presented in
Note 4.  For the fiscal year ended June 6, 1992, the Company provided
deferred income taxes to recognize the effect of timing differences between
financial and tax reporting. Tax credits are utilized to reduce income tax
expense in the year such credits are available.  
   Pre-Opening Expenses - Salaries, personnel training costs and other
expenses of opening new facilities are charged to expense as incurred.
   Earnings Per Share - Earnings per share are based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during each year and are adjusted for
the assumed conversion of shares issuable upon exercise of options, after
the assumed repurchase of common shares with the related proceeds and after
the adjustment for the stock splits and stock dividends through June 4,
1994.  The difference between the primary and fully diluted earnings per
share amounts shows the maximum extent of potential dilution of current
earnings that conversions of shares could create.  
   Intangible Assets - Excess of costs over the fair value of net assets
acquired of purchased businesses generally is amortized on a straight-line
basis over 40 years.  The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed if facts
and circumstances suggest that it may be impaired.  At June 4, 1994 and
June 5, 1993, accumulated amortization for costs in excess of net assets
acquired was $6,736,000 and $5,967,000, respectively.   Other intangibles
are amortized over their specified lives, varying from five to 20 years. 
For the years ending June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, accumulated
amortization for other intangibles was $4,394,000 and $4,120,000,
respectively.
   Postretirement Benefits - In fiscal year 1993, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions". 
The statement requires accrual of estimated cost of retiree benefit
payments during the years that the employees render service.  Prior to
1993, the Company expensed these benefits as paid.  

2. BUSINESS SEGMENT
   The Company operates exclusively in the foodservice industry.  During
fiscal 1994, the Company was organized into two, rather than three, operating
groups.  The Company's two groups are:
   Ruby Tuesday Group - consists of Ruby Tuesdays, Mozzarella's Cafes, Silver
Spoon Cafes, L&N Seafood Grills, and Sweetpea's, America's Good Eats.
   Morrison Group - comprised of Morrison's Cafeterias, Sadie's Buffets and
Grills, Morrison's Fresh Cooking, and contract food service accounts.  For
fiscal year 1994, contract food services consisted of health care (60%),
education (19%), and business and industry (21%). 
   Operating Profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated
general and administrative expenses, net interest expense (income) and income
taxes.
   Corporate assets consist primarily of cash (including short-term
investments) and certain property, including the administrative headquarters.
   Financial data with respect to the Company's Groups is presented on page
33.

3. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
   In fiscal 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" (SFAS 106).  The Company provides
health care benefits to substantially all retired employees and life insurance
benefits to certain retirees.  Benefits are funded as medical claims and life

                                            38

<PAGE>
insurance premiums are incurred.  Retirees become eligible for retirement
benefits if they meet certain service and minimum age requirements. This
statement requires accrual of these postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits during the years an employee provides services.  The total
postretirement benefit costs for fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993 were $548,000 and
$407,000, respectively.  Prior to fiscal 1993, the expense for these benefits
was recognized as paid.  As of June 7, 1992, the cumulative effect of adopting
SFAS 106, which is reported separately in the consolidated statement of income
for the fiscal year ended June 5, 1993, resulted in a charge of $2,579,000,
or $0.07 per share, which is net of a tax benefit of $1,594,000. 

   The actuarial present value of accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations and the amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance
sheets at June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993 are as follows:

June 5, 1993, was as follows:

Postretirement benefit cost                                 $  548   $ 407  
</TABLE>
   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 0% because the Company's
plan calls for a level future contribution by the employer.  Measurement of
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was based on an assumed
7.5% discount rate for fiscal 1994 and 9.5% for 1993. 
4. INCOME TAXES 

   Provisions for income taxes were calculated according to the precepts of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS
109) in fiscal years 1994 and 1993 and according to Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 11 in fiscal 1992.  The Company adopted SFAS 109
effective June 7, 1992, the first day of fiscal year 1993.  SFAS 109
required a change from the deferred to the liability method of computing
deferred income taxes.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle increased fiscal 1993 net income by $2,395,000, or $0.06 per
share, and is reported separately in the consolidated statement of income
for the fiscal year ended June 5, 1993.  The impact of the 1% increase in
the top marginal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 35% effective
January 1, 1993 on the provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of
the Company was immaterial.

   The components of income tax expense attributable to operations for the
years ended June 4, 1994, June 5, 1993, and June 6, 1992, are as follows:

5.  CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
   The Company's cash management program provides for the investment of
excess cash balances in short-term money market instruments.  Short-term
investments at June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, of approximately $966,000 and
$25,786,000, respectively, consisted primarily of tax exempt short-term
securities.  Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates
market.  The Company considers cash on hand at restaurants, deposits in
banks, and short-term marketable securities with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash and short-term investments. 

6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
   The accompanying table provides disclosure of the estimated fair value
of the Company's financial instruments, presented in accordance with the
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS
107) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The disclosures
include all financial instruments other than specified items such as
leases, subsidiary investments, and pension and benefit obligations.  The
disclosures also exclude the effect of taxes and other expenses that would
be incurred in a market transaction.

Cash and short-term investments:
   The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and short-
term investments approximates fair value.

Notes receivable:
   The fair value of the Company's notes receivable is based on expected
future cash flows discounted at market interest rates.

Short-term borrowings:
   The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for short-term
borrowings approximates fair value.

Long-term debt:
   The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based on the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates
offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.

   The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's
financial instruments at June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993 are as follows:

7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
   Salary Deferral Plan - Under the Morrison Restaurants Inc. Salary
Deferral Plan each eligible employee, as defined in the Plan, may elect to
make pre-tax contributions to a trust fund in amounts ranging from 2% to
10% of their annual earnings.  Employees contributing a pre-tax
contribution of at least 2% may elect to make after-tax contributions not
in excess of 10% of annual earnings.  The Company contribution to the Plan
is based on the employee's pre-tax contribution and years of service. 
After three years of service the Company contributes 20% of the employee's
pre-tax contribution, 30% after 10 years of service and 40% after 20 years
of service.  Normally, the full amount of each participant's interest in
the trust fund is paid upon retirement or total disability.  However, the
Plan allows participants to make early withdrawals of pre-tax and after-tax
contributions, subject to certain restrictions.  The Plan may be terminated
by the Company at any time.  The Company's contributions to the trust fund
approximated $711,000, $692,000, and $586,000 for 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.
   Deferred Compensation Plan - The Company maintains the Morrison
Restaurants Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for certain selected employees. 
The provisions of this non-qualified Plan are similar to those of the
Salary Deferral Plan except for the employees who are eligible to
participate.  The Company's contributions under the Plan approximated
$483,000, $502,000, and $413,000 for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. 
Assets of the Plan are held by a rabbi trust.  Under current accounting
rules, assets of a rabbi trust must be accounted for as if they are assets
of the Company, therefore, all earnings and expenses are recorded in the
Company's financial statements.  The net of the rabbi trust's earnings and
losses is recorded as additional liability to the participants and is
considered to be interest expense to the Company.  The Company recorded
$566,000, $457,000, and $462,000 interest expense for this Plan in 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively.  Assets of the Plan approximated $13,083,000
and $10,019,000 in 1994 and 1993 and includes $5,517,000 and $3,212,000 of
Morrison Restaurants Inc. Common Stock which is accounted for as treasury
stock.

                                            41 
<PAGE>
   Retirement Plan -  Effective December 31, 1987, the Morrison Restaurants
Inc. Retirement Plan was amended so that no additional benefits will accrue
and no new participants will enter the Plan after that date.  Participants
will receive benefits based upon salary and length of service.  The Company
contributed $2,622,000 to the Plan in 1992.  No contribution was made in
1994 or 1993.  The Company recorded income of $95,000 in 1994 and $79,000
in 1993 but recognized net pension expense in 1992 of $141,000.
   Executive Supplemental Pension Plan -  Under the unfunded Executive
Supplemental Pension Plan, selected employees become eligible to receive
supplemental retirement payments based upon salary and length of service,
reduced by social security benefits and amounts otherwise receivable under
the Retirement Plan.  Expenses under the Plan approximated $905,000,
$717,000, and $689,000 for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.
   Management Retirement Plan - Under the unfunded Morrison Restaurants
Inc. Management Retirement Plan, individuals actively employed by the
Company as of June 1, 1989, or thereafter, who have 15 years of credited
service and whose average annual compensation for the immediately preceding
three calendar years equalled or exceeded $40,000, become participants. 
Participants will receive benefits based upon salary and length of service,
reduced by social security benefits and benefits payable under the
Retirement Plan and Executive Supplemental Pension Plan.  Expenses
recognized approximated $492,000, $294,000, and $256,000 in 1994, 1993, and
1992, respectively.

   To provide a funding source for the payments of benefits under the
Executive Supplemental Pension Plan and the Management Retirement Pension
Plan, the Company owns whole-life insurance contracts on some of the
participants.  The to-date cash value of these policies net of policy loans
is $2,462,000.  The Company has established a rabbi trust to hold the
policies and death benefits as they are received.
   The following table details the components of pension expense, the
funded status and amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated

   At June 4, 1994, land and buildings with a book value of approximately
$1,670,000 collateralized the various obligations.
   Under various financing agreements, the Company has agreed to certain
restrictions on the incurring of additional indebtedness and to certain
minimum consolidated working capital and net worth requirements.  In
addition, the Company has agreed to restrict dividend payments (other than
stock dividends) and purchases of its capital stock to amounts based on
earnings after fiscal year 1990.  At June 4, 1994, retained earnings in the
amount of $2,146,000 were available for distribution.  
   At June 4, 1994, the Company had committed lines of credit amounting to
$31,000,000 and non-committed lines of credit amounting to $107,000,000
with various banks at various interest rates.  These lines are subject to
periodic review by each bank and may be canceled by the Company at any
time.  The Company utilized its lines of credit to meet operational cash
needs during fiscal 1994.  During fiscal 1994, borrowings on these lines of
credit reached a period-end maximum of $17,416,000.  There were no short-
term borrowings during fiscal year 1993.     
   At June 4, 1994, the Company was contingently liable for approximately
$33,912,000 in letters of credit, issued primarily in connection with its

property and equipment amounted to approximately $1,049,000 and $646,000
for the years ended June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, respectively.
   At June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, long-term debt amounts of $1,800,000
and $2,100,000, respectively, are considered extinguished in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 76 concerning
in-substance defeasance of corporate debt.  U. S. Treasury Bills and cash
have been placed in an irrevocable trust to satisfy scheduled payments of
both interest and principal on these defeased obligations.

9.  LEASES
   Various operations of the Company are conducted in leased premises. 
Initial lease terms expire at various dates over the next 23 years and may
provide for escalation of rent during the lease term.  Most of these leases
provide for additional contingent rents based upon sales volume and contain
options to renew (at adjusted rentals for some leases).  The administrative
headquarters has a lease term ending in 1998 and provides an option to
purchase at a nominal amount at the end of the initial lease term.  
   Assets recorded under capital leases at June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993
(included in Property and Equipment in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets) are as follows:

10. PREFERRED STOCK
   Under its Certificate of Incorporation the Company is authorized to
issue preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 in an amount not to exceed
250,000 shares which may be divided into and issued in designated series,
with dividend rates, rights of conversion, redemption, liquidation prices
and other terms or conditions as determined by the Board of Directors.  No
preferred shares have been issued as of June 4, 1994.  The Board of
Directors has designated 50,000 of such shares as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock and has issued rights to acquire such shares,
upon certain events, with an exercise price of $75.00 per one one-
thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment.  The rights expire on April
9, 1997, and may be redeemed prior to 10 days after the acquisition of 20%
or more of the Company's common stock.

11.  CAPITAL STOCK, OPTIONS, AND BONUS PLANS
   The Morrison Restaurants Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan -- Under this
Plan, options and performance units were granted to key employees.  The
Plan was effective from September 24, 1984, until May 27, 1989.  The
exercise price of stock options granted was not less than the fair market
value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  All options are
currently exercisable and expire 10 years and one day from the date of
grant.  At June 4, 1994, the Company had reserved 50,000 shares of common
stock for the Morrison Restaurants Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan.  

   The Morrison Restaurants Inc. 1987 Stock Bonus and Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan -- This Plan was effective from November 30, 1986 until
November 30, 1992.  A Committee appointed by the Board determined the
employees who were eligible to participate in this Plan.  Based on a
participant's cash bonus amount receivable under the Company's cash bonus
plans, the Committee determined the number of shares of the Company's
common stock the participant could purchase under this Plan.  Each
participant who elected to purchase shares of the Company's common stock
received additional shares of stock equal to 15% of the shares purchased. 
The shares purchased (including bonus shares) generally may not be sold,
transferred or pledged for three years after the date on which they were
received by the participant.  Each participant who so elected was also
granted an option to purchase shares of common stock in an amount generally
equal to three times the number of bonus shares issued.  The price for the
stock and stock options was the fair market value of the common stock on
the date set by the Committee.  Stock options generally may not be
exercised until five years have lapsed from the date of grant, and the
options expire 10 years and one day from the date of grant.  No stock was
issued under the Plan during 1994.  At June 4, 1994, the Company had
reserved 1,192,000 shares of common stock for this Plan.

                                            44

   The Morrison Restaurants Inc. Stock Incentive Plan -- In September 1992,
the shareholders approved The Morrison Restaurants Inc. Stock Incentive
Plan which is an amendment and restatement of The Morrison Restaurants Inc.
1989 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.  A Committee, appointed by the Board,
administers the Plan on behalf of the Company and has complete discretion
to determine participants and the terms and provisions of Stock Incentives,
subject to the Plan.  The Incentive Plan permits the Committee to make
awards of shares of common stock, awards of derivative securities related
to the value of the common stock, and certain cash awards to eligible
persons.  These discretionary awards may be made on an individual basis or
pursuant to a program approved by the Committee for the benefit of a group
of eligible persons.  The Incentive Plan permits the Committee to make
awards of a variety of stock incentives, including (but not limited to)
dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, performance unit awards, phantom shares, stock appreciation rights
and stock awards.  During 1994, 21,000 shares were issued under the Plan. 
At June 4, 1994, the Company had reserved a total of 1,304,000 shares of
common stock for this Plan.

   The Morrison Restaurants Inc. Stock Incentive and Deferred Compensation
Plan for Directors -- In September 1992, the shareholders approved the
Morrison Restaurants Inc. Stock Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan
for Directors, which is an amendment and restatement of the Morrison
Restaurants Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors.  The Company
previously had no plan permitting equity-based awards to its non-management
directors.  The Directors' Plan permits each non-management director to
purchase options to purchase shares of common stock with all or a portion
of his or her retainer, in 25% increments, other than any portion of the
retainer deferred to his or her deferred compensation account.  Any option
issued under the Plan is granted once each year on the date of the annual
meeting of the stockholders.  Each option is exercisable in full upon the
earliest of (i) the first anniversary of the date the option was granted,
(ii) the date the optionee ceases to be a director on account of death,
disability or after attaining age 70, or (iii) the date of a change in
control.  Each option is exercisable at a price equal to one-half of the
per share closing sale price of the common stock on the last trading day
immediately prior to the date that option is awarded.  The number of shares
of common stock subject to each option will be equal to the amount of a
director's retainer used to purchase options divided by the option exercise
price.  Once exercisable, each option remains exercisable for 10 years from
the date of grant.  In association with this Plan, a one-time restricted
stock award was made, in fiscal 1993, to each of the Company's existing
non-management directors, totaling 16,000 shares. A Committee, appointed by
the Board, administers the Plan on behalf of the Company.  At June 4, 1994,
the Company had reserved 207,000 shares of common stock for the Directors'
Plan.

   The Morrison Restaurants Inc. 1993 Non-Executive Stock Incentive Plan --
In October 1993, the Board of Directors approved the Morrison Restaurants
Inc. 1993 Non-Executive Stock Incentive Plan.  A Committee, appointed by
the Board, administers the Plan on behalf of the Company and has full
authority in its discretion to determine the officers and key employees to
whom Stock Incentives are granted and the terms and provisions of Stock
Incentives, subject to the Plan.  During 1994, 90,000 shares were issued
under the Plan.   At June 4, 1994, the Company had reserved a total of
1,410000 shares of common stock for this Plan.

option plans:

   On August 8, 1994, the Company sold certain education, business and
industry (B&I) contracts and assets of the Morrison Group to Gardner
Merchant Food Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Gardner Merchant
Ltd., for a cash payment of $100 million.  The Company will close the
remaining B&I accounts .  The sale of the B&I accounts and the
discontinuance of the remaining accounts is expected to result in a net
pre-tax gain of approximately $35 million.  Sales from B&I contracts in 32
states and Washington, D.C., in fiscal year 1994 were $249.9 million, with
operating profits of $7.3 million.   

   At its June 27, 1994 meeting, the Company's Board of Directors approved
the plan to  phase out its L&N Seafood Grills concept by converting 30 of
38 units into Ruby Tuesdays, Mozzarella's Cafes, or Sweetpea's Restaurants,
and by selling or closing the remaining L&N locations.  The cost of the
conversions and closings is estimated to approximate $19.7 million and will
be reserved for in the first quarter of fiscal year 1995.  Sales for the
L&N concept in fiscal year 1994 were $63.3 million with negligible results.

publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RI.
Prior to that, it was traded over-the-counter under the NASDAQ-NMS Symbol

downs, and neither the NYSE nor over-the-counter quotations include
commissions, hence they may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Stockholders and Board of Directors
Morrison Restaurants Inc. and Subsidiaries

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morrison
Restaurants Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 4, 1994 and June 5, 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 4,
1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.      
   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Morrison Restaurants Inc. and Subsidiaries at June 4, 1994 and June 5,
1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 4, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   Morrison Restaurants Inc. has prepared the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles appropriate in the circumstances.  They necessarily include some
amounts that are based on estimates and judgments as to the expected
effects of incomplete events and transactions.
   In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial
statements, the Company maintains and relies on a system of internal
controls.  This system is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance at appropriate cost that assets are safeguarded and transactions
are recorded properly.  It is augmented by written policies and procedures;
an organizational structure which provides for division of responsibilities
where appropriate in the circumstances; training and development of
managers in financial and other functional areas; and evaluation by
independent auditors during their audit of the financial statements.
   The Board of Directors of Morrison Restaurants Inc. pursues its
oversight role with respect to the Company's financial statements through
an Audit Committee.  This Committee meets periodically during the year with
management personnel and the independent auditors to review the activity of
each, to consider audit results, and to discuss internal accounting
control, auditing, and financial reporting matters.  The independent
auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time
without the presence of management.
