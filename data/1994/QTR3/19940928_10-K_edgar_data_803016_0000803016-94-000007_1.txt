ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

      Amplicon  leases  and sells mid-range computers, peripherals,  work
stations,   personal  computer  networks,  telecommunications  equipment,
computer  automated design and manufacturing equipment, office automation
equipment,  computer  software and other items of  personal  property  to
customers   located  throughout  the  United  States.  The  Company   was
incorporated  in  California  in  1977.  Unless  the  context   otherwise
requires,  the  terms "Amplicon" and "Company" as used  herein  refer  to
Amplicon, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

      Mid-Range Computers and Computer Networks. The Company concentrates
on  the  market for mid-range computers and computer networks since  this
market  is particularly receptive to leasing services. A growing  portion
of  the  Company's business consists of personal computers, workstations,
printers, and software which are integrated into complete networks.  Mid-
range computers generally cost between $100,000 and $750,000 and are used
primarily  by subsidiaries and divisions of large companies to supplement
mainframe  computer systems, by middle-market companies  for  centralized
data  processing,  and to upgrade personal computer  networks.  Mid-range
computer systems typically consist of a central processing unit, multiple
display   terminals,  printers,  disk  and  tape  drives,  communications
equipment and operating software.  Computer networks typically consist of
a  central  server,  which  may  be  a  mid-range  computer  or  high-end
microcomputer,  multiple  personal computers  and  workstations,  network
communications  hardware and software, printers and  associated  products
for  microcomputer based networks.  Computer networks generally range  in
cost from $100,000 to $3,000,000.

      Mid  range  systems and computer networks are modular  and  can  be
expanded  to satisfy additional data processing requirements and  perform
additional  functions  by upgrading the central  processing  unit  and/or
server,  and  adding  data  storage devices and workstations  to  support
additional  users.  Advances in microcomputer technology and enhancements
to  the  capabilities  of  mid-range computer systems  have  led  to  the
development of systems that  better integrate data processing  with  word
processing, file and retrieval systems, and electronic mail. The  Company
leases  and  sells mid-range computer systems manufactured  primarily  by
International  Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"),  Digital  Equipment
Corporation ("DEC"), and Hewlett-Packard Co. ("HP").  Vendors of computer
network  products  include IBM and HP, as well as AST  Research,  Compaq,
Gateway,  among many others, and software vendors such as  Microsoft  and
Novell.

      Other  Electronic  Equipment. Advances in microcomputer  technology
have  also  expanded the scope of other electronic equipment utilized  by
Amplicon's  existing  and targeted customer base.   Amplicon  leases  and
sells   telecommunications  equipment,  computer  automated  design   and
computer  automated  manufacturing  ("CAD/"CAM")  equipment,  and  office
automation  equipment.  The telecommunications equipment  leased  by  the
Company consists primarily of digital private branch equipment, switching
equipment  and  voice mail systems manufactured by American  Telephone  &
Telegraph  Company,  Rolm  Corporation  and  International  Telephone   &
Telegraph  Company and generally costs between $50,000 and $500,000.  The
CAD/CAM  systems  leased by the Company include those  produced  by  IBM,
Hewlett Packard, and Sun Microsystems, Inc. and cost between $50,000  and
$700,000  per  system. The Company also leases word  processing  systems,
copying  equipment,  retail point of sale equipment  and  bank  automatic
teller machines.

      Production Equipment and Other Personal Property.  The  Company  is
leasing  an  increasing  amount of technology related  manufacturing  and
production  management systems.  These systems include  complex  computer
controlled  manufacturing  equipment,  printing  presses  and   warehouse
distribution systems.  In addition, the Company leases a wide variety  of
personal   property   in  the  "non-high  technology"   area,   including
manufacturing equipment, trucks and office furniture.

       Software.    Amplicon  leases  specialized  application   software
packages.  These  application software packages  typically  cost  between
$50,000  and  $500,000.   In  addition to  leasing  stand-alone  software
packages,  an  increasing percentage of the cost  of  mid-range  computer
systems and networks consists of operating and application software.

                     AMPLICON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                    
Marketing Strategy

      The  Company  has  developed and refined a direct marketing  system
utilizing  a  centralized telemarketing program. The program  includes  a
system  which creates and maintains a data base of current and  potential
users  of  personal property, a comprehensive formal training program  to
introduce new marketing employees to Amplicon's telemarketing techniques,
and an in-house computer and telecommunications system.

      The  Company implemented its current marketing system in 1981 after
having determined that a centralized telemarketing program would be  more
cost  effective  than the field sales representatives it  had  previously
used  to  conduct  its  marketing activities. The  use  of  telemarketing
techniques  rather  than  field  sales representatives  has  enabled  the
Company  to limit selling, general and administrative expenses  to  seven
percent  (7%)  or  less of revenues during each of its last  five  fiscal
years  and,  consequently, allows the Company to offer  more  competitive
rates to its customers.

      Amplicon  identifies  potential  customers  through  a  variety  of
methods.  The  Company  purchases lists of computer  users  from  private
sources,  conducts direct mail and telephone campaigns to generate  sales
leads, and maintains records of contacts made with potential customers by
its  account executives. In 1991, Amplicon installed a personal  computer
network  and  customized software to further enhance the productivity  of
the  sales  force.  Specific  information about  potential  customers  is
entered  into  an on-line data base accessible to each account  executive
through  the  personal  computer  network.  As  potential  customers  are
contacted by account executives, the database is updated and supplemented
with  information about what computer and other equipment they are using,
related  lease  expiration  dates  and  any  future  equipment  needs  or
replacement  plans. The data base allows account executives  to  identify
efficiently  the  most likely purchaser or lessee  of  equipment  and  to
concentrate efforts on these prospective customers.

      Amplicon's data base, combined with the telemarketing software, and
an  integrated  in-house telecommunications system, permit the  Company's
sales  management to monitor account executive activity,  daily  prospect
status  and pricing information. The ability to monitor account  activity
and  offer  immediate assistance in negotiating or pricing a  transaction
makes  it  possible  for Amplicon to be responsive to its  customers  and
potential customers.

Leasing and Sales Activities

      The  Company's leases are generally for terms ranging from  two  to
five  years.  All of the Company's leases are noncancelable "net"  leases
which contain "hell-or-high-water" provisions under which the lessee must
make  all lease payments regardless of any defects in the equipment,  and
which  require  the lessee to maintain and service the equipment,  insure
the equipment against casualty loss and pay all property, sales and other
taxes on the equipment. The Company retains ownership of the equipment it
leases,  and  in the event of default by the lessee, the Company  or  the
lender  to  whom the lease had been assigned may declare  the  lessee  in
default,  accelerate all lease payments due under the  lease  and  pursue
other  available remedies, including repossession of the equipment.  Upon
the  expiration of the leases, the lessee typically has an option,  which
is  dependent  upon each lease's defined end of term options,  to  either
purchase the equipment at a mutually agreeable price, or in the case of a
"conditional  sales contract", at a predetermined minimum  price,  or  to
renew  the lease. If the purchase option is not exercised by the original
lessee,  once the equipment is returned to the Company, the Company  will
endeavor  to  locate a new lessee -- however, if a new lessee  cannot  be
located then the Company seeks to sell the equipment.  The terms  of  the
Company's  software  leases are substantially similar  to  its  equipment
leases.

Leasing and Sales Activities (Continued)

      The  Company conducts its leasing business in a manner designed  to
conserve  its  working  capital and minimize  its  credit  exposure.  The
Company does not purchase equipment until it has received a noncancelable
lease from its customer and, generally, has determined that the lease can
be  discounted  with  a bank or financial institution  on  a  nonrecourse
basis.  Accordingly,  a substantial portion of the Company's  leases  are
discounted to banks or finance companies on a nonrecourse basis at  fixed
interest   rates   that  reflect  the  customers'  financial   condition.
Approximately  91.4% and 83.6% of the total dollar amount of  new  leases
entered  into by the Company during the fiscal years ended June 30,  1994
and  1993,  respectively, were discounted to financial institutions.  The
lender  to  which a lease has been assigned has no recourse  against  the
Company,  unless  the  Company  is in default  of  the  terms  under  the
agreement  by  which a lease was assigned to the lender.  The  lender  to
which a lease has been assigned may take title to the leased equipment in
the  event  the lessee fails to make lease payments or initiates  certain
other  defaults under the terms of the lease. If this occurs, the Company
may not realize its residual investment in the leased equipment.
                                    
      From  time  to  time, the Company invests cash generated  from  its
activities into lease transactions  meeting credit standards set  by  the
Company.  Some of these transactions are entered into when the  value  of
the underlying property, or the credit rating of the lessee, would not be
acceptable  to  a  financial  institution  for  purposes  of   making   a
nonrecourse loan to the Company. Each of these transactions must meet  or
exceed  certain profitability requirements as established, on a  case  by
case  basis,  by  the  Company's executive management.  In  addition  the
Company invests in lease transactions which the Company believes could be
placed  at a later date to nonrecourse lenders on a lease by lease  basis
or in a portfolio debt placement or securitization. During the year ended
June  30,  1994,  the  Company completed three debt placements  of  lease
receivable  portfolios accumulated under such investment  guidelines  for
aggregate  cash proceeds of $23,406,774. At June 30, 1994 and  1993,  the
discounted   minimum  lease  payments  receivable  relative   to   leases
maintained  in  the  Company's  portfolio  amounted  to  $31,123,678  and
$31,052,728, respectively.
                                    
Customers

      The Company's customers are primarily subsidiaries and divisions of
Fortune  1000  companies and middle-market companies with credit  ratings
acceptable  to the lenders providing nonrecourse loans. The Company  does
not  believe  that  the loss of any one customer would  have  a  material
adverse effect on its operations taken as a whole.

Competition

     The Company competes in the distribution and lease financing of mid-
range  computer equipment and software and other equipment with equipment
brokers  and  dealers,  leasing  companies,  banks  and  other  financial
institutions and credit corporations which are affiliated with  equipment
manufacturers, such as, IBM, DEC and HP. The Company believes that  there
is  increased  competition for new business and that such competition  is
heightened  during  periods  when key vendors introduce  significant  new
products. Changes by the manufacturers of equipment leased by the Company
with  respect  to  pricing,  maintenance  or  marketing  practices  could
materially  affect  the  Company.  In addition,  if  credit  corporations
affiliated with manufacturers become more aggressive with respect to  the
financing  terms  offered, the Company's operations  could  be  adversely
affected.  Many  of the Company's competitors have substantially  greater
resources,  capital, and more extensive and diversified  operations  than
Amplicon. The Company believes the principal competitive factors  in  the
industry  which  it serves are price, responsiveness to  customer  needs,
flexibility  in  structuring financing arrangements, financial  technical
proficiency and the offering of a broad range of financial options.

Employees

      The Company, as of June 30, 1994, had 196 employees, including  125
sales  managers  and account executives and 15 professionals  engaged  in
finance and credit. None of the Company's employees is represented  by  a
labor  union. The Company believes that its relations with its  employees
are satisfactory.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     At June 30, 1994, Amplicon occupied approximately 27,000 square feet
of  office  space  in  Santa  Ana, California  leased  from  unaffiliated
parties.  The  lease  covering the majority of  the  space  provides  for
monthly  rental  payments which average $30,377  from  inception  through
January 1998.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is sometimes named as a defendant in litigation relating
to  the  services it provides. Management does not expect the outcome  of
any  existing  suit to have a material adverse effect  on  the  Company's
financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1994 and 1993

      REVENUES.  Total revenues for the fiscal year ended June  30,  1994
were  $181,360,291, an increase of $17,532,061 or 10.7%  from  the  prior
year.  This  change  was primarily the result of increases  in  sales  of
equipment of $17,355,868 and interest income of $660,362 offset by  lower
rental income of $484,169. The Company believes the increase in sales  of
equipment  was primarily due to increased effectiveness of a  larger  and
more  experienced salesforce at obtaining new business.  Interest  income
for  the  fiscal  year ended June 30, 1994 increased  to  $24,356,893  as
compared  to  $23,696,531  for  the fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  1993,
partially  due  to  higher  interest income on discounted  lease  rentals
assigned  to  lenders (which is offset by interest expense on nonrecourse
debt)  of  $11,659,414  in the fiscal year ended  June  30,  1994  versus
$11,452,119 for the prior year.

      Net  interest  income  (interest income less  interest  expense  on
discounted  lease rentals assigned to lenders) for the fiscal year  ended
June 30, 1994 increased by $453,067 or 3.7% to $12,697,479 as compared to
$12,244,412  for  fiscal  year ended June 30,  1993.  This  net  increase
resulted  primarily  from  higher amortization  of  deferred  income  and
increases in interest accretion due to a larger residual value base.

      Rental  income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 of  $263,060
decreased by $484,169 or 64.8% as compared to the fiscal year ended  June
30,  1993,  as  a  result of decreases in the volume of short-term  lease
renewals.
                                    
      GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 30,  1994
increased by $3,370,357, or 12.9%, to $29,453,424 compared to $26,083,067
for  the  fiscal year ended June 30, 1993. Gross profit as a  percent  of
total  revenues  increased  to 16.2% of total revenues  for  fiscal  1994
compared to 15.9% of total revenues for the prior year. Additionally, the
cost of equipment sold as a percentage of sales of equipment decreased to
90.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 versus 91.1% for the fiscal
year  ended  June  30, 1993. The principal factors which  contributed  to
higher  gross  profit  were increased profits  from  lease  renewals  and
extensions, sales of equipment at the end of the lease term and increases
in net interest income as described above.

      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general  and
administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  6.6%  for
the  fiscal  year ended June 30, 1994 as compared to 6.5% for the  fiscal
year  ended  June 30, 1993. Selling, general and administrative  expenses
for  the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 increased by $1,354,840 or 12.8%
as  compared  to  the prior year. This increase resulted  primarily  from
higher  sales  and finance staff personnel costs, higher variable  office
costs  related to the greater business volume and additions made  to  the
management organization to support future growth.

      INTEREST EXPENSE-OTHER. Interest expense-other was $174,059 for the
year  ended June 30, 1994 as compared to $89,067 for the year ended  June
30,  1993.  The  increase of $84,992 is primarily the result  of  greater
fiscal  year  1994 interest assessments made as the result of  regulatory
audits with various federal, state and local agencies.

      TAXES.  The Company's tax rate was 36.5% for both the fiscal  years
ended  June 30, 1994 and 1993 representing its estimated annual tax rates
for  the  years ending June 30, 1994 and 1993.  The Company expects  that
its  tax rate for fiscal years beginning after July 1, 1994 will increase
to  reflect,  as applicable, changes in the Federal statutory  tax  rate,
various State tax rates and the expiration of certain tax benefits.

Results of Operations (continued)

Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1993 and 1992

      REVENUES.  Total revenues for the fiscal year ended June  30,  1993
were  $163,828,230, an increase of $33,388,084 or 25.6%  from  the  prior
year.  This  change  was primarily the result of increases  in  sales  of
equipment  of $35,415,050 offset by lower interest income of  $1,970,989.
The Company believes the increase in sales of equipment was primarily due
to increased effectiveness of a larger and more experienced salesforce at
obtaining  new business. Interest income for the fiscal year  ended  June
30,  1993  decreased  to $23,696,531 as compared to $25,667,520  for  the
fiscal  year ended June 30, 1992, partially due to lower interest  income
on  discounted  lease  rentals assigned to lenders (which  is  offset  by
interest  expense on nonrecourse debt) of $11,452,119 in the fiscal  year
ended June 30, 1993 versus $12,818,915 for the prior year.

      Net  interest  income  (interest income less  interest  expense  on
discounted  lease rentals assigned to lenders) for the fiscal year  ended
June  30,  1993 decreased by $604,193 or 4.7% as compared to  the  fiscal
year ended June 30, 1992. This net decrease resulted primarily from lower
amortization  of deferred income and lower investment income,  offset  by
increases in interest accretion due to a larger residual value base,  and
increases  in  interest  recognition on greater  minimum  lease  payments
receivable.

      Rental  income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 of  $747,229
decreased  by $55,977 or 7.0% as compared to the fiscal year  ended  June
30,  1992,  as  a  result of decreases in the volume of short-term  lease
renewals.
                                    
      GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 30,  1993
increased by $2,888,741, or 12.5%, to $26,083,067 compared to $23,194,326
for  the  fiscal year ended June 30, 1992. Gross profit as a  percent  of
total  revenues  decreased  to 15.9% of total revenues  for  fiscal  1993
compared to 17.8% of total revenues for the prior year. Additionally, the
cost of equipment sold as a percentage of sales of equipment increased to
91.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 versus 90.8% for the fiscal
year  ended  June  30, 1992. The principal factors which  contributed  to
higher  gross  profit were (i) increased profits from lease renewals  and
extensions,  (ii)  higher  profits  from  larger  volume  of  new   lease
transactions, and (iii) gains realized from the debt placement  of  lease
portfolios, offset by (iv) decreases in net interest income as  described
above.  The  lower  gross  profit margin and  higher  cost  of  equipment
percentages  reflect  a  greater percentage  of  the  Company's  revenues
derived  from new lease transactions and a decrease in the proportion  of
revenues from interest income during the most recent fiscal year.

      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general  and
administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  6.5%  for
the  fiscal  year ended June 30, 1993 as compared to 6.6% for the  fiscal
year  ended  June 30, 1992. Selling, general and administrative  expenses
for  the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 increased by $1,967,227 or 22.9%
as  compared  to  the prior year. This increase resulted  primarily  from
higher  sales  and finance staff personnel costs, higher variable  office
costs  related to the greater business volume and additions made  to  the
management organization to support future growth.

      INTEREST EXPENSE-OTHER. Interest expense-other was $89,067 for  the
year  ended June 30, 1993 as compared to $102,044 for the year ended June
30, 1992. The decrease of $12,977 is primarily the result of fewer fiscal
year  1993  interest assessments made as the result of regulatory  audits
with various federal, state and local agencies.

      TAXES.  The Company's tax rate was 36.5% and 37.1% for  the  fiscal
years  ended  June  30,  1993  and 1992, respectively,  representing  its
estimated annual tax rates for the years ending June 30, 1993 and 1992.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

      The Company funds its operating activities through nonrecourse debt
and  internally  generated  funds.  Capital  expenditures  for  equipment
purchases are primarily financed by assigning the lease payments to banks
or  other  financial institutions. The lease payments are  discounted  at
fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize
the  aggregate outstanding debt. The Company does not purchase  equipment
until  it  has  received  a noncancelable lease from  its  customer  and,
generally,  has  determined  that  the  lease  can  be  discounted  on  a
nonrecourse  basis.  At  June  30,  1994,  the  Company  had  outstanding
nonrecourse  debt  aggregating $225,746,187 relating to  equipment  under
capital  and operating leases. In the past, the Company has been able  to
obtain adequate nonrecourse funding commitments, and the Company believes
it will be able to do so in the future.

      The  Company borrowed $10,000,000 in December 1993 which is secured
by  an  in process lease transaction. The Company has a nonrecourse  debt
commitment  from  the  same financial institution to  finance  the  lease
transaction  once  the  lease  transaction is  completed.  The  lease  is
anticipated to be assigned on a nonrecourse basis prior to the  due  date
of  the  note and the commencement of the assignment, at which  time  the
recourse  note  will  be  paid  in full (see  Note  4  in  the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements).

      From time to time, the Company retains equipment leases in its  own
portfolio  rather  than  assigning the leases to financial  institutions.
During the fiscal year 1994, the Company increased its net investment  in
leases  held  in its own portfolio by $70,950. This minimal increase  was
primarily  due to i) a higher percentage of new lease transactions  being
assigned  on  a  non-recourse basis, ii) the assignment  of  three  lease
portfolios  during fiscal 1994 and iii) the cash flow from the  Company's
lease portfolio during fiscal 1994 exceeded the volume of new leases  and
renewals.

      The  Company  generally  funds  its equity  investments  in  leased
equipment and interim equipment purchases with internally generated funds
and, if necessary, borrowings under a $20,000,000 general line of credit.
At  June 30, 1994, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding on
this line of credit.

      In November 1990, the Board of Directors authorized management,  at
its  discretion,  to  repurchase up to 300,000 shares  of  the  Company's
Common   Stock.  During  the  year  ended  June  30,  1994,  the  Company
repurchased 10,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $188,750.   During  the
year  ended  June 30, 1993, the Company repurchased 2,322  shares  at  an
aggregate  cost of $43,988. As of August 20, 1994, 100,678 shares  remain
available under this authorization.

      The  need  for cash used for operating activities will continue  to
grow  as  the  Company expands.  The Company believes that existing  cash
balances,  cash  flow  from  operations, cash flows  from  its  financing
activities, available borrowings under its existing credit facility,  and
assignments  (on a nonrecourse basis) of anticipated lease payments  will
be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs.

      Inflation  has not had a significant impact upon the operations  of
the Company.

                REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                                    
                                    
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Amplicon, Inc.:




We  have  audited  the  accompanying consolidated  balance  sheets  of
Amplicon, Inc. (a California corporation) and subsidiaries as of  June
30,  1994  and  1993,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of
earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended June
30,   1994,  1993  and  1992.  These  financial  statements  are   the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility  is  to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit
to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are  free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on  a
test  basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in  the
financial  statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion, the financial statements referred to  above  present
fairly,  in all material respects, the financial position of Amplicon,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years  in
the  period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Our  audits  were made for the purpose of forming an  opinion  on  the
basic  financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed  in
the  index  of  financial  statements are presented  for  purposes  of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and  are
not a required part of the basic financial statements. These schedules
have  been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our  audits
of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in
all  material  respects, the financial data required to be  set  forth
therein  in  relation  to the basic financial statements  taken  as  a
whole.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying consolidated financial statements include the  accounts
of   the   Company  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All   material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The  Company  considers  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Leases
  Capital Leases

The  Company  engages  in  the lease and sale of  computer  hardware  and
software,  and other equipment. The Company adopted Financial  Accounting
Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 88-1 ("88-1") in fiscal year  1989
which  addressed  certain issues relating to accounting for  leases.  The
discounted  value  of the aggregate lease rentals is  recorded  as  sales
revenue.  Equipment cost, less the discounted value of the  residual,  if
any,  is recorded as cost of sales. Under 88-1, except for capital  lease
transactions in which the Company no longer has a continuing interest  in
the  leased  equipment, the Company defers gross profit  on  new  capital
leases  through  a  reduction  of  sales  revenue  recognized  at   lease
origination.  Gross profit which is deferred together with  the  unearned
interest  income  (and  interest expense if assigned)  is  recognized  as
interest  income (and expense) over the lease term based on  an  internal
rate  of  return  method. The Company recognizes certain interim  rentals
received as operating income prior to commencement of capital leases.

At the time of closing capital leases, the Company records on its balance
sheet the present value of the lease receivable as minimum lease payments
receivable  and,  if appropriate, the estimated residual  values  of  the
leased  equipment. The Company typically assigns, on a nonrecourse basis,
the  noncancelable  lease  rentals  to financial  institutions  at  fixed
interest  rates.  When  leases are assigned  to  financial  institutions,
without  recourse, the discounted value of the lease rentals is  recorded
on the balance sheet as discounted lease rentals assigned to lenders. The
related  obligation  resulting  from the discounting  of  the  leases  is
recorded  as  nonrecourse debt. In the event of default by a lessee,  the
lender has a first lien against the underlying leased equipment, with  no
further recourse against the Company.

Effective  July  1,  1988,  the Company adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 91, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs
Associated  With Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct  Costs
of   Leases."   A   portion  of  the  Company's  selling,   general   and
administrative  costs  directly  related to  originating  capital  leases
transactions during the period is deferred as an increase in revenues and
amortized  over  the lease term utilizing the effective interest  method.
See Note 5.

  Operating Leases

Lease  contracts  which do not meet the criteria of  capital  leases  are
accounted  for  as  operating leases. Equipment on  operating  leases  is
recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the  lease
term  to  the estimated residual value at the termination of  the  lease.
Rental  income  is recorded monthly or quarterly when due. Selling  costs
directly  associated with the operating leases are deferred and amortized
over the lease term.

Inventories

Inventories, which primarily represent partial deliveries of equipment on
in-process lease transactions whereby the lessee is legally obligated  to
accept,  are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method)  or
market value.

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Net Earnings per Common Share

Net  earnings per common share are computed based on the weighted  average
number of common shares outstanding during each fiscal year (5,848,594  in
1994, 5,830,561 in 1993 and 5,813,291 in 1992).

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications have been made to  the  fiscal  1993  and  1992
consolidated financial statements to conform with the presentation of  the
fiscal 1994 consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 - Receivables:

     The Company's net receivables consist of the following:

Note 4 - Notes Payable to Bank:

     In August 1993, the Company negotiated a $20,000,000 general business
loan  agreement  (the  "Agreement") with  a  Bank.  The  Agreement,  which
provides  for  borrowings  at  the Bank's reference  rate  or  the  Bank's
Offshore  rate plus 1.25%, allows for advances through December  31,  1994
with  rollover provisions to a term note, provided certain conditions  are
met  by  the Company. The term note is to be secured by certain qualifying
leases  and is to bear interest at the Bank's reference rate plus .50%  or
the  Bank's Offshore rate plus 1.75%. The term note requires repayment  in
three  equal  quarterly  installments of one  eighth  of  the  outstanding
balance  at the expiration date, commencing April 1, 1995, and  one  final
payment on December 31, 1995 for the remaining balance.

      The  Agreement  is  unsecured  and  excludes  any  arrangements  for
compensating balances; however, the Bank requires a commitment fee on  the
daily  average  unused amount of the Bank's $20,000,000 commitment.  Under
the  provisions  of the Agreement, the Company must maintain  certain  net
worth  requirements, a defined debt to net worth ratio and a defined ratio
of  certain  assets to defined debt.  As of June 30, 1994  there  were  no
outstanding balances on this Agreement.

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

      In  December 1993, the Company entered into an agreement, as amended
in  August  1994, to borrow $10,000,000 (the "Note") at an  interest  rate
equal  to  the  prime  rate. This Note is secured by an  in-process  lease
transaction (the "Lease"). This Lease is secured by an $11,000,000  letter
of credit issued by a different financial institution. Interest is payable
monthly  commencing January 15, 1994 and the Note is due  on  October  31,
1994.  The  financial  institution which issued the  Note  has  agreed  to
finance the Lease on a nonrecourse basis through the due date of the Note.

Note 5 - Deferred Interest Income and Net Deferred Income:

      At  June 30, 1994, deferred interest income of $24,192,113 is offset
by  deferred  interest expense related to the Company's  discounted  lease
rentals assigned to lenders of $24,192,113. See Note 3.

      At  June  30, 1994, the expected recognition of net deferred  income
(deferred  gross margin of $9,870,422  less deferred selling  expenses  of
$6,126,943) on the Company's future statements of earnings is as follows:

Note 6 - Income Taxes:

      Effective  July  1,  1993, the Company adopted Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 109 on Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109").   Among
other  provisions,  this standard requires deferred  tax  balances  to  be
determined using the enacted income tax rate for the years in which  taxes
will  be  paid or refunds received.  The adoption of SFAS No. 109 did  not
result in a charge to net income in 1994.  Prior year financial statements
were not restated to reflect the new accounting standard.

     The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:

Note 7 - Capital Structure:

      In  September 1986, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved
an  increase  in  the  number  of authorized shares  of  common  stock  to
20,000,000. The Board of Directors and stockholders further authorized the
issuance of 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock from time to time  in  one
or more series and to fix the voting powers, designations, preferences and
the  relative  participating, optional or other rights,  if  any,  of  any
wholly unissued series of preferred stock.

     In September 1984, the Company's stockholders approved a Stock Option
Plan  (the "Plan"), which, as amended, provides that stock options may  be
granted  to  officers, employees, consultants and other persons  who  have
made,  or will make, major contributions toward the growth and development
of  the  Company. Stock options that are granted may entitle the recipient
to  purchase shares of the Company's common stock at prices greater  than,
equal  to or less than the estimated fair market value at the date of  the
grant.  Under the Plan, stock options become exercisable over a  three  or
five year period, commencing with the first anniversary of the date of the
grant,  and  expire ten years from the date of the grant. The Company  has
reserved 650,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan.

Note 8 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

     The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments
in  compliance  with Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 on  Disclosure
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The estimates were made as  of
June 30, 1994 based on relevant market information.

     Fair value is a subjective and imprecise measurement that is based on
assumptions  and market data which require significant judgement  and  may
only  be valid at a particular point in time.  The use of different market
assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect  on  the
estimated  fair  value  amounts.  Accordingly, management  cannot  provide
assurance  that  the fair values presented are indicative of  the  amounts
that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

      The  estimated fair value of financial instruments and the valuation
techniques used to estimate the fair value were as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                               Estimated
  At June 30, 1994                                Book Value   Fair Value
     <S>                                         <C>          <C>
     Financial Assets:
       Cash and cash equivalents                 $29,334,914  $29,407,845
     Financial Liabilities:
       Note payable to bank                       10,000,000   10,000,000
</TABLE>

Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents:  For cash, the book value  is  a  reasonable
estimate of fair value. For cash equivalents with original maturities less
than  three  months, the estimated fair value is based on  the  respective
market prices.

Note  Payable  to  Bank:   The fair value of  the  Note  payable  to  bank
approximates  book  value  because the interest rate  on  this  instrument
adjusts  with  changes  in market interest rates  due  to  its  short-term
maturity.

      The fair value of the Company's net investment in capital leases  is
not a required disclosure under SFAS No. 107.

Litigation

      The  Company has been named in lawsuits arising out of the Company's
normal  business  activities.  The Company is  vigorously  defending  such
actions. Management does not expect the outcome of any of  these lawsuits,
individually and in the aggregate, to have a  material  adverse  effect on
the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

401(k) Plan

     Effective July 1, 1992, employees of the Company may participate in a
voluntary  defined  contribution plan (the "401K  Plan")  qualified  under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Under the 401K  Plan,
employees who have met certain age and service requirements may contribute
up  to  a certain percentage of their compensation. The Company will  make
contributions  equal  to 25 percent of employee contributions  which  will
completely  vest  over  a  seven  year  period.  The  Company   has   made
contributions during the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 of $39,602 and
$27,622, respectively.

2.   WHAT OBLIGATIONS THE COLLATERAL SECURES.

EACH ITEM OF COLLATERAL SHALL SECURE [NOT] <F1> (INITIALED
BY SIGNERS) ONLY THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT WHICH DEBTOR PROMISES
TO PAY IN PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW. [BUT ALSO ALL OTHER PRESENT AND
FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS OR OBLIGATIONS OF DEBTOR TO SECURED
PARTY OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE WHATSOEVER.] <F1> (INITIALED

3.   PROMISE TO PAY; TERMS AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.

Debtor promises to pay Secured Party (i) the total principal

shall mean the average rate quoted by the Wall Street

in the location of the Collateral within such State, but
will not remove the Collateral from such State without the
prior written consent of Secured Party (except that in the

5.   LATE CHARGES

(b)  that, except for the security interest granted hereby,
the Collateral is free from and will be kept free from all
liens, claims, security interests and encumbrances;
(c)  that no financing statement covering the Collateral or
any proceeds thereof is on file in favor of anyone other

(d)  that all information supplied and statements made by
Debtor in any financial, credit or accounting statement or
application for credit prior to, contemporaneously with or
subsequent to the execution of this Security Agreement with
respect to this transaction are and shall be true, correct,
valid and genuine; and

<F1> Bracketed items have been deleted on the original document.

<PAGE>
(e)  that Debtor has full authority to enter into this
Security Agreement and in so doing it is not violating its
charter or by-laws, and any law or regulation or agreement
with third parties, and it has taken all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate to make this Security Agreement
binding upon it.

7.   DEBTOR'S AGREEMENTS 

Debtor agrees:

(a)  to defend at Debtor's own cost any action, proceeding,
or claim affecting the Collateral:

(b)  to pay reasonable attorneys' fees [at least 15% of the
unpaid balance if not prohibited by law] <F2> (INITIALED BY
SIGNERS) and other expenses incurred by Secured Party in
enforcing its rights against Debtor under this Security
Agreement in the event that Secured Party's the prevailing
party. (INITIALED BY SIGNERS)  The parties agree that in all
cases the prevailing party* (INITIALED BY SIGNERS) *shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the non-prevailing party.

(c)  to pay promptly all taxes, assessments, license fees
and other public or private charges when levied or assessed
against the Collateral of this Security Agreement; and this
obligation shall survive the termination of this Security
Agreement;

(d)  that, if a certificate of title is required or
permitted by law, Debtor shall obtain such certificate with
respect to the Collateral, showing the security interest of
Secured Party thereon and in any event do everything
necessary or expedient to preserve or perfect the security
interest of Secured Party;

(e)  that Debtor will not misuse, fail to keep in good
repair, secrete or without the prior written consent of
Secured Party, sell, rent, lend, encumber or transfer any of
the Collateral notwithstanding Secured Party's right to
proceed to the extent that Debtor will ensure that Lessee
under Lease No. OL-7071 will comply with this provision.
(INITIALED BY SIGNERS)

(f)  that Secured Party may enter upon Debtor's premises or
wherever the Collateral may be located at any reasonable
time to inspect the Collateral and Debtor's books and
records pertaining to the Collateral, and Debtor shall
assist Secured Party in making such inspection; and

[(g) that the security interest granted by Debtor to Secured
Party shall continue effective irrespective of the payment
of the amount in Paragraph 3, or in any promissory note
executed in connection herewith so long as there are any
obligations of any kind, including obligations under
guaranties or assignments, owed by Debtor to Secured Party,
provided, however, upon any assignment of this Security
Agreement the Assignee shall thereafter be deemed for the
purpose of this Paragraph the Secured Party under this
Security Agreement.] <F2> (INITIALED BY SIGNERS)


8.   INSURANCE AND RISK OF LOSS

All risk of loss, damage to or destruction of the Collateral
shall at all times be on Debtor.  Debtor will procure
forthwith and maintain at Debtor's expense insurance against
all risks of loss or physical damage to the Collateral for
the full insurable value thereof for the life of this
Security Agreement plus breach of warranty insurance and
such other insurance thereon in amounts and against such
risks as Secured Party may specify, and shall promptly
deliver each policy to Secured Party with a standard long-
form mortgagee endorsement attached thereto showing loss
payable to Secured Party; and providing Secured Party with
not less than 30 days written notice of cancellation; each
such policy shall be in form, terms and amount and with
insurance carriers satisfactory to Secured Party; Secured
Party's acceptance of policies in lesser amounts or risks
shall not be a waiver of Debtor's foregoing obligations.  As
to Secured Party's interest in such policy, no act or
omission of Debtor or any of its officers, agents, employees
or representatives shall affect the obligations of the
insurer to pay the full amount of any loss.

Debtor hereby assigns to Secured Party any monies which may
become payable under any such policy of insurance and
irrevocably constitutes and appoints Secured Party as
Debtor's attorney in fact (a) to hold each original
insurance policy, (b) to make, settle and adjust claims
under each policy of insurance, (c) to make claims for any
monies which may become payable under such and other
insurance on the Collateral including returned or unearned
premiums, and (d) to endorse Debtor's name on any check,
draft or other instrument received in payment of claims or
returned or unearned premiums under each policy and to apply
the funds to the payment of the indebtedness owing to
Secured Party; provided, however, Secured Party is under no
obligation to do any of the foregoing.

Should Debtor fail to furnish such insurance policy to
Secured Party, or to maintain such policy in full force, or
to pay any premium in whole or in part relating thereto,
then Secured Party, without waiving or releasing any default
or obligation by Debtor, may (but shall be under no
obligation to do so) obtain and maintain insurance and pay
the premium therefor on behalf of Debtor and charge the
premium to Debtor's indebtedness under this Security
Agreement.  The full amount of any such premium paid by
Secured Party shall be payable by Debtor upon demand, and
failure to pay same shall constitute an event of default
under this Security Agreement.  For insurance obligations
under this paragraph it is acceptable to Secured Party that
the policies are maintained by Lessee under Lease Agreement
No. OL-7071, but it is Debtor's responsibility to ensure
that Lessee maintains proper insurance. (INITIALED BY
SIGNERS)

9.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT; ACCELERATION.

A very important element of this Security Agreement is that
Debtor make all its payments promptly as agreed and that the
Collateral continue to be in good condition and adequate
security for the indebtedness.

The following are events of default under this Security
Agreement which will allow Secured Party to take such action
under this Paragraph and under Paragraph 10 as it deems
necessary provided that Secured Party has given Debtor
written notice of such default and Debtor has failed to cure
such default within 10 days of receipt of such notice.
(INITIALED BY SIGNERS)

(a)  any of Debtor's obligations to Secured Party under
[any] <F2> (INITIALED BY SIGNERS) agreement with Secured
Party is not paid promptly when due.

(b)  Debtor breaches any warranty or provision hereof, or of
any note or of any other instrument or agreement delivered

10.  SECURED PARTIES REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT; CONSENT TO
ENTER PREMISES.

UPON DEBTOR'S DEFAULT AND AT ANY TIME THEREAFTER, SECURED
PARTY SHALL HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF A SECURED
PARTY UNDER THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND ANY OTHER
APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO ANY DEFICIENCY
REMAINING AFTER DISPOSITION OF THE COLLATERAL FOR WHICH
DEBTOR HEREBY AGREES TO REMAIN FULLY LIABLE.  DEBTOR AGREES
THAT SECURED PARTY, BY ITSELF OR ITS AGENT, MAY WITHOUT
NOTICE TO ANY PERSON AND WITHOUT JUDICIAL PROCESS OF ANY
KIND, ENTER INTO ANY PREMISES OR UPON ANY LAND OWNED, LEASED
OR OTHERWISE UNDER THE REAL OR APPARENT CONTROL OF DEBTOR OR
ANY AGENT OF DEBTOR WHERE THE COLLATERAL MAY BE OR WHERE
SECURED PARTY BELIEVES THE COLLATERAL MAY BE, AND
DISASSEMBLE, RENDER UNUSABLE AND/OR REPOSSESS ALL OR ANY
ITEM OF THE COLLATERAL, DISCONNECTING AND SEPARATING ALL
COLLATERAL FROM ANY OTHER PROPERTY.  Debtor expressly waives
all further rights to possession of the collateral after
default and all claims for injuries suffered through or loss
caused by such entering and/or repossession.  Secured Party
may require Debtor to assemble the collateral and return it
to Secured Party at a place to be designated by Secured
Party which is reasonably convenient to both parties.

Secured Party may sell or lease the Collateral at a time and
location of its choosing provided the Secured Party acts in
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.  Secured
Party will give Debtor reasonable notice of the time and
place of any public sale of the Collateral or of the time

disposition of the Collateral is to be made.  Unless
otherwise provided by law, the requirement of reasonable
notice shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage
prepaid, to the address of Debtor shown herein at least ten
days before the time of the sale or disposition.  Expenses
of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling and the
like shall include reasonable attorneys' fees and other
legal expenses.  Debtor understands that Secured Party's
rights are cumulative and not alternative.

11.  WAIVER OF DEFAULTS; AGREEMENT INCLUSIVE

Secured Party may in its sole discretion waive a default, or
cure, at Debtor's expense, a default.  Any such waiver in a
particular instance or of a particular default shall not be
a waiver of other defaults or the same kind of default at
another time.  No modification or change in this Security
Agreement or any related note, instrument or agreement shall
bind Secured Party unless in writing signed by Secured
Party.  No oral agreement shall be binding.

12.  FINANCING STATEMENTS; CERTAIN EXPENSES.

If permitted by law, Debtor authorizes Secured Party to file
a financing statement with respect to the Collateral signed
only by Secured Party, and to file a carbon, photograph or
other reproduction of this Security Agreement or of a
financing statement.  At the request of Secured Party,
Debtor will execute any financing statements, agreements or
documents, in form satisfactory to Secured Party which
Secured Party may deem necessary or advisable to establish
and maintain a perfected security interest in the
Collateral, and will pay the cost of filing or recording the
same in all public offices deemed necessary or advisable by
Secured Party.  Debtor also agrees to pay all costs and
expenses incurred by Secured Party in conducting UCC, tax or
other lien searches against the Debtor or the Collateral and
such other fees as may be agreed.

to prepay the indebtedness described in Paragraph 3, or in
any promissory note executed in connection with this
Security Agreement.  Debtor and Secured Party each hereby
waive any right to a trial by jury in any action or
proceeding with respect to, in connection with, or arising

considered events of default under Section 9 of this

the Lease transaction commences for any other reason, then
Debtor shall be required to obtain a new letter of credit,
