ITEM  1.  BUSINESS

          Baldwin Technology Company, Inc. ("Baldwin" or the "Company") is a
leading international manufacturer of material handling, accessory, control and
pre-press equipment for the printing industry.  The Company offers its
customers a broad range of products designed to enhance the productivity and
increase the cost-efficiency of printing presses while addressing the
environmental concerns and safety issues involved in the printing process.
Baldwin's products include cleaning systems, fountain solution and ink control
systems, press and web control systems, web and material handling systems,
newspaper inserter equipment and automated imposition and plate exposure
equipment.

          The Company sells its products both to printers to upgrade the
quality and capability of existing presses and to printing press manufacturers
which incorporate the Company's products with their own equipment for sale to
printers.  The Company has product development and manufacturing facilities, as
well as sales and service operations, in its three major sectors: the Americas,
Europe and Asia Pacific.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

          Baldwin operates in a highly fragmented market.  The Company defines
its business as that of providing material handling, accessory, control and
pre-press equipment for the printing industry.  The Company believes that it
produces the most complete line of material handling, accessory, control and
pre-press equipment for the printing industry.

          The Company's products are used by printers engaged in all printing
processes including lithography, gravure, letterpress and flexography.  The
Company's products are designed to improve the printing processes in terms of
both quality of the finished product as well as the efficiency.  The largest
share of its business is in offset printing.  Offset printing is the largest
segment of the domestic printing market and is used primarily for printing
magazines, business forms, catalogs, greeting cards, packaging and newspapers.

          Although offset printing represents a significant segment of the U.S.
commercial printing industry, it is not currently the most significant segment
of the international printing market.  The Company believes that the future
growth of this international market will be attributable in large part to the
increased use of offset printing.  The Company has established operations in
each of its three major sectors to take advantage of growth opportunities in
these markets.  Baldwin's worldwide operations enable it to closely monitor new
product developments in different printing markets and to introduce new
products, or adapt existing ones, to meet the printing requirements of specific
local markets throughout the world.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS

          The Company manufactures and sells more than 150 different products
to printers and printing press manufacturers.  The Company's product
development is focused on the needs of the printer.  Typically, it takes a new
product several years after its introduction to make a significant contribution
to the Company's net sales.  Initially, after the introduction of a new
product, the Company's marketing efforts usually focus on printers.  With the
exception of the Company's Kansa and Misomex product lines, as a product
progresses through its life cycle, the percentage of sales to printing press
manufacturers generally increases as the product's acceptance by the industry
increases and printers begin to specify certain of the Company's products as
part of their accessory equipment package when ordering new presses.  The
Company's Kansa and Misomex product lines are primarily marketed to printers.
Historically, the Company's products have had





                                       1
<PAGE>   4
a long life cycle as the Company continually upgrades and refines its product
lines to meet customer needs and changes in printing press technology.  The
Company's product lines have expanded about equally through both internal
product development and acquisitions of product lines and companies.

          The Company's products range in price from under $100 to
approximately $325,000.  Baldwin's principal products are:

          CLEANING SYSTEMS.  The Company's first Cleaning Systems product was
the Press Washer which cleaned the ink train of an offset press.  Additional
Cleaning Systems products include the Automatic Blanket Cleaner, Newspaper
Blanket Cleaner and Chill Roll Cleaner and more recently the Guide Roll
Cleaner, which all reduce paper waste, volatile organic compound ("VOC")
solvent usage and press downtime, as well as improve productivity, print
quality and safety of operation for the press operator.  In the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, net sales of Cleaning Systems represented
approximately 32.6%, 37.8% and 37.6% of the Company's net sales, respectively.

          FOUNTAIN SOLUTION CONTROL SYSTEMS.  Fountain Solution Control Systems
control the supply, temperature, cleanliness, chemical composition and certain
other characteristics of water used in the offset printing process.  Among the
most important of these products are the Company's Refrigerated Circulators,
which circulate and control the fountain solution within the printing press.
In the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, net sales of Fountain
Solution Control Systems represented approximately 12.6%, 11.7% and 14.8% of
the Company's net sales, respectively.

          INK CONTROL SYSTEMS.  The Company's Ink Control Systems control and
regulate many aspects of the ink feed system on a printing press.  These
products include Ink Agitators, Ink Mixers and Ink Level Systems which reduce
wasted ink, paper and VOC solvent usage and allow for the use of recycled ink
containers.

          IN-LINE FINISHING SYSTEMS.  The Company's In-line Finishing products
allow printers to perform automatically, at press speeds, functions which
previously required special handling in the bindery.  These functions include
numbering, perforating, gluing and cutting.

          MATERIAL HANDLING/STACKING SYSTEMS.  Baldwin's Material
Handling/Stacking Systems automate the handling of the printed product.
Counting, stacking, book-packing and compressing printed materials help to
increase press utilization and productivity, reduce and control waste and
decrease pressroom labor requirements.

          WEB CONTROL AND PRESS PROTECTION SYSTEMS.  The Company's Web Control
Systems improve print quality by precisely controlling the flow of paper
through a web offset press while also reducing waste and increasing press
productivity.  The Company's Press Protection Systems, designed in response to
the increasing number of web leads used in printing today's colorful
newspapers, provide an auto-arming electronic package offering high quality
press protection in the event of a web break.

          WEB HANDLING SYSTEMS.  The Company's Web Handling Systems, produced
by its Enkel and Amal subsidiaries, unwind, rewind and splice paper and other
materials supplied to presses in webs and also control the tension and position
of web materials.  This equipment eliminates unnecessary press stoppages and
allows a more efficient flow of printed work.  In the fiscal years ended June
30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, net sales of Web Handling Systems represented
approximately 12.9%, 11.6% and 8.9% of the Company's net sales, respectively.

          NEWSPAPER INSERTER EQUIPMENT AND MAILING MACHINE SYSTEMS.  The
Company's Newspaper Inserter Equipment collates and inserts sections and
advertising





                                       2
<PAGE>   5
material into newspapers.  Its Mailing Machine Systems fold, label and prepare
newspapers for mailing.


          AUTOMATED IMPOSITION, PLATE EXPOSURE AND PLOTTING AND CUTTING
SYSTEMS.  The Company's Automated Imposition and Plate Exposure Systems are
used by printers to automate a labor intensive operation that results in the
high quality and accuracy of images on plates used in the offset printing
process.  The Company's Plotting and Cutting systems are widely used in the
packaging and corrugated carton industries and are designed to plot, cut,
crease and mill a wide range of materials.  In the fiscal years ended June 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992, net sales of Automated Imposition and Plate Exposure
Systems represented approximately 14.0%, 12.8% and 12.8% of the Company's net
sales, respectively.

WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS

          The Company believes that it is the only manufacturer of material
handling, accessory, control and pre-press equipment for the printing industry
which has complete product development, manufacturing and marketing facilities
in three major sectors: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

         The following table sets forth the percentages of the Company's net
sales attributable to its three sectors in the fiscal years ended June 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992:

</TABLE>

         In its Americas sector, the Company operates in North, Central and
South America through its four U.S. subsidiaries.  In its European sector, the
Company operates through its German subsidiary, which was established in 1972,
and through its other operating subsidiaries in Sweden, the Netherlands and
England.  In its Asia Pacific sector, the Company operates through its
subsidiaries in Japan (established in 1968), Hong Kong, China and Australia.
All of the Company's subsidiaries are wholly owned.

         For additional information relating to the Company's operations in its
three principal sectors, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Company.

ACQUISITION STRATEGY

         An important element of the Company's growth strategy is to make
strategic acquisitions of companies and product lines in related business
areas.  The Company's acquisition strategy involves (i) acquiring new material
handling, accessory, control and pre-press products for the printing industry
which can be sold through the Company's own, or the acquired entity's,
distribution network and which can benefit from the Company's manufacturing
expertise and financial support; (ii) entering new end-user market segments or
extending existing markets; and (iii) acquiring companies which contribute new
products to the Company or which help the Company manufacture and sell its
products outside the United States.  After it makes an acquisition, the Company
typically supports the existing management of the acquired entity and
participates actively with that management in implementing operational
strategies with a view to enhancing the entity's sales, productivity and
operating results.

MARKETING, SALES AND SUPPORT

         MARKETING.  The Company markets its products in almost all developed
countries throughout the world.  Although Baldwin markets a similar line of
products in each of these countries, its product mix and distribution channels
vary from country to country.  The Company has 100 direct sales representatives
in its three principal markets and approximately 185 dealers worldwide.  The
Company markets its products to printing press manufacturers and to printers.
Baldwin estimates that for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 approximately
41% of its net sales were to printing press manufacturers and approximately 59%
of its net sales were directly to printers.

         In its Americas sector, the Company markets its products primarily
through direct sales representatives.  In its European sector, the Company
utilizes both direct sales representatives and an extensive dealer network.  In
its Asia Pacific sector, the Company markets its products through direct sales
representatives in Japan, Hong Kong, China and Australia and through dealers
throughout the rest of Asia.

         SUPPORT.   The Company is committed to after-sales service and support
of its products throughout the world.  Baldwin employs approximately 113
service technicians, who are complemented by product engineers, to provide
field service for the Company's products on a global basis.

         BACKLOG.  The Company's backlog was $58,455,000 as of June 30, 1994,
$56,088,000 as of June 30, 1993 and $53,191,000 as of June 30, 1992.  Backlog
represents product orders which Baldwin has received from its customers under
valid contracts or purchase orders.

         CUSTOMERS.  The Company has a diverse customer base.  In the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1994 no customer accounted for 10% of the Company's net
sales.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, one customer accounted for
11.3% of the Company's net sales.  The ten largest customers of Baldwin
accounted for less than 41% of the Company's net sales for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1994.  Sales of Baldwin's products are not seasonal.  However,
its sales have traditionally been greater in the second six months of its
fiscal year than in the first six months of its fiscal year.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING

         The Company believes its research and development effort has been an
important factor in establishing and maintaining its leadership position in the
field of material handling, accessory, control and pre-press equipment for the
printing industry.  Baldwin has devoted substantial efforts to adapt its
products to almost all models and sizes of printing presses in use worldwide.

         The Company has product development facilities at each of its
manufacturing locations.  This decentralized approach to research and
development permits the Company to react quickly to meet the needs of its
customers.

         Baldwin employs approximately 149 persons whose primary function is
new product development or modification of existing products.  The Company's
total expenditures for research, development and engineering for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $15,409,000, $16,711,000 and
$16,970,000, respectively, representing approximately 8% of the Company's net
sales in each year.

PATENTS

         The Company owns and licenses a number of patents and patent
applications relating to a substantial number of Baldwin's products.  These
products represented a substantial portion of the Company's net sales in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.  The Company's patents expire at different
times through June, 2009; however, the expiration of patents in the near future
is not expected





                                       4

to have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales.  The Company has also
relied upon and intends to continue to rely upon unpatented proprietary
technology, including the proprietary engineering required to adapt its
products to a wide range of models and sizes of printing presses.  The Company
believes its rights under, and interests in, its patents and patent
applications, as well as its proprietary technology, are sufficient for its
business as currently conducted.

MANUFACTURING

         The Company conducts its manufacturing operations through a number of
operating subsidiaries in each of its three sectors.  In North America, the
Company's Baldwin Americas Corporation has subsidiaries with manufacturing
facilities located on the East Coast, in the Midwest and on the West Coast.

         In Europe, the Company has subsidiaries with manufacturing and
assembly facilities in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  These
facilities manufacture and assemble complete lines of products that are in
demand by printers worldwide and by printing press manufacturers in Europe for
shipment throughout the world.  The Company also has sales/service facilities
in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  Baldwin's Japanese and Chinese
subsidiaries manufacture and assemble the Company's products and, with sales
support from the Company's Hong Kong and Australian subsidiaries, market them
throughout Asia.

         In general, raw materials required by the Company can be obtained from
various sources in the quantities desired.  The Company has no long-term supply
contracts and does not consider itself dependent on any individual supplier.

         The nature of most operations of the Company is such that there is
little, if any, negative effect upon the environment, and the Company has not
experienced any serious problems in complying with environmental protection
laws and regulations.

COMPETITION

         The printing press accessory industry is highly fragmented.  Although
the Company believes it produces the most complete line of material handling,
accessory, control and pre-press equipment for the printing industry, numerous
companies manufacture and sell products that compete with one or more of the
Company's products.  The Company competes from time to time with printing press
manufacturers who, as a part of their businesses, produce material handling,
accessory and control equipment for the printing industry and who generally
have larger staffs and greater financial resources than the Company.

         The Company competes by offering customers a broad product line,
coupled with a well-known reputation for the reliability of its products and
its commitment to service and after-sale support.  Some of the Company's
products with patent protection have little or no direct competition.  The
Company's ability to compete effectively in the future will depend upon the
continued reliability of its products, after-sale service, ability to keep its
market position as its patents expire and ability to develop new products which
meet the demands of the printing industry.

EMPLOYEES

         The Company employs 1,055 persons, 505 of whom are production
employees and approximately 142 of whom are management and administrative
employees.  Approximately 34% of the Company's 126 employees in its Baldwin
Graphic Products Division in the United States are represented by the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers under a contract
which expires on November 9, 1996.  Approximately 29 and 27 of the Company's
120 employees at its Misomex AB subsidiary are represented by the Swedish
Industrial Salaried Employees'





                                       5
<PAGE>   8
Association and the Swedish Metal Workers' Union, respectively, under contracts
for indefinite terms.  At Amal AB in Sweden, 3 employees are represented by
Ledarna (SALF), 28 employees are represented by Lundsorganisationen, Metall and
20 employees are represented by Tjanstemannene Central Organisation, Svenska
Industritjanstemanna Forbundet under contracts with indefinite terms.  At
Baldwin Gegenheimer GmbH, a German subsidiary of the Company, approximately 44
of the Company's 224 employees are represented by the IG Metall (Metalworker's
Union) under a contract with indefinite terms.  The Company considers relations
with its employees and with its unions to be good.

ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES

         The Company's facilities are divided among its three sectors and total
approximately 632,000 square feet.

         In North America, manufacturing and office space leased by the Company
and its subsidiaries total approximately 280,000 square feet of which space
approximately 8,400 square feet is sublet.  An additional 52,800 square feet of
office and manufacturing space is owned by Kansa Corporation, subject to an
Industrial Revenue Bond.

         In Europe, the Company has leased facilities totalling approximately
204,000 square feet comprised of office and manufacturing facilities in Germany
(approximately 113,000 square feet), Sweden (approximately 64,000 square feet),
the United Kingdom (approximately 23,000 square feet) and the Netherlands
(approximately 4,000 square feet).  In addition, the Company owns manufacturing
facilities in Sweden totalling approximately 61,000 square feet.

         In Asia, the Company leases office and manufacturing facilities of
approximately 30,700 square feet in Japan and office facilities aggregating
approximately 2,800 square feet in Hong Kong, Beijing, Melbourne and Sydney.

         The Company believes that its facilities are adequate to carry on its
business as currently conducted.

ITEM  3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         There are no legal proceedings pending to which the Company is a party
or to which any of its property is subject, other than routine litigation
incidental to the Company's business or which is covered by insurance and which
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

ITEM  4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders since November
18, 1993.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         GENERAL.  The Company does not consider its business to be seasonal;
however, its sales have traditionally been greater in the second six months of
its fiscal year than in the first six months of its fiscal year.  The following
schedule shows the Company's net sales for six month periods over the last five
fiscal years to reflect the comparison.

COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1994 VERSUS FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,
1993

         The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain
significant factors which have affected the Company's financial position and
consolidated financial statements.

         NET SALES.  Net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994
decreased by $17,704,000, or 8.2%, to $198,055,000 from $215,759,000 for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.  The decrease in sales for 1994 was due
primarily to product volume.  Currency rate fluctuations attributable to the
Company's overseas operations accounted for a decrease of $3,195,000 in net
sales for the current year.

         In terms of local currency, sales changes were mixed within the
European Sector.  Sales increased in Sweden by 24.4%, increased in the United
Kingdom by 1.5% and decreased in Germany by 17.7%.  In the Company's Asia
Pacific Sector, local currency sales decreased 20.4% in Japan but increased in
Australia, Hong Kong and China.  In the Americas Sector net sales increased by
4% for the year due to a continued strengthening in the U.S. printing equipment
market.

         GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994
was $68,004,000 (34.3% of net sales), as compared to $73,195,000 (33.9% of net
sales) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, a decrease of $5,191,000 or
7.1%.  The primary reason for the decline in gross profit was decreased volume.
Currency rate fluctuations decreased gross profit by $930,000.

         SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses were $42,068,000 (21.2% of net sales) for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1994, as compared to $42,532,000 (19.7% of net sales) for
the prior year a decrease of $464,000.  Currency rate fluctuations reduced the





                                       10
<PAGE>   13
current year's expenses by $711,000.  Although the Company continued to
implement cost reduction and control programs during fiscal 1994, the benefits
derived from these actions were largely offset by an increase in bad debt
expense.  During fiscal 1994 the Company increased its reserve for bad debts by
approximately $1,300,000 relating to a Japanese customer which filed for
reorganization.  Selling expenses increased in fiscal 1994 also, due to
increased trade show expenses, new product introduction costs and a planned
increase in marketing and selling personnel.

         INTEREST EXPENSE.  Interest expense for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1994 was $3,694,000, as compared to $5,850,000 for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1993.  Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the Company
refinancing its debts at lower interest rates and a reduction in the amount of
outstanding indebtedness.  Foreign currency exchange effects reduced interest
expense by $635,000.  Interest income was $381,000 and $285,000 for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993, respectively.  Other income was
$887,000 and $462,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and June 30,
1993, respectively, with the increase primarily due to increased royalty
income.

         INCOME TAXES.  The Company's effective tax rate was 49% for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1994 as compared to 54% for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1993.  The effective rate reflects the impact of foreign source income which is
taxed at substantially higher rates than domestic income.  The decrease from
the prior year's effective rate is primarily caused by income generated by
domestic operations which is taxed at rates which are generally lower than
foreign rates and the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax
benefits (see Note 10--Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

         NET INCOME.  Net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994
increased to $4,132,000 from $3,790,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1993.  Net income for the year ended June 30, 1993 includes an extraordinary
charge on extinguishment of debt of $1,105,000 or $0.06 per share and a benefit
for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of
$1,229,000 or $0.07 per share (see Notes 9 and 10--Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).  Net income per share was $0.23 and $0.22 for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Weighted average equivalent
shares outstanding during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and June 30,
1993 were 18,015,295 and 17,592,845, respectively.


COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1993 VERSUS FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,
1992

         The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain
significant factors which have affected the Company's financial position and
consolidated financial statements.

         NET SALES.  Net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993
decreased by $5,715,000, or 2.6%, to $215,759,000 from $221,474,000 for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  Currency rate fluctuations attributable to
the Company's overseas operations accounted for an increase of $6,184,000 in
net sales for the current year, substantially all of which was in the Asia
Pacific Sector.  The overall decrease in sales for 1993 was due primarily to
product volume.

         In terms of local currency, the Company's European Sector net sales
decreased 9.6% as a result of a slowdown in that sector's German printing
equipment market.  The sector's Swedish, Dutch and British markets either
increased or equalled prior year sales.  In the Company's Asia Pacific Sector,
local currency sales decreased 15.9% due to the economic slowdown in the
Japanese market.  Domestic net sales increased by 13.5% for the year due to a
strengthening in the U.S. printing equipment market experienced throughout the
Company's Americas Sector.





                                       11
<PAGE>   14

         GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993
was $73,195,000 (33.9% of net sales), as compared to $74,403,000 (33.6% of net
sales) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, a decrease of $1,208,000 or
1.6%.  Currency rate fluctuations favorably impacted margins by $1,887,000, but
the effect was offset by lower sales levels.

         SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses were $42,532,000 (19.7% of net sales) for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1993, as compared to $41,575,000 (18.8% of net sales) for
the prior year.  Currency rate fluctuations added $463,000 to the current
year's expenses.  The remaining increase was due to increased bad debt
allowances which offset the benefits of cost reduction and control programs.
Total operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 1993 include a
restructuring charge (see Note 5--Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
of $880,000 relating to workforce rationalization and were impacted unfavorably
by $997,000 due to currency rate fluctuations.

         INTEREST EXPENSE.  Interest expense for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1993 was $5,850,000, as compared to $7,167,000 for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1992.  Decreased interest expense, which is primarily related to
acquisition financing, is mainly due to reductions in outstanding indebtedness
and declining interest rates.  Foreign currency exchange effects were minimal.
Interest income was $285,000 and $483,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30,
1993 and June 30, 1992, respectively.

         INCOME TAXES.  The Company's effective tax rate was 54% for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1993 as compared to 90.7% for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1992.  The effective rate reflects the impact of foreign source income
which is taxed at substantially higher rates than domestic income.  The
decrease from the prior year's effective rate is primarily caused by income
generated by domestic operations which is taxed at rates which are generally
lower than foreign rates and the benefit of previously unrecognized deferred
taxes (see Note 10--Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

         INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  Income from continuing operations
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 increased to $3,666,000 from $770,000
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  Income per share from continuing
operations was $0.21 and $0.05 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  Weighted average equivalent shares outstanding during the
fiscal years ended June 30, 1993 and June 30, 1992 were 17,592,845 and
17,105,750, respectively.

         NET LOSS OR INCOME.  Net income for the year ended June 30, 1993 of
$3,790,000 or $0.22 per share includes the extraordinary charge on
extinguishment of debt of $1,105,000 or $0.06 per share and a benefit for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of $1,229,000 or
$0.07 per share (see Notes 9 and 10--Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) and increased by $328,000 due to currency rate fluctuations.  For
the year ended June 30, 1992, the net loss of $6,966,000 or $0.41 per share
included the net loss from discontinued operations (see Note 3--Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) of $1,842,000 or $0.11 per share as well as
the loss on disposal of the discontinued operations of $5,894,000 or $0.35 per
share.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

         The Company's results are affected by the impact of inflation on
manufacturing and operating costs.  Historically, the Company has used selling
price adjustments, cost containment programs and improved operating
efficiencies to offset the otherwise negative impact of inflation on its
operations.





                                       12

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         On October 29, 1993, the Company completed the refinancing of it's
long-term debt with the issuance of $25,000,000 of 8.17% senior notes (the
"Senior Notes") due October 29, 2000.  The Senior Notes require the payment of
interest only for the first three years with equal annual principal repayments
of $6,250,000 in each of years four through seven.  The proceeds of the Senior
Notes along with approximately $5,000,000 in available cash were used to retire
all of the Company's indebtedness under a Credit Agreement with a syndicate of
banks dated September 27, 1990.

         In November, 1993, the Company entered into a three-year $20,000,000
Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Revolver") with NationsBank of North Carolina
as Agent.  The Senior Notes and the Revolver require the Company to maintain
certain financial covenants and have certain restrictions regarding the payment
of dividends, limiting them throughout the terms of the Senior Notes and the
Revolver to $3,000,000 plus 50% of the Company's net income after June 30,
1993.  In addition, the Company was required to pledge certain of the shares of
it's domestic subsidiaries as collateral for both the Senior Notes and the
Revolver.

         Both the Senior Notes and the Revolver require the Company to maintain
a ratio of current assets to current liabilities (as those terms are defined in
the agreements) of not less than 1.4 to 1.  At June 30, 1994, this ratio was
1.77 to 1.

         The net cash used by investing activities increased by $2,093,000 from
$2,370,000 at June 30, 1993 to $4,463,000 at June 30, 1994 primarily due to the
capitalization of $1,203,000 of costs associated with the Company's debt
refinancing as well as a $1,383,000 increase in the recorded amount of prepaid
income taxes.  The net cash used by financing activities increased during the
period ended June 30, 1994 as compared to the period ended June 30, 1993
primarily due to the differential between sales and purchases of treasury
stock.

         The Company's working capital increased by $10,684,000 or 31% from
$34,414,000 at June 30, 1993 to $45,098,000 at June 30, 1994.  The net increase
was largely attributable to decreases in loans payable and the current-portion
of long-term debt which resulted from the Company's debt refinancing.
Currency effects increased working capital by $1,242,000 for the period.
Decreases in net trade receivables and inventories were partially offset by
increases in other current assets which increased primarily due to officer
loans of $2,145,000 and royalties receivable of $527,000 for the period.  The
net decrease in current assets was more than offset by the decrease in current
liabilities for the period.  Decreases in trade payables more than offset the
decreases in cash and short-term securities.

         The Company maintains relationships with foreign and domestic banks
which have extended credit facilities to the Company totaling $32,600,000,
including amounts available under the Revolver.  As of June 30, 1994, the
Company had outstanding $9,253,000 under these lines of credit, of which
$3,362,000 is classified as long-term debt.  Total debt levels as reported on
the balance sheet at June 30, 1994 are $299,000 higher then they would have
been if June 30, 1993 exchange rates had been used.

         Net capital expenditures made to meet the normal business needs of the
Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993, including
commitments for capital lease payments, were $1,819,000 and $2,042,000,
respectively.





                                       13

         The Company believes its cash flow from operations and available bank
lines of credit are sufficient to finance its working capital and other capital
requirements for the near and long-term future.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
BALDWIN TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.

         In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the
related consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity
and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Baldwin Technology Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries at June 30,
1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes by adopting FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", effective July 1, 1992.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION OF BUSINESS:

         Baldwin Technology Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Baldwin" or
the "Company") are engaged primarily in the development, manufacture and sale
of material handling, accessory, control and pre-press equipment for the
printing industry.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

         The following are the significant accounting policies followed by the
Company:

         CONSOLIDATION.  The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Baldwin and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

         TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  All assets and liabilities of
foreign subsidiaries are translated into dollars at year-end (current) exchange
rates and components of revenue and expense are translated at average rates for
the year.  The resulting translation adjustments are included in shareholders'
equity.  Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange transactions are
reflected in the statement of income.  Net transaction gains, credited to
income for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $48,000, $140,000
and $264,000, respectively.

         INVENTORIES.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for domestic
inventories and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for foreign inventories.
If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories, the total stated amount
for inventories would have been $453,000 and $261,000 greater as of June 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

         PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  The Company depreciates its assets over their
estimated useful lives.  Plant and equipment additions are depreciated using
primarily the straight-line method.  Repair and maintenance expenditures are
expensed as incurred.

         PATENT, TRADEMARKS AND ENGINEERING DRAWINGS.  The cost of acquired
patents, trademarks and engineering drawings are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.

         GOODWILL.  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the
fair market value of net assets acquired and is being amortized over 40 years
on a straight-line basis.  Goodwill is measured for possible impairment, as of
each balance sheet date, based upon undiscounted future cash flows from the
related operations.  Should such undiscounted future cash flows be less than
the carrying value, a charge to operations for the shortfall would be provided.
Goodwill increased $526,000 in fiscal 1994 (decreased $10,924,000 in fiscal
1993) due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, primarily on the
portion of goodwill related to the European operations which is predominately
denominated in Swedish Krona.

         DEFERRED LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS.  At June 30, 1994, these costs were
$1,903,000 less $628,000 of accumulated amortization ($700,000 less $336,000 of
accumulated amortization at June 30, 1993) and were included in "Other Assets".
Deferred loan origination costs related to the Company's debt which was





                                       23
<PAGE>   26
refinanced during fiscal 1994 (see Note 9--Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) were charged off at June 30, 1993.

         NET INCOME PER SHARE.  Net income per share is based on the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period.  Common equivalent shares outstanding for the years ended June 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992 were 83,770, 19,575 and 304,052, respectively.

NOTE 3--DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

         During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992, the Company adopted a formal
plan to discontinue operations of its thermographic and forms handling
business.  The Company completed the disposition of it's thermographic and
forms handling business in fiscal 1993.

         The fiscal 1992 provision of $5,894,000 for loss on disposal of
discontinued operations includes a provision to dispose of all assets,
anticipated phase-out losses from operations until final disposition, accruals
of employee benefit and severance costs, settlement of lease obligations and
other anticipated expenses.

         The operating (loss) of the thermographic and forms handling
operations comprised the following for the year ended June 30, 1992:

NOTE 4--RECLASSIFICATION:

         The Company previously classified a portion of it's Technical Service
activities as a net operating expense prior to 1994 in financial statement
presentations.  In 1994, technical Service expense was reclassified for all
periods presented as a component of Cost of Goods Sold.  Technical Service
expenses previously recorded as operating expenses in the amounts of
$2,732,000, $2,379,000, $1,724,000 and $730,000 for the periods ended June 30,
1993, 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively, were reclassified to Cost of Goods
Sold.

         During the year, the Company reclassified the expense for amortization
of intangible assets, (i.e., patents, engineering drawings and trademarks,
goodwill and deferred loan origination costs), that were previously recorded as
a component of "Other Expense" to "General and Administrative Expense".
Intangible amortization in the amounts of $2,499,000, $2,474,000, $2,528,000
and $1,051,000 for the periods ended June 30, 1993, 1992, 1991 and 1990,
respectively, were reclassified to General and Administrative Expense.

NOTE 5--RESTRUCTURING CHARGE:

         Historically, the Company has used cost containment and reduction
programs to offset unfavorable changes in business activity due to the economy.
As a result of the deepening recession in parts of Europe, the Company
established a restructuring reserve of $880,000 during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1993 related to the rationalization of its workforce.  During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1992, a restructuring charge of $1,706,000 was accrued to
cover the costs of consolidating certain facilities and product lines in order
to reduce excess manufacturing capacity and reduce certain administrative
costs.  The Company has classified the recorded liabilities as current in
"Other accrued liabilities".

         At June 30, 1994, there were no remaining accrued liabilities for the
restructuring reserve established for the year ended June 30, 1993 for
workforce rationalization.  The remaining $764,000 liability established for
the restructuring reserve for the year ended June 30, 1992 relates to excess
facility sublease subsidy and relocation costs of certain facilities in the
amounts of $454,000 and $310,000, respectively.

NOTE 6--BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:

         The Company operates primarily in the printing industry.  The Company,

</TABLE>


         Notes payable, denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
increased by $299,000, (decreased by $2,656,000 in 1993), due to translation
rates in effect at June 30, 1994 when compared to rates at June 30, 1993.

         The industrial revenue bonds are collateralized by the building and
specific equipment as outlined in the indenture relating thereto.
Approximately $408,000 of the loans included above are collateralized by assets
of a foreign subsidiary of the Company.  The notes payable from October, 1997
through October, 2000 (the "Senior Notes") and note payable November, 1997 (the
"Revolver", a $20,000,000 credit facility) are collateralized by a pledge of
the capital stock of the Company's domestic subsidiaries.  The Company
refinanced its long-term debt through the issuance of $25,000,000 of
seven-year, 8.17% unsecured Senior Notes privately placed with an institutional
lender.  The Senior Notes require payment of interest only for the first three
years with equal annual principal repayments in years four through seven.  The
Senior Notes and the Revolver require the Company to maintain certain financial
covenants and have certain restrictions regarding the payments of dividends,
limiting them to $3,000,000 plus 50% of the Company's net income after June 30,
1993.  In addition, both the Senior notes and the Revolver require the Company
to maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities (as these terms
are defined in the agreements) of not less than 1.4 to 1.  At June 30, 1994,
this ratio was 1.77 to 1.  In

conjunction with the refinancing, the Company applied approximately $5,000,000
of cash reflected on the June 30, 1993 balance sheet to a reduction of its
long-term debt.  The Company expensed all previously deferred loan origination
costs in connection with the refinanced debt in the amount of $1,105,000 (after
tax benefits of $384,000).  The charge is classified as an extraordinary item
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

         Maturities of long-term debt in each fiscal year succeeding June 30,
1994 are as follows:

         At June 30, 1994, the Company had available lines of credit of
$32,600,000 upon which $9,253,000 had been drawn and of which $3,362,000 is
included in long-term debt.  Only the Revolver has associated commitment fees
with that line of credit.  The commitment fees, which are calculated quarterly,
are equal to between one-quarter and one-half of one percent per annum of the
unused portion of the Revolver.  Commitment fees for the seven months ended
June 30, 1994 were $29,000.

NOTE 10--TAXES ON INCOME:

         The Company adopted FAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", effective
July 1, 1992.  The cumulative effect on prior years of the adoption of this new
accounting principle was a benefit of $1,229,000 reported as a separate
component of net income, and a corresponding deferred tax asset.  The Company
has not recognized the benefit of any unused net operating loss carryforwards
as the result of adopting FAS 109.  The Company had previously been accounting
for income taxes under FAS 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes".

         Income from continuing operations before taxes and the provision for

         Income tax benefits allocated to currently payable taxes from the
domestic and foreign extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt were $9,000
and $375,000, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 1993.  Income tax
benefits allocated to currently payable taxes from domestic discontinued
operations amounted to $60,000 for the year ended June 30, 1992.

         Income tax benefits allocated to foreign prepaid taxes due to the
cumulative effect of adopting FAS 109 were $1,229,000 for the year ended June
30, 1993.

         Deferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences between
the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the Company's assets and
liabilities.  The opening balance of the valuation allowance was decreased by
$1,200,000 during the current year due to the improvement in domestic earnings.
The principal temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities at June 30, 1994 are as follows:

         At June 30, 1994, the Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards for
book purposes of $8,360,000 and for tax purposes of $7,291,000, which expire
from fiscal 1995 to fiscal 1999.  At June 30, 1994, net operating loss
carryforwards of $21,263,000 are available to reduce future foreign taxable
income ($370,000 of which expire from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999, $2,649,000 of
which expire from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2002 and the remainder of which have an
indefinite carryforward period).

         It has not been necessary to provide for income taxes on $8,451,000 of
cumulative undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States
because of the Company's intention to reinvest those reserves.  In those
instances where the Company expects to remit earnings, the tax effect on the
results of operations after considering available tax credits would not be
significant.

         The total income tax expense allocated to continuing operations was
more than the computed "expected" tax (determined by applying the United States
Federal statutory income tax rate of 34% to income from continuing operations
before taxes) by $1,215,000, $1,594,000 and $4,693,000 for the years ended June
30, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  The reasons for the difference are as follows:

NOTE 11--COMMON STOCK:

         The holders of the Company's Class A Common Stock, voting as a
separate class, are entitled to elect 25% of the members of the Board of
Directors.  Holders of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, are
entitled to elect the remaining Directors, so long as the number of outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock is equal to at least 12.5% of the number of
outstanding shares of both classes of Common Stock as of the record date of the
Company's Annual Meeting.  If the number of outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock is less than 12.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of
both classes of Common Stock, the holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a
separate class, continue to elect a number of Directors equal to 25% of the
total number of Directors constituting the entire Board of Directors and the
remaining directors are elected by the holders of both classes of Common Stock,
with the holders of Class A Common stock having one vote per share and the
holders of Class B Common Stock having ten votes per share.  As of June 30,
1994, the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock constituted
10.4% (11.1% in 1993) of the total number of outstanding shares of both classes
of Common Stock.

         The Class A Common Stock has no conversion rights; however, Class B
Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.
In addition, no dividend in cash or property may be declared or paid on shares
of Class B Common Stock without a dividend being declared or paid on shares of
Class A Common Stock of at least 105% of that on the Class B Common Stock.
Dividends declared during the year ended June 30, 1992 totaled $197,000.

         In November, 1992, the Company sold 800,000 shares of its Class A
Common Stock, which were held as treasury stock at June 30, 1992, for $4.00 per
share.  Prior to that sale, these shares were registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, by means of a Registration Statement on Form S-2.  The
Company prepaid existing long-term indebtedness with the proceeds.

         The Company's stock repurchase program authorization for $4,000,000
for Class "A" Common Stock and 500,000 shares of Class "B" Common Stock was
increased to $5,000,000 for Class "A" Common Stock in July of 1994.  As of June
30, 1994, 880,356 shares of Class "A" Common Stock (826,056 in 1993) and
135,000 shares of Class B Common Stock (6,000) had been repurchased for
$4,724,000 ($3,663,000 in 1993) under this program.

*        A portion of the consideration received upon exercise of these options
         was 64,748 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.

         The 1990 Directors' Stock Option Plan provides for the granting, at
fair market value at the date of grant, of up to 100,000 shares of the
Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock as non-qualified stock options to
members of the Company's Board of Directors who are not employees ("Eligible
Directors") of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  Grants are made on the
third business day subsequent to each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including
the 1990 meeting, to each Eligible Director for 1,000 shares of Class A and
Class B Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of each such class
then outstanding.  Restrictions under the Directors' Stock Option Plan are
similar to those of the 1986 Stock Option Plan, as amended, except with regard
to the exercise date, which is twelve months after the date of grant, and
termination of options, which is generally nine months after termination of
service as a director.  During the year ended June 30, 1994, 3,556 and 444
(3,532 and 468 in 1993) shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock were granted
at exercise prices of $4.88 and $6.09, ($4.50 and $5.63 in 1993) respectively.
During fiscal 1993, 881 Class A and 119 of Class B options with option prices
of $4.75 and $5.94, respectively, were canceled.  At June 30, 1994, options for
10,695 and 1,305 shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock, respectively, were
exercisable at option prices between $3.75 to $5.94.

         On March 29, 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company granted stock
options to purchase 1,000 shares each of the Company's Class A Common Stock to
two non-employee Directors at $9.75 per share, which become exercisable the
same as options granted under the Company's 1986 Stock Option Plan and
terminate five years after the date of grant.  During the year ended June 30,
1994 these shares became exercisable.

         The amount of expense relating to the European pension plans is
determined based upon, among other things, the age, salary and years of service
of employees within the plans.  The Company's German, British, Swedish Amal AB
and Netherlands subsidiaries make annual contributions to the plans equal to
the amounts accrued for pension expense.

         In Germany, at Baldwin Gegenheimer GmbH, there is an additional
pension plan covering five employees, three of whom are retired.  This defined
benefit plan provides for benefits, at maturity age, in lump sum payments on
retirement or death or as a disability pension in case of disability.  This
plan is partially funded by insurance contracts.  In Sweden, at Misomex AB, (as
listed above), there are two defined benefit pension plans, one covering 21
retired employees and the other covering 122 employees, 65 of whom are retired.
The unfunded, but recorded, liability related to the Misomex AB plan at June
30, 1994 was $3,453,000 ($3,617,000 in 1993).  The recorded liability is
sufficient to cover obligations earned under the plan.

         There is one retirement plan within the Company's Asia Pacific Sector.
The Company's Japanese subsidiary maintains a non-contributory retirement plan
covering all employees, excluding directors (the "Japanese Retirement
Program").  Amounts expensed under the program are determined based on
participating employees' salary and length of service.  The Japanese Retirement
Program is fully accrued and partially funded through insurance contracts.
Expense relating to this program was $325,000, $296,000 and $118,000 for the
years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

         Officers and key employees of the Company participate in various
incentive compensation plans.  Amounts expensed under such plans were
$2,090,000, $2,367,000 and $1,209,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

         The Company adopted FAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions", as of July 1, 1992, the effect of which was
immaterial.

NOTE 15--RELATED PARTIES:

         On July 1, 1990, the Company, through each of it's subsidiaries,
Baldwin Americas Corporation (BAM), Baldwin Europe Consolidated Inc. (BEC) and
Baldwin Asia Pacific Corporation (BAP) entered into consulting agreements with
Polestar Limited ("Polestar"), a corporation wholly owned by Wendell M. Smith,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  The consulting agreements
have terms of one year, but are automatically extended for additional one-year
terms unless either party gives prior notice of termination.  Under the
consulting agreements, Polestar is obligated to provide certain management
services outside the United States and will receive compensation equal to 2% of
the annual consolidated after-tax profits of BAM, BEC and BAP and their
respective subsidiaries, in each case, not to exceed $150,000.  For the years
ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 the aggregate compensation expensed under
these agreements was $84,000, $147,000 and $86,000, respectively.

         On November 30, 1993, the Company entered into a loan and pledge
agreement and promissory note with Gerald A. Nathe, President and Director of
the Company and on March 11, 1994, the Company entered into loan and pledge
agreements and promissory notes with D. John Youngman, Vice President and
Director and William J. Lauricella, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of
the Company.  The loans were made in order to enable the Company's officers to
purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock from non-employee shareholders.
Mr. Nathe was loaned $1,817,321 to purchase 315,144 shares of the Company's
Common Stock and Mr. Youngman and Mr. Lauricella were each loaned $164,063 to
purchase 25,000 shares each of the Company's Common Stock.  All of the shares
purchased have been pledged as collateral for the demand promissory notes and
each of the notes are interest bearing, with interest payable on the
anniversary dates at LIBOR rates plus 1.25% reset on the first day of each
succeeding January, April, July and October.

         The Company employs the firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius as its legal
counsel.  Samuel B. Fortenbaugh III, a Director of the Company, is a partner in
this law firm.  In the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, the
Company incurred legal fees of approximately $252,000, $151,000, and $150,000,
respectively, payable to Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.

         On July 1, 1990, Baldwin Technology Corporation (BTC) and Baldwin
Graphic Systems, Inc. (BGS), two subsidiaries of BAM, entered into an agreement
with Harold W. Gegenheimer, Chairman Emeritus, guaranteed by the Company, to
replace various prior agreements including royalty and employment agreements,
retirement plans and bonus arrangements.  The new agreement guarantees a
compensation amount of $200,000 per year.  Simultaneously, a separate agreement
was made with Mr. Gegenheimer and the Company whereby the Company was released
from certain prior agreements, as noted above, and agreed to pay a minimum
guaranteed amount of compensation of $200,000 per year, not to exceed $350,000
per year, based on one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Company's annual net
after tax profits.  The amount expensed under these two agreements was $400,000
for each of the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992.

January 31, 1994



Mr. Gerald A. Nathe
11448 Bronzedale Drive
Oakton, VA  22124

Dear Mr. Nathe:

         This Agreement sets forth the terms of your employment with Baldwin
Technology Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and your
continued employment with Baldwin Americas Corporation, a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("BAM"), and is effective as of
August 5, 1993.

         1.      DUTIES.  During the term of your employment hereunder, you
shall be employed as the President of each of the Company and BAM, and you
shall direct and manage the business, affairs and property of the Company
subject to the direction of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the
"Chief Executive Officer") and the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board of Directors").

         2.      COMPENSATION.  As compensation for your services during the
term of your employment hereunder:

                 A.       Salary.  You shall be paid a salary at the annual
rate of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000) (hereinafter
referred to as your "base salary"), payable in appropriate installments to
conform with regular payroll dates for salaried personnel of the Company or
BAM.
<PAGE>   2
                 B.       Reviews and Adjustments.  As of July 1, 1994 and each
succeeding July 1 during the term of your employment hereunder, your
performance shall be reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and your
attainment of mutually agreed-upon objectives evaluated; your base salary for
the twelve (12) months beginning on such July 1 may be adjusted upward (but not
downward) by the Board of Directors, with some consideration made for the level
of inflation over the immediately preceding July 1.

                 C.       Incentive Compensation ("Bonus").  During the term of
your employment hereunder, and at such other times subsequent thereto as are
otherwise set forth herein, you shall be paid annually, within three (3) months
of the end of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30,
1994, incentive compensation equal to the aggregate of (i) one-half of one
percent (.5%) of the Company's net income after taxes (excluding extraordinary
items) for such fiscal year, as set forth in the Company's Consolidated and
Audited Statement of Income contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and as reported to
the Company's stockholders, plus (ii) an amount determined for such fiscal year
under the Company's or BAM's Executive & Key Person Bonus Plan (the "Bonus
Plan"), as in effect at that time; provided, however, that such incentive
compensation shall not exceed the product of two (2) times your base salary
under Paragraph 2A hereof for such fiscal year.

                 D.       Deferred Compensation.  You shall be paid, at such
times as are set forth in this Agreement, deferred compensation based upon an
amount equal to forty percent (40%) of your Final Average Pay (the "Deferred
Compensation").  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Final Average Pay"
shall mean an amount equal to (i) the total





                                      2
<PAGE>   3
of (a) the sum of the base salaries and incentive compensation paid to you with
respect to each of the two (2) fiscal years ending immediately preceding the
fiscal year in which you become entitled to the Deferred Compensation, plus (b)
the base salary and incentive compensation payable to you at the time that you
become entitled to the Deferred Compensation (annualized to twelve (12)
months), (ii) divided by three (3).  The annual amount of Deferred Compensation
payable to you under this Agreement shall not exceed one hundred seventy-five
thousand dollars ($175,000).  The amount equal to forty percent (40%) of your
Final Average Pay, when calculated, shall then be restated to a monthly amount
by dividing such amount by twelve (12) (the "Monthly Amount"), and the Monthly
Amount shall be paid monthly, to you or your estate, as the case may be,
beginning on the day set forth in this Agreement, for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) months or the period ending with the month of your death,
whichever is longer.  In this regard, if you die after the date on which you
first become entitled to payment of the Deferred Compensation, whether or not
the first payment of the Monthly Amount has been made, and prior to the payment
of the Monthly Amount for one hundred eighty (180) months, the Monthly Amount
shall be paid monthly for the balance of such one hundred eighty (180) month
period to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by you in writing to the
Company, or, if none are designated, to your estate.  There shall be no
Deferred Compensation payable unless and until you shall have served under this
Agreement for a period of five years; from the beginning of the sixth year
through the end of the tenth year of service under this Agreement, the amount
of Deferred Compensation shall vest in twenty percent (20%) annual increments
so that only after a full ten (10) years of service under this Agreement





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
shall the amount as set forth by formula above be due and payable, and then
only in certain instances as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

         3.      STOCK AND STOCK OPTIONS.

                 A.       Class A Stock.

                          (i)     The Company shall issue or transfer to you,
at such times when you have earned them and at no cost to you, a total of two
hundred thousand (200,000) shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share ("Class A Stock") in five (5) equal installments of forty
thousand (40,000) shares each.  You will be deemed to have earned the first
installment of forty thousand (40,000) shares of Class A Stock on a date (the
"First Installment Date") when (a) on or after the first anniversary of the
effective date of this Agreement (August 5, 1994), (b) the closing price of the
Class A Stock on the American Stock Exchange (the "Fair Market Value")
increases by two dollars ($2.00) per share over the price at which it traded on
the effective date of this Agreement ($3.875 per share); each subsequent
installment of Class A Stock shall similarly be deemed to be earned by you when
the Fair Market Value of the Class A Stock increases by an additional two
dollars ($2.00) per share over the Fair Market Value at which the previous
installment was earned.  A stock certificate for the Class A Stock so earned
shall be issued and delivered to you within fifteen (15) days of the date such
stock was deemed to be earned by you.

                          (ii)    In the event of a reorganization,
recapitalization, change of shares, stock split, spinoff, stock dividend,
reclassification, subdivision or combination of shares, merger, consolidation,
rights offering, or any other change in the corporate structure





                                       4
<PAGE>   5
or shares of capital stock of the Company, the number of shares and increase in
price of the Fair Market Value as stated in Paragraph 3A(i) hereof shall be
adjusted appropriately.

                          (iii)   With regard to each installment of the Class
A Stock issued under Paragraph 3A(i) hereof, the Company grants to you the
right to require the Company to include the Class A Stock issued to you in any
registration statement that the Company may file in the future (said right to
be known as the "Piggy-Back Registration Rights").  In the event the Company
does not file and cause to become effective a registration statement subsequent
to your earning each installment of the Class A Stock as outlined in Paragraph
3A(i) hereof on which you could have exercised your Piggy-Back Registration
Rights, the Company further grants to you a one-time right to demand that the
Company file and cause to become effective a registration statement for each
installment of the Class A Stock issued to you under Paragraph 3A(i) hereof, by
written notice to the Company (said right to be known as the "Demand
Registration Rights").  In the event you notify the Company of your exercise of
a Demand Registration Right, the Company shall use its best efforts to have a
registration statement with respect to the Class A Stock issued under Paragraph
3A(i) hereof prepared, filed and declared effective by the SEC as soon as
practicable.  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the
Company shall not be required to file a registration statement during the
period between (a) the date on which its financial statements for any fiscal
year become available and (b) the date on which it is required to file an
annual report with respect to such fiscal year on Form 10-K under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; provided, however, that the Company shall
during such period be required to continue to use its best efforts to prepare
such registration statement for filing





                                       5
<PAGE>   6
and to file such registration statement as soon as possible after the date
described in clause (b) above.  Your rights to exercise each of the Demand
Registration Rights shall expire, respectively, on or before the earlier of (a)
the date the Company files and causes to become effective a registration
statement on which you could have exercised your Piggy-Back Registration Rights
for each installment of Class A  Stock issued under Paragraph 3A(i) hereof, or
(b) three years after the date each installment of shares of the Class A Stock
is issued to you under Paragraph 3A(i) hereof.

                 B.       Class A Stock Options.  On August 5, 1993, the
Company granted to you a non-qualified stock option, pursuant to the Company's
1986 Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the "1986 Plan"), to purchase up

thousand three hundred twenty-one dollars and sixteen cents ($1,817,321.16)

interest, payable annually, at a rate equal to the Company's borrowing rate (as
adjusted quarterly) on its U.S. short-term banking facilities, (ii) require
pledging by you of the Class B Stock (until sold in part or in full as
described herein) and (iii) require repayment by you prior to the last day of

death.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph
3C, at any time that you sell any of the shares of Class B Stock while any
amount of the Loan remains unpaid, you shall, within five (5) days of receipt
of the funds from such sale, pay to the Company, in repayment of part or all,
as the case may be, of the Loan, an amount equal to $5.77 times the number of
shares of the Class B Stock so sold, but not in excess of the unpaid balance of
the Loan, plus interest, as set forth in this Paragraph 3C, on the amount so
repaid to the extent that such interest accrued to the date of such repayment.

         4.      LIFE INSURANCE.   During the term of your employment
hereunder, the Company, subject to your insurability, shall pay the premiums on
a contract or contracts of life insurance on your life in the aggregate amount
of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), which contract or contracts may be
owned by your spouse or such other party as may be designated by you.

         5.      REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.  In addition to the compensation
provided for herein, the Company shall reimburse to you, or pay directly, all
reasonable expenses incurred by you in connection with the business of the
Company, and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including but not limited to
business-class travel if overseas, reasonable accommodations, and

Company will require the presence of your spouse, and this Paragraph 5 applies
as well to such expenses relating to her.

                 F.       No Excess Parachute Payments  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company obtains a
written opinion of its tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") to the effect that there
exists a material possibility that any payment to which you would (but for the
application of this Paragraph 9F) be entitled under this Agreement, would (but
for such application) be treated as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Section 280G(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder):

                          (i)     Unless you and the Company agree to an
alternative amendment of this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of
Paragraph 9F(ii) hereof, this Agreement shall be amended by reducing the
payments to which you are entitled hereunder, in the order specified in the

opinion of Tax Counsel, there does not exist a material possibility that any
payment to which you are entitled under this Agreement (as so amended) will be
treated as an excess parachute payment; or





                                       18
<PAGE>   19
                          (ii)    If you and the Company agree to amend this
Agreement by modifying the amount and/or timing of the payments to which you
are entitled hereunder in a manner other than that specified in Paragraph 9F(i)
hereof, and if, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, there does not exist a material
possibility that any payment to which you are entitled under this Agreement (as
so amended) will be treated as an excess parachute payment, this Agreement
shall be so amended.

         An amendment to this Agreement pursuant to Paragraph 9F(i) hereof
shall reduce, first, the Deferred Compensation (and, concomitantly, the Monthly
Amount), second (if applicable), the amount payable under Paragraph 9A(i)(c)
hereof by virtue of your election under Paragraph 9D hereof to treat an event
described therein as constituting the termination of your employment, and
third, on a pro-rata basis, all other amounts (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof, which shall in any event be paid in full) to
which you are entitled hereunder.

<PAGE>   20
                                  (b)      Any amounts owing, but not yet paid,
pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof;

                          (ii)    A single lump sum payment of any accrued but
unpaid incentive compensation as set forth in Paragraph 2C hereof due to you at
the date of such termination for the fiscal year ending immediately prior to

provided in Paragraph 12 and Paragraph 13 hereof.

         10.     SOURCE OF PAYMENTS.  All payments provided for hereunder shall
be paid from the general funds of the Company.  The Company may, but shall not
be required to, make any investment or investments whatsoever, including the
purchase of a life insurance contract or contracts on your life, to provide it
with funds to satisfy its obligations





                                       20
<PAGE>   21
hereunder; provided, however, that neither you nor your beneficiary or
beneficiaries, nor any other person, shall have any right, title, or interest
whatsoever in or to any such investment or contracts.  If the Company shall
elect to purchase a life insurance contract or contracts on your life to
provide the Company with funds to satisfy its obligations hereunder, the
Company shall at all times be the sole and complete owner and beneficiary of
such contract or contracts, and shall have the unrestricted right to use all
amounts and to exercise all options and privileges thereunder without the
knowledge or consent of you, your beneficiary or beneficiaries, or any other
person, it being expressly agreed that neither you, any such beneficiary or
beneficiaries, nor any other person shall have any right, title, or interest
whatsoever in or to any such contract or contracts.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Paragraph 10, if the Company purchases any
such contract or contracts, you shall have the right, upon the termination of
your employment by the Company to purchase as soon after such termination as
possible any one or more of such contracts for an amount equal to the cash
surrender value thereof; provided, however, that you notify the Company in
writing of your intention to make any such purchase no later than thirty (30)
days subsequent to such termination.

         11.     ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS.  Nothing in this Agreement, and no
action taken pursuant to its terms, shall create or be construed to create a
trust or escrow account of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the
Company and you, your beneficiary or beneficiaries, or any other person.  You,
your beneficiary or beneficiaries, and any other person or persons claiming a
right to any payments or interests hereunder shall rely solely on the unsecured
promise of the Company, and nothing herein shall be construed to give





                                       21
<PAGE>   22
you,  your beneficiary or beneficiaries, or any other person or persons, any
right, title, interest, or claim in or to any specific asset, fund, reserve,
account, or property of any kind whatsoever owned by the Company or in which it
may have any right, title, or interest now or in the future, but you or your
beneficiary or beneficiaries shall have the right to enforce a claim for
benefits hereunder against the Company in the same manner as any unsecured
creditor.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Paragraph
11, the Company agrees to consider the feasibility of paying to a so-called
"rabbi trust," as described in the Internal Revenue Service's Revenue Procedure
92-64, the amounts necessary for the Company to fund the Deferred Compensation
set forth in Paragraph 2D hereof.

         12.     INVENTIONS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  So long as you shall
be employed by the Company or BAM, you agree promptly to make known to the
Company the existence of any and all creations, inventions, discoveries, and
improvements made or conceived by you, either solely or jointly with others,
during the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter, and to
assign to the Company the full exclusive right to any and all such creations,
inventions, discoveries, and improvements relating to any subject matter with
which the Company is now or shall become concerned, or relating to any other
subject matter if made with the use of the Company's time, materials, or
facilities.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, any of the foregoing
inventions shall be considered as "work-made-for-hire" and the Company shall be
the owner thereof.  You further agree, without charge to the Company but at its
expense, if requested to do so by the Company, to execute, acknowledge, and
deliver all papers, including applications or assignments for patents,
trademarks, and copyrights, and papers relating





                                       22
<PAGE>   23
thereto, as may be considered by the Company to be necessary or desirable to
obtain or assign to the Company any and all patents, trademarks, or copyrights
for any and all such creations, inventions, discoveries, and improvements in
any and all countries, and to vest title thereto in the Company in all such
creations, inventions, discoveries, and improvements as indicated above
conceived during your employment by the Company, and for three (3) years
thereafter.  You further agree that you will not disclose to any third person
any trade secrets or proprietary information of the Company, or use any trade
secrets or proprietary information of the Company in any manner, except in the
pursuit of your duties as an employee of the Company, and that you will return
to the Company all materials (whether originals or copies) containing any such
trade secrets or proprietary information  (in whatever medium) on termination
of your employment by the Company.  The obligations set forth in this Paragraph
12 shall survive the termination of your employment hereunder.  This Paragraph
12 replaces the agreement executed by you on January 5, 1993, which prior
agreement is now null and void.

         13.     RESTRICTIVE COVENANT.  For a period of three (3) years after
the termination of your employment by the Company, you shall not, in any
geographical location at which there is at that time business conducted by the
Company which was conducted by the Company at the date of such termination,
directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by,
participate in, or be connected in any manner with, the ownership, management,
operation, or control of any business similar to or competitive with such
business conducted by the Company without the written consent of the Company.

         14.     LEGAL FEE.  The Company shall reimburse to you, or pay
directly, upon submission in either event to the Company of a statement for
services, the amount payable by you to any attorney of your choice that you
have retained to advise you with regard to this Agreement; provided, however,
that such reimbursement or payment shall not exceed ten thousand dollars
($10,000).

         15.     ARBITRATION.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach or asserted breach thereof, shall be
settled by arbitration to be held in New York, New York in accordance with the
rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment
upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof.  The arbitrator shall determine which party shall bear the costs of
such arbitration, including attorneys' fees.

         16.     NON-ASSIGNABILITY.  Your rights and benefits hereunder are
personal to you, and shall not be alienated, voluntarily or involuntarily,
assigned or transferred.

         17.     BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto, and their respective assigns, successors, executors,
administrators, and heirs.  In the event the Company becomes a party to any
merger, consolidation, or reorganization, this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect as an obligation of the Company or its successors in interest.
None of the payments provided for by this Agreement shall be subject to seizure
for payment of any debts or judgments against you or your beneficiary or
beneficiaries, nor shall you or any such beneficiary or beneficiaries have any
right to transfer or encumber any right or benefit hereunder; provided,
however, that the undistributed





                                       24
<PAGE>   25
portion of the Deferred Compensation shall at all times be subject to set-off
by the Company for debts owed by you to the Company.

         18.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement contains the entire
agreement relating to your employment by the Company and BAM.  It may not be
changed orally,  and may be changed only by an agreement in writing signed by
the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification,
extension, deletion or revocation is sought.

         19.     NOTICES.  All notices and communications hereunder shall be in
writing, sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid; by facsimile transmission, time and date of receipt noted
thereon; or by hand-delivery properly receipted. The actual date of receipt as
shown by the receipt therefor shall determine the time at which notice was

postage prepaid, or, at your election, shall be transferred to you
electronically to such bank as you designate in writing to the Company,
including designation of the applicable electronic address.  The foregoing
items (other than any electronic transfer to you) shall be addressed as follows

time to time):

         4.      PREPAYMENT; SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL.  The Notes may be
prepaid only under the circumstances set forth in PARAGRAPHS 4A and 4D and
shall be repaid in accordance with PARAGRAPH 4C or upon any acceleration of
final maturity as provided in PARAGRAPH 7.

         4A.     OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT WITH MAKE WHOLE PREMIUM.  The Borrowers
shall have the option of prepaying the Notes at any time or from time to time
in whole or in part (in minimum amounts of $1,000,000 or larger amounts which
are integral multiples of $250,000), at 100% of the principal amount so
prepaid, plus interest accrued thereon to the Settlement Date and the Make
Whole Premium, if any.  All partial prepayment(s) of the Notes pursuant to this
PARAGRAPH 4A shall be applied to the obligations of the Borrowers to make the
mandatory repayments of principal required in PARAGRAPH 4C below in inverse
order of maturity.

         4B.     NOTICE OF OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT.  The Borrowers shall give each
Holder to be prepaid in whole or in part pursuant to PARAGRAPH 4A irrevocable
written notice of such prepayment at least 30 days prior to the Settlement
Date, specifying (i) the Settlement Date and (ii) the Called Principal of the
Notes held by each such Holder, and stating that such prepayment is an optional
prepayment pursuant to PARAGRAPH 4A of this Agreement.  Upon the giving of such
notice, the Called Principal as specified in such notice, together with
interest thereon to the Settlement Date and the Make Whole Premium, if any,
shall become due and payable on the Settlement Date.  On the date which is two
(2) Business Days prior to the Settlement Date of a prepayment under PARAGRAPH
4A, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Holder of each Note being prepaid an
Officers' Certificate stating whether a Make Whole Premium is payable in
connection with such prepayment and setting forth in detail the calculations
used in making such determination.

         4C.     SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL.  The Borrowers shall,
beginning October 29, 1997 and on each October 29th thereafter until October
29, 1999, repay $6,250,000 of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, each
at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid plus interest accrued thereon to the
date of payment.  On October 29, 2000, all remaining principal and accrued
interest then outstanding under the Notes shall be repaid in full.

         4D.     PREPAYMENT UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL.  The Borrowers shall give
prompt written notice (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE") to each Holder not less
than 30 days prior to the effective date of any Change of Control which
requires or has received the approval of the Company's stockholders or Board of
Directors.  The Change of Control Notice shall identify the Persons involved,
describe the transaction, include such financial and other information as is
available to the Company and the Borrowers with





                                      -3-
<PAGE>   8
reasonable effort that shall be reasonably necessary to each Holder to make an
informed decision as to whether to elect to require prepayment and set forth
the effective date of such proposed Change of Control.  Any Holder, by giving
written notice of such election not later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the stated effective date of such Change of Control, shall have the option to
require the Borrowers to prepay all, but not less than all, of its Notes at
100% of the principal amount thereof plus interest accrued thereon to the
Settlement Date and the Make Whole Premium, if any.  Any such prepayment shall
be made on the effective date of the Change of Control.

         If the proposed terms of a proposed Change of Control change
substantially, the Borrowers shall deliver to each Holder a revised Change of
Control Notice which includes the information required above and each Holder
shall then have another opportunity to elect to require prepayment of its Notes
(by delivering to the Borrowers written notice of such election not later than
ten (10) days following receipt of such revised Change of Control Notice), and
any such prepayment shall occur on the later to occur of (a) the effective date
of such Change of Control or (b) three (3) Business Days following the
Borrowers' receipt of the Holders election to require repayment.

         On the date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the Settlement
Date of a prepayment under this PARAGRAPH 4D, the Borrowers shall deliver to
the Holder of each Note being prepaid an Officers' Certificate stating whether
a Make Whole Premium is payable in connection with such prepayment and setting
forth in detail the calculations used in making such determination.

         If the Borrowers fail to give proper notice of a Change of Control or
if a Change of Control occurs with respect to which the Borrowers were not
obligated to give prior notice, then, without limitation of any other rights
the Holders may have by reason thereof under this Agreement, any Holder whose
Notes were not prepaid in connection with such Change of Control may at any
time thereafter or, if the Borrowers give a Change of Control Notice after a
Change of Control has occurred, not later than thirty (30) days following the
date that the Borrowers gave such Change of Control Notice, require the
Borrowers to prepay in full the aggregate principal amount of its Notes at 100%
of the principal amount so prepaid plus accrued interest to the Settlement Date
and the Make Whole Premium, if any.

         4E.     APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.  Upon any partial prepayment of the
Notes pursuant to PARAGRAPH 4A and any scheduled repayment of the Notes
pursuant to PARAGRAPH 4C, the principal amount so prepaid plus the interest
accrued thereon and the Make Whole Premium, if any, shall be allocated to all
Notes at the time outstanding in proportion to their respective outstanding
principal amounts.  All payments made to the Holders on account of the Notes
shall be applied first to expenses, then to accrued interest (including accrued
interest on interest and on the Make Whole Premium, if any), then to the Make
Whole Premium, if any, and then to principal.

         4F.     RETIREMENT OF NOTES.  The Company and the Borrowers shall not,
and shall not permit any of their Affiliates to, prepay or otherwise retire in
whole or in part prior to their stated maturity (other than by prepayment
pursuant to PARAGRAPH 4A or 4D, scheduled repayment pursuant to PARAGRAPH 4C or
upon acceleration of such final maturity pursuant to PARAGRAPH 7A), or purchase
or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, Notes held by any Holder unless
the Company, such Borrower or such Affiliate shall have offered to prepay or
otherwise retire or purchase or otherwise acquire, as the case may be, the same
proportion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by each other Holder
at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions.  No Notes so
prepaid or otherwise retired or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company,
either Borrower or any their Affiliates shall thereafter be reissued or deemed
to be outstanding for any purpose under this Agreement.

         4G.     MAKE WHOLE PREMIUM.  The Borrowers acknowledge that the Make
Whole Premium due at any optional prepayment or prepayment upon a Change of
Control or upon acceleration of final maturity





                                      -4-

return on the Notes and is not a penalty.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>   10
         condition or event existed or exists, specifying the nature and period

                 (iv)     together with each delivery of financial statements
         of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to SUBPARAGRAPH (II) of
         this PARAGRAPH 5A, a certificate by the Company's independent public
         accountants stating (a) that their audit examination has included a
         review of the terms of this Agreement and the Notes as they relate to
         accounting matters and that such review is sufficient to enable them
         to make the statement referred to in CLAUSE (C) of this SUBPARAGRAPH
         (IV), (b) whether, in the course of their audit examination, there has
         been disclosed the existence during the fiscal year covered by such
         financial statements (and whether they have knowledge of the existence
         as of the date of such accountants' certificate) of any condition or
         event which constitutes a Default or Event of Default under PARAGRAPH
         6A, 6B, 6C (other than PARAGRAPHS 6C(1) and 6C(6)), or 6D, and if
         during their audit examination there has been disclosed (or if they
         have knowledge of) such a condition or event, specifying the nature
         and period of existence thereof (it being understood, however, that
         such accountants shall not be liable to any Person by reason of their
         failure to obtain knowledge of any Default or Event of Default which
         would not be disclosed in the course of an audit conducted in
         accordance with generally accepted auditing standards), and (c) that
         based on their annual examination nothing came to their attention
         which causes them to believe that the information contained in the
         certificate of the Company's chief financial officer delivered
         pursuant to SUBPARAGRAPH (III) of this PARAGRAPH 5A insofar as it
         relates to accounting or auditing matters is not correct or that the
         matters set forth in such certificate are not stated in accordance
         with the terms of this Agreement (it being understood that such
         independent public accountants' examination was not primarily directed
         toward determining the accuracy of such information);

                 (v)      promptly after receipt thereof by the Company or
         either Borrower, copies of all material reports submitted to the
         Company or such Borrower by independent public accountants and
         consultants in connection with each annual, interim or special audit
         of the books of the Company or any Significant Subsidiaries made by

         civil penalty could be assessed pursuant to section 502(i) of ERISA or
         a tax imposed by section 4975 of the Code, terminate or withdraw from
         any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) in a manner, or take any
         other action with respect to any such Plan (including, without
         limitation, a substantial cessation of business operations or an
         amendment of a Plan within the meaning of section 4041(e) of ERISA),
         which could result in any liability of the Company or either Borrower
         or any Related Person to the PBGC, to a Plan, to a Plan participant,
         to the Department of Labor or to a trustee appointed under section
         4042(b) or (c) of ERISA), incur any liability to the PBGC or a Plan on

         contributions thereto, or permit to exist any accumulated funding
         deficiency, whether or not waived, with respect to any Plan (other
         than a Multiemployer Plan);

             (ii)         at any time permit the termination of any defined
         benefit pension plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) and

         exceed the then current value of all assets in such plan;

            (iii)         if the Company, either Borrower or any Related Person
         becomes obligated under a Multiemployer Plan, permit the aggregate
         complete or partial withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with
         respect to Multiemployer Plans incurred by the Company, either
         Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries or any Related Person or the
         aggregate liability under Title IV of ERISA incurred by the Company or
         its Subsidiaries or any Related Person to exceed any amount the

been incurred less any portion thereof as to which the Company reasonably
believes, after appropriate consideration of possible adjustments arising under
subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, neither it, nor either Borrower, nor any of
their Subsidiaries nor any Related Person will have any liability, provided
that the Company shall obtain promptly written advice from independent
actuarial consultants supporting such determination.  Upon the request of any
Holder, the Company will request and obtain a current statement of withdrawal
liability from each Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, either Borrower or
any Related Person is or has been obligated to contribute and (y) transmit a
copy of such statement to each Holder, within 15 days after the Company
receives the same.

meaning specified in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code, the
terms "present value" and "current value" have the meanings specified in
section 3 of ERISA, the term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in
section

                 (ii)     the Borrowers default in the payment of any interest
         of any Note when the same shall become due, either by the terms
         thereof or otherwise as provided in this Agreement and such default
         shall continue for five (5) days thereafter; or

                 (iii)    the Company, either Borrower or any of their
         Subsidiaries defaults (whether as primary obligor or guarantor or

         on any Debt other than that evidenced by the Notes beyond any period
         of grace provided with respect thereto, the outstanding principal
         amount of which Debt exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate, or fails to
         perform or observe any other agreement, term or condition contained in
         any agreement under which any such Debt is created (or if any other
         event thereunder or under any such agreement shall occur and be
         continuing), and the effect of such failure or other event is to
         cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such Debt (or a trustee
         on behalf of such holder or holders) to cause, such Debt to become due
         or be repurchased prior to any stated maturity unless prior to any
         acceleration of the Notes on account of such default, failure or other
         event, the Company, either Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case
         may be, shall have obtained the written waiver of such default,
         failure or other event by the holders of such Debt in respect of which
         such default, failure or other event shall have occurred and shall
         have delivered a copy of the same to each Holder; or

                 (iv)     any representation or warranty made by the Company or
         the Borrowers in this Agreement or in any writing furnished in
         connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be false in any
         material respect on the date as of which made; or

                 (vi)     the Company, either Borrower or any of their
         Subsidiaries fails to perform or observe any other agreement, term or
         condition of this Agreement, or the Company, either Borrower, or any
         Affiliate Guarantor fails to perform any provision of the Contribution

such Holder may determine in its sole discretion.  No remedy conferred in this
Agreement or the Notes upon any Holder is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.  No failure or delay by any Holder
in





                                      -19-
<PAGE>   24
exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or under the Notes or any
other document executed in connection therewith shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy
preclude any other right or remedy hereunder or thereunder.

 8.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  The Company and the Borrowers represent
and warrant that:

         8A.     ORGANIZATION, ETC.  The Company and BAM are corporations duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, BTL is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Bermuda, each of the Company's other Subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated as set forth in SCHEDULE 8A, and the
Company, each Borrower and each of their Subsidiaries has the corporate power
and authority to own, operate and lease its respective property and to carry on
its respective business as now being conducted.  The Company, each Borrower and
each of their Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign
corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the failure
to do so would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant
Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.  Each of the Borrowers, BEC and BAP are
Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of the Company.  SCHEDULE 8A sets forth the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company's Subsidiaries (other than the
Borrowers) and each jurisdiction in which the Company, each Borrower or any of
their Subsidiaries is authorized to do business as a foreign corporation.  This
Agreement, the Notes, the Contribution Agreement and any Subordination
Agreement to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Borrowers and, when executed and delivered
by the Borrowers, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Borrowers, and, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other laws affecting the enforcement or priority of creditors' rights
generally, now or hereafter in effect, and subject to the provision that
equitable remedies shall be within the discretion of the court having
jurisdiction to exercise the same, are enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms.   This Agreement (with respect to the Company) and the
Related Agreements to which the Company, any Affiliate Guarantor or any other
Subsidiary of the Company is party have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, such Affiliate Guarantor or such
other Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, when executed and delivered by the
Company, such Affiliate Guarantor or such other Subsidiary, as the case may be,
will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, such
Affiliate Guarantor and such other Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
the enforcement or priority of creditors' rights generally, now or hereafter in
effect, and subject to the provision that equitable remedies shall be within
the discretion of the court having jurisdiction to exercise the same, are
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.  There are no
Subsidiaries of the Company or either Borrower in existence as of the date
hereof other than those listed in SCHEDULE 8A.  All of the outstanding capital
stock of the Company is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

         8B.     BUSINESS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The Company has furnished
each Purchaser with (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of June 30 in each of the years 1988 through 1993 and the
related consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity
and of cash flows and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash
flows for the periods of twelve months ended on each such date; (ii) the
unaudited Balance Sheet of BAM as of June 30 in each of the years 1991 through
1993 and (iii) the unaudited Balance Sheet of BTL as of October 28, 1993.  The

schedules and/or notes (the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"), are true and correct in
all material respects, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and show all
liabilities of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including BAM and
BTL) required to be shown therein accordance with GAAP.  The balance sheets
included in the Financial Statements fairly present the condition of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including BAM), of BAM and of BTL,
as the case may be, as at the dates thereof, and the statements of income, of
changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows included in the Financial
Statements fairly present the results of the operations, the





                                      -20-
<PAGE>   25
changes in shareholders' equity and the cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (including BAM) for the periods indicated.  The
Company has furnished each Purchaser with each filing or report filed with the
SEC under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act in respect of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1993.  There has been no change which has had a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group
since June 30, 1993.

         8C.     ACTIONS PENDING.  Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 8C, there is
no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, either Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, threatened against
the Company, either Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, or any properties or
rights of the Company, either Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, by or
before any court, arbitrator or administrative or governmental body which might
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or
the Consolidated Group, or impairs either Borrower's ability to perform this
Agreement, the Notes, the Contribution Agreement or any Subordination Agreement
to which it is a party, the Company's ability to perform this Agreement or the
Related Agreements to which it is a party or any Affiliate Guarantor's or any
of the Company's other Subsidiaries' ability to perform the Related Agreements
to which it is a party.

         8D.     TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  Each of the Company, the Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries has good title to its respective real properties (other than
properties which it leases) and good title to all of its other respective
properties and assets, including the properties and assets reflected in the
balance sheets as of June 30, 1993 included in the Financial Statements (other
than properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business),
subject to no Lien of any kind except Liens permitted by PARAGRAPH 6C(1).  All
leases necessary in any material respect for the conduct of the respective
businesses of the Company, the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries are valid and
subsisting and are in full force and effect.  As of the date of this Agreement,
all of the outstanding capital stock of the Borrowers and each of the
Subsidiaries listed in SCHEDULE 8A is validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and is 100% owned directly or indirectly by the Company or, if
not, is owned by the Persons and in the amounts listed on SCHEDULE 8A, which
Persons collectively own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of such Borrower and each such Subsidiary, and all such capital stock
owned by the Company, either Borrower or their Subsidiaries and is owned free
and clear of any Lien of any kind and the Company, such Borrower or such other
Subsidiary has the right, subject only to limitations imposed by applicable law
to receive dividends and distributions on such capital stock.

         8E.     TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS.  Each of the Company, the Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries has filed all Federal, State, local and foreign income
tax returns, franchise tax returns, real and personal property tax returns and
other tax returns required by law to be filed by or on behalf of them or with
respect to their respective properties or assets other than those which the
failure to file in the aggregate do not and will not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group,
and all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon any of
the Company, the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries and any of their respective
properties, assets, income or franchises which are due and payable have been
paid, other than those presently payable without penalty or interest, those
presently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently
conducted and for which such reserves or other appropriate provisions, if any,
as may be required by GAAP have been made and those which in the aggregate with
all other unpaid taxes, assessment and governmental charges do not and will not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or
the Consolidated Group.

         8F.     CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS.  None of the
Company, the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries is in violation of any term
of its charter or by-laws, or in breach of any term of any agreement (including
any agreement with stockholders), instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute,
law, rule or regulation to which it is subject, the consequences of which
violation or breach are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group or impair
either Borrower's ability to perform this Agreement, the Notes, the
Contribution Agreement or any Subordination Agreement to which it is a party,
the Company's ability to perform this Agreement or the





                                      -21-
<PAGE>   26
Related Agreements to which it is a party or any Affiliate Guarantor's or any
of the Company's other Subsidiaries' ability to perform the Related Agreements
to which it is a party.  None of the Company, the Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or subject to any charter
or other corporate restriction which has a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.  Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the Related Agreements,
nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes, nor fulfillment of nor
compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Notes and the
Related Agreements, will conflict with the provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company, either Borrower or
any of their Subsidiaries pursuant to, its charter or by-laws, any award of any
arbitrator or any agreement (including any agreement with stockholders),
instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which
it is subject.  None of the Company, the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries
is a party to, or otherwise subject to any provision contained in, any
instrument evidencing Debt, any agreement relating thereto or any other
contract or agreement (including its charter) which limits the amount of, or
otherwise imposes restrictions on the incurring of, the Funded Debt to be
evidenced by the Notes and the Affiliate Guaranties.

         8G.     OFFERING OF NOTES.  None of the Company or the Borrowers nor
any agent acting on their behalf has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes
or any similar security of the Company or either Borrower for sale to, or
solicited any offers to buy the Notes or any similar security of the Company or
either Borrower from, or otherwise approached or negotiated with respect
thereto with, any Person other than 30 Institutional Investors, and none of the
Company or the Borrowers nor any agent acting on their behalf has taken or will
take any action which would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the
provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act or to the registration provisions
of any securities or Blue Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.  Upon
issuance of the Notes, the Notes will not be of the same class as any
securities of either Borrower listed on a national securities exchange
registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act or quoted in a U.S. automated
inter-dealer quotation system, within the meaning of Rule 144A.

         8H.     REGULATION G, ETC.  None of the Company, the Borrowers or any
of their Subsidiaries owns or has any present intention of acquiring any
"margin stock" as defined in Regulation G (12 CFR Part 207) of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (herein called "margin stock").  None
of the proceeds of the sale of the Notes will be used, directly or indirectly,
for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of purchasing or
carrying any margin stock or for the purpose of maintaining, reducing or
retiring any indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry
any stock that is currently a margin stock or for any other purpose which might
constitute this transaction a "purpose credit" within the meaning of such
Regulation G.  Neither of the Company or either Borrower nor any agent acting
on their behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this
Agreement or the Notes to violate Regulation G, Regulation T, Regulation U,
Regulation X or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or
as the same may hereafter be in effect.

         8I.     ERISA.

                 (a)      To the knowledge of the Company and the Borrowers,
neither the Company nor any Related Person has breached any of the fiduciary
rules of ERISA or engaged in any prohibited transaction in connection with
which the Company or any Related Person could be subjected to (in the case of
any such breach) a suit for damages or (in the case of any such prohibited
transaction), either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 502(i) of
ERISA, a tax imposed under section 4975 of the Code or a lien imposed under
section 412(n) of the Code, in any such case which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated
Group.

                 (b)      No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or any trust
created under any such Plan has been terminated since September 2, 1974 other
than any such Plan or trust, the termination of which did





                                      -22-
<PAGE>   27
not or would not give rise to a liability which had or would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated
Group.  Neither the Company nor any Related Person has within the past six
years contributed, or had any obligation to contribute, to a single employer
plan that has at least two contributing sponsors not under common control or
ceased operations at a facility under circumstances which could result in
liability under the Code or ERISA which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.  No
liability to the PBGC has been or is expected by the Company or any Related
Person to be incurred with respect to any Plan by the Company or any Related
Person which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any
Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.  There has been no reportable
event (within the meaning of section 4043(b) of ERISA) or any other event or
condition with respect to any Plan which presents a risk of termination of any
such Plan by the PBGC under circumstances which in any case would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group.

                 (c)      Except to the extent the failure to do so would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or
the Consolidated Group, (i) full payment has been made (or will be made within
the period described in section 412 of the Code) of all amounts which the
Company or any Related Person is required under the terms of each Plan to have
paid as contributions to such Plan as of the last day of the most recent fiscal
year of such Plan ended prior to the date hereof (or will be made within the
period described in section 404 of the Code), (ii) no accumulated funding
deficiency (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived, exists with respect to any Plan, and (iii) each Plan
satisfies the minimum funding standard of section 412 of the Code.

                 (d)      (i) Neither the Company nor any Related Person has
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, the withdrawal from
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant
Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group, and (ii) neither the Company nor any
Related Person has been notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan to
which the Company or any Related Person is obligated or has been obligated to
contribute that such Multiemployer Plan has been terminated or is in
reorganization and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be in
reorganization or to be terminated if such reorganization or termination would
result in a liability which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

                 (e)      Neither the Company nor any Related Person has, or is
expected to incur, any liability for post retirement benefits under any and all
welfare benefit plans (as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA), whether written or
unwritten, which are or have been established or maintained, or to which
contributions are or have been made, by the Company or any Related Person which
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary
or the Consolidated Group.

                 (f)      Neither the Company nor any Related Person has
engaged in any transaction that could result in the incurrence of any
liabilities under section 4069 or section 4212 of ERISA which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group.

                 (g)      The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
issuance and sale of the Notes will not involve any transaction which is
subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which
a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.  The
representation by the Company in the preceding sentence is made in reliance
upon and subject to the accuracy of each Purchaser's representation in
PARAGRAPH 9(II) as to the source of the funds to be used to pay the purchase
price of the Notes to be purchased by it.  With respect to any Plan identified
in writing to the Company in accordance with CLAUSE (E) of PARAGRAPH 9(II),
neither the Company nor any "affiliate" (as defined in Section V(c) of PTE
84-14) is described in the proviso of such CLAUSE (E).  The Company is neither
a "party in interest" (as defined in Title I, Section 3(14) of ERISA, nor a
"disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4915(e)(2) of the Code, with
respect to any Plan identified pursuant to PARAGRAPH 9(II)(E) or (F).

         8J.     GOVERNMENTAL CONSENT.  Neither the nature of the Company,
either Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
businesses or properties, nor any relationship between the Company, the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the Related Agreements, or the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
any action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental body in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Related Agreements and the offering, issuance, sale or

                                   ARTICLE II

                           REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

         2.1.    COMMITMENT.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Lender severally agrees to make Advances to the Borrowers from
time to time from the Closing Date until, but not including, the Revolving
Credit Termination Date on a pro rata basis as to the total borrowing requested
by the Borrowers on any day determined by such Lender's Applicable Commitment
Percentage up to but not exceeding the Revolving Loan Commitment of such
Lender; provided, however, that the Lender will not be required and shall have
no obligation to make any Advance (i) so long as a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or (ii) if the Agent has accelerated the
maturity of the Revolving Credit Notes as a result of an Event of Default or
(iii) if the Borrowers have not furnished to the Agent the Borrowing Base
Certificate required pursuant to Section 7.1(m) hereof; provided further,
however, that immediately after giving effect to each Advance, the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Loans shall not exceed the lesser of: (a) the
Total Commitment less the Unavailable Commitment Amount (without duplication)
and (b) the Borrowing Base (as set forth on the Borrowing Base Certificate most
recently delivered to the Agent  pursuant to Section 7.1(m) hereof or
otherwise).  Within such limits, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow
hereunder, on any Business Day from the Closing Date until, but (as to
borrowings and reborrowings) not including, the Revolving Credit Termination
Date; provided, however, that (x) no LIBOR Loan shall be made less than one
month before the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) each LIBOR Loan
may, subject to the provisions of Section 2.5, be repaid only on the last day
of the Interest Period with respect thereto (except as permitted by Section
2.10(c) hereof).  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Loans exceeds the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment less the Unavailable
Commitment Amount (without duplication) and (ii) the Borrowing Base, each
Borrower, jointly and severally, shall immediately reduce the outstanding
principal balance of the Loans to the extent of such excess, together with
accrued and unpaid interest on the amounts prepaid and payment of all sums
payable by any Borrower as set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.

         2.2.    AMOUNTS.  Each Advance made hereunder and conversions under
Section 2.11 shall be in an amount of at least $750,000 or





                                       24
<PAGE>   33
such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof
or in an amount equal to the entire difference of the Total Commitment less the
aggregate principal amount of Loans then outstanding.

         2.3.    ADVANCES.

                 (a)      Each Advance shall be, at the option of the Borrowers
specified in the Borrowing Notice furnished to the Agent pursuant to subsection
2.3(b) hereof, either a Prime Loan or a LIBOR Loan, which shall in each case be
made or maintained by each Lender at its Principal Office.  Not more than five
(5) Prime Loans and five (5) LIBOR Loans may be outstanding at the same time.

                 (b)      An Authorized Officer shall give the Agent (1) at
least three (3) LIBOR Business Days' irrevocable telephonic notice of each
Advance that will be a LIBOR Loan prior to 11:00 A.M., Charlotte, North
Carolina time; or (2) irrevocable telephonic notice of each Advance that will
be a Prime Loan prior to 11:00 A.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the day
of such proposed Prime Loan (each such notice referred to in subpart (1) and
(2) being referred to as a "Borrowing Notice").  Each such Borrowing Notice,
which shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent, shall specify the amount of
the borrowing, the type (Prime or LIBOR) of Loan, the date of borrowing and, if
a LIBOR Loan, the Interest Period to be used in the computation of interest.
An Authorized Officer shall provide the Agent written confirmation of each such
telephonic notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D and incorporated
herein by reference with appropriate insertions, but failure to provide such
confirmation shall not affect the validity of such telephonic notice.  Notice
of receipt of such Borrowing Notice shall be provided by the Agent to each
Lender by telephone with reasonable promptness, but not later than 1:00 P.M.,
Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the same day as Agent's receipt of such
telephonic notice.  The Agent shall provide each Lender written confirmation of
such telephonic confirmation, but failure to provide such notice shall not
affect the validity of such telephonic notice.

                 (c)      Not later than 3:00 P.M., Charlotte, North Carolina
time, on the date specified for each borrowing under this Article II, each
Lender shall, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, make the amount of the Advance or Advances to be made by it on
such day available to the Agent, by depositing or transferring the proceeds
thereof in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Principal Office.
The amount so received by the Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, be made available to the Borrowers by depositing the
proceeds thereof in Dollars and in immediately available funds in the
Borrowers' Account.

         2.4.    PAYMENT OF INTEREST.

                 (a)      Each Borrower, jointly and severally, shall pay
interest to the Agent at the Principal Office for the account of each Lender on
the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Lender
for the period commencing on the date of such Loan until such Loan shall be due
at the then applicable Prime Rate for Prime Loans or LIBOR Rate for LIBOR
Loans, as designated by an Authorized Officer pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof
or as otherwise provided herein; provided, however, that if any amount shall
not be paid when due (at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such amount
shall bear interest thereafter (1) in the case of a LIBOR Loan, until the end
of the current Interest Period with respect to such LIBOR Loan, at a rate of
two percent (2%) above such LIBOR Rate or the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law, whichever is lower and (2) after the end of such Interest
Period, and at all such times with respect to Prime Loans, at a rate of
interest per annum which shall be two percent (2%) above the Prime Rate or the
maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, from the date
such amount was due and payable until the date such amount is paid in full.

                 (b)      Interest on each LIBOR Loan shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and calculated for the actual number of days
elapsed.  Interest on each Prime Loan shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 365 days and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed.  Interest on
each Loan shall be paid (1) quarterly in arrears on each December 31, March 31,
June 30 and September 30 beginning December 31, 1993 and continuing through and
including the Revolving Credit Termination Date with respect to any Prime Loan
outstanding during such quarter, (2) on the last day of the applicable Interest
Period for each LIBOR Loan, provided that if such Interest Period extends for
six months, interest shall also be paid on the day three months after the first
day of such Interest Period, and (3) upon payment in full of the principal
amount of such Loan.  Payments of interest with respect to each LIBOR Loan
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall consist of accrued and unpaid interest
on the applicable LIBOR Loan from and including the first day of the Interest
Period applicable to such LIBOR Loan (or, in the case of the payment of
interest on the last day of an Interest Period of six months for a LIBOR Loan,
from and including the date of prior payment of interest on such LIBOR Loan
during such Interest Period) to but excluding the date of payment.  Payments of
interest with respect to each Prime Loan pursuant to the second preceding
sentence shall consist of accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Prime
Loan from and including the first day such Prime Loan is outstanding to but
excluding either the date of payment or conversion of such Prime Loan.





                                       26
<PAGE>   35
                 (c)      Promptly after the determination of any interest rate
provided for herein or any change therein, the Agent shall give notice thereof
to the Borrowers.

         2.5.    PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL.

                 (a)      The principal amount of each Loan shall be due and
payable in full on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.  Each Borrower,
jointly and severally, shall be responsible for each such principal amount.

                 (b)      Each payment of principal (including any prepayment)
of any Loan shall be made in an amount of at least $750,000 or such greater
amount which is an integral multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof or in an
amount equal to the entire outstanding principal balance of such Loan to the
Agent at the Principal Office, for the account of each Lender's applicable
Lending Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds before 3:00 P.M.,
Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the date such payment is due.  Dollar
payments received by the Agent after such time shall be deemed received on the
next succeeding Business Day.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to,
debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to any
ordinary deposit account of the Borrowers with the Agent.  Any Borrower shall
endeavor to give the Agent prior telephonic notice of any payment of principal,
such notice to be given by not later than 11:00 A.M., Charlotte, North Carolina
time, on the date of such payment.

                 (c)      The Agent shall deem any payment by or on behalf of
the Borrowers hereunder that is not made both (1) in Dollars and in immediately
available funds and (2) prior to 3:00 P.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time
(other than if such payment is made by a debit by the Agent to an account of
any Borrower therewith), to be a non-conforming payment.  Any such payment
shall not be deemed to be received by the Agent until the time such funds
become available funds, provided that in the case of a nonconforming payment
described in clause (2) above such payment shall be deemed received on the next
succeeding Business Day.  The Agent shall give prompt telephonic notice to the
Borrowers and each of the Lenders (confirmed in writing) if any payment is
non-conforming.

                 (d)      In the event that any payment hereunder or under the
Notes becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, then, subject
to the restrictions set forth in clause (ii) of the definition of "Interest
Period," such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day;
provided that interest shall continue to accrue during the period of any such
extension.





                                       27
<PAGE>   36
         2.6.    USE OF PROCEEDS.  The proceeds of the Loans made pursuant to 
the Revolving Credit Facility shall be used by the Borrowers and their 
Subsidiaries to finance working capital needs, for the repayment of any debt 
obligations of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries existing on the date of 
this Agreement and for general corporate purposes of the Borrowers.

         2.7.    NOTES.  All Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by, 
and be repayable with interest, jointly and severally by each Borrower, in
accordance with the terms of, a promissory note payable to the order of such
Lender in the amount of its Applicable Commitment Percentage of the Total
Commitment, which Note shall be dated the Closing Date or such later date
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance and shall be duly completed, executed
and delivered by each Borrower.  Each Lender is hereby authorized to record the
date and amount of each Loan made by such Lender, and the date and amount of
each payment of principal thereof, on such Lender's internal books and records
and then attach such information as a schedule to its Note, provided that the
failure of any Lender so to record any such information (or any error in such
recordation) shall not affect the Obligations of any Borrower with respect to
such Loan.

         2.8.    PRO RATA PAYMENTS.  Except as otherwise provided herein, (a) 
each payment by any Borrower on account of the principal of and interest on the
Loans and fees (other than the Agent's fees payable under Section 10.11 hereof,
which shall be retained by the Agent) described in this Agreement shall be made
to the Agent for the account of the Lenders pro rata based on their Applicable
Commitment Percentages (other than with respect to a "deficiency advance" under
Section 2.13), (b) all payments to be made by any Borrower for the account of
each of the Lenders on account of principal, interest and fees, shall be made
without set-off or counterclaim, and (c) the Agent will promptly distribute
payments received to the Lenders entitled thereto.

         2.9.    VOLUNTARY REDUCTION IN COMMITMENT.  The Borrowers shall have 
the right from time to time, upon not less than three (3) Business Days written
notice signed by all of the Borrowers to the Agent, to reduce the Total
Commitment.  The Agent shall give each Lender, within one (1) Business Day,
telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) of such reduction.  Each such
reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $750,000 or such greater amount
which is in an integral multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof, or such lesser
amount as shall constitute the Total Commitment then existing as a result of
any one or more previous reductions thereof, and shall permanently reduce the
Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender pro rata.  No such reduction shall
result in the payment  of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period of such Loan (except as permitted by Section 2.10(c)).  Each
reduction of the Total Commitment shall





                                       28
<PAGE>   37
be accompanied by payment of the Notes, jointly and severally by the Borrowers,
to the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Loans
exceeds the Total Commitment after giving effect to such reduction, together
with accrued and unpaid interest on the amounts prepaid and payment of all sums
payable by any Borrower as set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.

         2.10.    PREPAYMENT OF LOANS.  Each Borrower shall have the right from
time to time to prepay all or a portion of outstanding principal balance under
the Loans, (a) without penalty at any time with respect to Prime Loans, (b)
without penalty at the end of the applicable Interest Period with respect to
LIBOR Loans and (c) prior to the end of the applicable Interest Period with
respect to LIBOR Loans upon receipt by the Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders entitled thereto, of all sums payable by any Borrower as set forth in
Section 3.4 hereof.

         2.11.    CONVERSIONS AND ELECTIONS OF INTEREST PERIODS.  The duration 
of the initial Interest Period for each LIBOR Loan shall be as specified in the
Borrowing Notice.  Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and subject to the limitations set forth below and in Sections
3.1(b), 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5(b) hereof, the Borrowers may on three (3) LIBOR
Business Days' notice to the Agent on or before 11:00 A.M. Charlotte, North
Carolina time:

                 (a)      elect a subsequent Interest Period for all or a
portion of the outstanding LIBOR Loans to begin on the last day of the Interest
Period for such LIBOR Loans;

                 (b)      convert all or a portion of the outstanding LIBOR
Loans to Prime Loans on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR
Loans; and

                 (c)      convert all or a portion of the outstanding Prime 
Loans to LIBOR Loans on any date.

         Notice of any such elections or conversions shall specify the
effective date of such election or conversion and the Interest Period to be
applicable to the LIBOR Loan as continued or converted.  Each election and
conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be binding on all of the
Borrowers and shall be subject to the limitations on LIBOR Loans set forth in
the  definition of "Interest Period" herein and in Sections 2.1, 2.2  and 2.3
hereof.  If the Agent does not receive a notice of election of duration of an
Interest Period or to convert an outstanding LIBOR Loan by the time prescribed
above, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loan
to a Prime Loan on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan.
All such continuations or conversions of Loans





                                       29
<PAGE>   38
shall be effected pro rata based on the Applicable Commitment Percentages of
the Lenders.

         2.12. FEES.

                 (a)      For the period beginning on the date of each Lender's
commitment hereunder and ending on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the
Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata
benefit of the Lenders based on their Applicable Commitment Percentages, an
unused commitment fee for such period equal to the sum of: (i) the amount
determined by applying a rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per annum to
the amount by which the average daily amount during such period of the Total
Fee Baseline exceeds the sum of the average daily amount during such period of
outstanding Loans to all Borrowers, plus (ii) the amount determined by applying
a rate of one-fourth of one percent (.25%) per annum to the average daily
Unavailable Commitment Amount during such period.  Such payments of fees
provided for in this Section 2.12(a) shall be due in arrears on each December
31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 beginning December 31, 1993 and
continuing through and including the Revolving Credit Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limitation of or prejudice to any
other right or remedy available to the Borrower by contract or at law, so long
as any Lender fails to make available any portion of its Revolving Loan
Commitment when requested, such Lender shall not be entitled to receive payment
of its pro rata share of such fee until such Lender shall make available such
portion.

                 (b)      The Borrowers have agreed to pay to NationsBank a
structuring fee as set forth in that Letter Agreement of even date herewith by
and between the Borrowers and NationsBank.

         2.13.    DEFICIENCY ADVANCES.  No Lender shall be responsible for any
default of any other Lender in respect to such other Lender's obligation to
make any Loan hereunder nor shall the Revolving Loan Commitment of any Lender
hereunder be increased as a result of such default of any other Lender.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event any Lender shall
fail to advance funds to the Borrowers as herein provided, NationsBank may in
its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, advance under the Note in its
favor as a Lender all or any portion of such amount (the "deficiency advance")
and shall thereafter be entitled to payments of principal of and interest on
such deficiency advance in the same manner and at the same interest rate or
rates to which such other Lender would have been entitled had it made such
advance under its Note; provided that, upon payment to NationsBank from such
other Lender of the entire outstanding amount of such deficiency advance,
together with interest thereon, from the most recent date or dates interest was





                                       30
<PAGE>   39
paid to NationsBank by any Borrower on each Loan comprising the deficiency
advance at the Federal Funds Effective Rate, then such payment shall be
credited against the Note of NationsBank in full payment of such deficiency
advance and the Borrowers shall be deemed to have borrowed the amount of such
deficiency advance from such other Lender as of the most recent date or dates,
as the case may be, upon which any payments of interest were made by any
Borrower thereon.

         2.14.    UNAVAILABLE COMMITMENT AMOUNT; REDUCTION IN COMMITMENT.  The
Total Commitment shall be reduced from time to time by an amount (the
"Unavailable Commitment Amount") equal to: (I) the aggregate amount of all then
outstanding Indebtedness for Money Borrowed (other than Existing Capitalized
Leases) of each Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, Sector Subsidiary, Subsidiary of
a Sector Subsidiary and any other Baldwin Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness
under the Senior Note Documents), less (II) $10,000,000; provided that the
Unavailable Commitment Amount shall not be less than $0.

         2.15.    AUTHORITY TO DEBIT BORROWER ACCOUNT. To the extent the Agent 
is entitled to withdraw any amount from the Borrower Account pursuant to any 
Loan Document, each Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to debit such amount 
from the Borrower Account even if it is maintained with a Person other than the
Agent.


                                  ARTICLE III

                        YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.1.    ADDITIONAL COSTS.

                 (a)      Each Borrower, jointly and severally, shall promptly
pay to the Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time, following
delivery of the written explanation required under Section 3.1(c), such amounts
as such Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate it for
any material costs incurred by such Lender which it determines are attributable
to its making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or its obligation to make any LIBOR
Loans, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this
Agreement or the Notes in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or such
obligation, including reductions in the rate of return on a Lender's capital
(such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable and returns being
herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:
(1) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under
this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans (other than
changes in respect of taxes imposed on or measured by the income of such Lender
or





                                       31
<PAGE>   40
of its applicable Lending Office by any jurisdiction in which the Lender is
subject to tax and other than changes for which (and only to the extent that)
the Lender may obtain a foreign tax credit or similar offset or tax benefit);
or (2) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, or similar
requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any
deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender (other than the Reserve
Requirement or any other such reserve, deposit or requirement reflected in the
LIBOR Rate, computed in accordance with the definition of such term set forth
in Section 1.1 hereof); or (3) has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on capital of any such Lender to a level below that which the
Lender could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy); or (4)
imposes any other condition, not involving a change in the basis of taxation,
adversely affecting such Lender under this Agreement or the Notes.  Each Lender
will notify the Borrowers of any event occurring after the Closing Date which
would entitle it to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) as promptly as
practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such
compensation.

                 (b)      Without limiting the effect of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.1, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory
Change, any Lender either (1) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by
the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or
other liabilities of such Lender which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or
a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which
includes LIBOR Loans or (2) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of
such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such
Lender so elects by notice to the other Lenders, the Agent and the Borrowers,
the obligation of such Lender to make, and to convert Prime Loans into, LIBOR
Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the date such Regulatory Change ceases
to be in effect and the Borrowers shall, on the last day(s) of the then current
Interest Period(s) for outstanding LIBOR Loans, convert such LIBOR Loans into
Prime Loans, in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof.

                 (c)      Each Lender will notify the Borrowers of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such Lender to
compensation under Section 3.1 as promptly as practicable; provided, however,
that each Lender will designate a different Lending Office for the Loans of
such Lender affected by such event or by the matters requiring compensation
pursuant to Section 3.4, and take other measures, if such designation or other
measures will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
and will not result in a material cost to, or be otherwise disadvantageous to,
such Lender in its





                                       32
<PAGE>   41
determination.  Determinations by any Lender for purposes of this Section 3.1
of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of making or maintaining,
or being committed to make, Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of
Loans, and of the additional amounts required to compensate the Lender in
respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.
The Lender requesting such compensation shall upon request furnish to the
Borrowers a written explanation of the Regulatory Change and calculations, in
reasonable detail, and setting forth such Lender's determination of any such
Additional Costs.

                 (d)      Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws
of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver
to the Borrowers and the Agent, at the time of its entering into this Agreement
and, in any event, prior to any Person making any payment to such Lender
hereunder, (1) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Service Form 1001 or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, or
other manner of certification, establishing that payments of interest, fees and
other amounts hereunder are either not subject to or totally exempt from United
States Federal withholding tax and (2) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9 or successor applicable form.  Each such Lender also agrees to deliver to
the Borrowers and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224
and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrowers,
unless in any such case a Regulatory Change has occurred prior to the date on
which any such delivery would otherwise be required and such Regulatory Change
in and of itself (that is, not as a result of a change in Lending Office or
other action on the part of the Lender) prevents such Lender from duly
completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so
advises each of the Borrowers and the Agent.  Such Lender shall certify (1) in
the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that it is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes and (2) in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to
an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.  Any failure by the
Lender to comply with this Section 3.1(d) or Section 11.1(f) shall, without
limitation, preclude such Lender from obtaining payment from the Borrowers of
any additional costs under Section 3.1(a) to the extent such additional costs
are proximately caused by such failure to comply.

         3.2.    SUSPENSION OF LOANS.  Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any





                                       33
<PAGE>   42
interest rate for any LIBOR Loan for any Interest Period therefor, the Agent
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error)
that:

                 (a)      quotations of interest rates for the relevant
deposits referred to in the definition of "Base Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof are
not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for
purposes of determining the rate of interest for such LIBOR Loan as provided in
this Agreement; or

                 (b)      the relevant rates of interest referred to in the
definition of "Base Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof upon the basis of which the
LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period is to be determined do not adequately
reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan for
such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrowers prompt notice thereof, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to
make LIBOR Loans or to convert Prime Loans into LIBOR Loans, and the Borrowers
shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
outstanding LIBOR Loans convert such LIBOR Loans into Prime Loans, if available
hereunder, in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof.  The Agent shall give the
Borrowers notice describing in reasonable detail any event or condition
described in this Section 3.2 promptly following the Agent's determination that
the availability of LIBOR Loans is, or is to be, suspended as a result thereof.

         3.3.    ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender to honor its
obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrowers thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such
Lender's obligation to make or continue LIBOR Loans, or convert Prime Loans
into LIBOR Loans, shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again
make and maintain LIBOR Loans, and such Lender's outstanding LIBOR Loans shall
be converted into Prime Loans in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof or, in the
event such Lender's outstanding LIBOR Loans must be converted into Prime Loans
prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, such Lender's
outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be so converted at such time, provided that each
Borrower, jointly and severally, shall be obligated to pay such Lender such
amounts as may otherwise be required pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof in such
instance.

         3.4.    COMPENSATION.  Each Borrower, jointly and severally, shall
promptly pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of
such Lender through the Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient
(in the reasonable determination





                                       34
<PAGE>   43
of Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or out-of-pocket expense
incurred by it as a result of:

                 (a)      any payment, prepayment or conversion of a LIBOR
Loan, including without limitation in connection with any reduction in the
Total Commitment pursuant to Sections 2.9, 2.14 or 2.15 hereof, on a date other
than the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan; or

                 (b)      any failure by the Borrowers to borrow a LIBOR Loan
on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant Borrowing Notice under
Section 2.3 hereof;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (1) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
principal amount so paid, prepaid, converted, not borrowed or reduced for the
period from the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion, failure to borrow
or reduction to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan
(or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan
which would have commenced on the date scheduled for such borrowing) at the
applicable rate of interest for such LIBOR Loan provided for herein minus the
LIBOR Interest Addition for such Loan over (2) the interest component of the
amount such Lender would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar
deposits of leading banks of amounts comparable to such principal amount and
maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such Lender).
A determination of a Lender as to the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
3.4 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.  The Lender requesting
compensation under this Section 3.4 shall furnish to the Borrowers upon written
request written calculations in reasonable detail setting forth such Lender's
determination of the amount of such compensation.

         3.5.    SUBSTITUTION OF LOANS.  If (a) the obligation of any Lender to
make, continue or convert a Prime Loan into a LIBOR Loan has been suspended
pursuant to Section 3.1(b), 3.2 or 3.3 hereof, or (b) any Lender has required
payment of compensation under Section 3.1(a) and the Borrowers have elected
upon five LIBOR Business Days prior written notice signed by all of the
Borrowers to the Agent that this Section 3.5 shall be applicable, then in
either event, unless and until the Borrowers have been notified that the
circumstances resulting in such suspension or compensation no longer exist or
are no longer applicable, all Loans which otherwise would have been so made,
continued or converted shall be made or continued as Prime Loans by such
Lender, and all payments of interest and principal thereon shall be made by the
Borrowers on such dates as if such Prime Loans had been made as, remained or
converted into LIBOR Loans.

In the case of each Advance hereunder (other than the initial Advance if such

representation and warranty by the Borrower on the date of such Advance as to

4.2.

                                   ARTICLE V

relevant stockholder to pledge and deliver to the Agent, all issued and

the issued and outstanding stock of such Subsidiary) (in each case, pursuant to
a pledge agreement substantially similar to the form of the Baldwin Pledge
Agreement, to be executed by Baldwin at such time) together with stock powers
executed in blank.

         (c)  The Lenders are and will be unwilling to make any Advances to any
Borrower after the date of acquisition or formation of any such Subsidiary (or
after Enkel International owns any assets, or if Baldwin Asia Pacific Ltd. is
not a direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary of BAP at the time specified above)
unless and until the respective guaranty and pledge agreement required by
subsection (a) or (b) above have been executed and delivered to the Agent,

shares giving rise to the obligation of a Sector Subsidiary or other Baldwin
Subsidiary to execute such a guaranty or pledge agreement, unless and until
such guaranty or pledge agreement has been executed and delivered to the Agent,

expense execute, deliver and file and re-file and record and re-record or
cause to be filed and re-filed and recorded and re-recorded all instruments
deemed necessary or advisable by the Agent to be filed and re-filed and
recorded or re-recorded and shall continue or cause to be continued the Liens

Obligations shall be outstanding and until the Revolving Credit Termination
Date.

         5.6. FURTHER ASSURANCES.  At the request of the Agent, the Borrowers
will execute by their duly authorized officers, alone or with the Agent, any
certificate, instrument, statement or document and will procure any such
certificate, instrument, statement or document (and pay all connected costs)
which the Agent reasonably deems necessary to create or preserve the Liens (and
the perfection and priority thereof) of the Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Borrower and Baldwin represents and warrants (which

have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of such
Borrower and, when executed and delivered by such Borrower, will constitute

to which Baldwin, any Sector Subsidiary, any BAM Subsidiary or any BTL
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and when executed and delivered by Baldwin,
such Sector Subsidiary, such BAM Subsidiary, or such BTL Subsidiary, as the
case may be, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Baldwin,
such Sector Subsidiary, such BAM Subsidiary, or such BTL Subsidiary, as the
case may be, and, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other laws affecting the enforcement or priority of creditors' rights
generally, now or hereafter in effect, and subject to the provision that

jurisdiction to exercise the same, are enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms.  There are no Subsidiaries of Baldwin or any Borrower in
existence as of the Closing Date other than those listed in Schedule 6.1.  As
of the Closing Date, neither Baldwin nor any Borrower owns any equity interest
in any Person other than the Persons set out in Schedule 6.1.  All of the
outstanding capital stock of Baldwin is validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable.

         6.2.    BUSINESS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  Baldwin has furnished the
Agent and each Lender with (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of Baldwin
and its Subsidiaries as of June 30 in each of the years 1988 through 1993 and
the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders'
equity and of cash flows and, as applicable, changes in financial position or
cash flows for the periods of twelve months ended on each such date; (ii) the
unaudited compiled balance sheet of BAM as of June 30 in each of the years 1990
through 1993 together with a compilation report with respect to the balance
sheet of BAM as of June 30, 1993, such report to be issued by the same
independent certified public accountants that prepared the audited balance
sheet of Baldwin and its Subsidiaries for the year ended June 30, 1993; and
(iii) the unaudited balance sheet of BTL as of October 28, 1993.  The financial
statements referred to in this paragraph 6.2 including any related schedules
and/or notes (the "Financial Statements"), are true and correct in all material
respects, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and show all liabilities
of Baldwin and its consolidated Subsidiaries (and in the case of the balance
sheet of BAM, all liabilities of BAM) required to be shown therein accordance
with GAAP.  The balance sheets included in the Financial Statements fairly
present the condition of Baldwin and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including
BAM), of BAM and of BTL, as the case may be, as at the dates thereof, and the
statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows
included in the Financial Statements fairly present the results of the
operations, the changes in shareholders' equity and the cash flows of Baldwin
and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including BAM) for the periods indicated.
Baldwin has furnished the Agent and each Lender with each filing or report
filed with the SEC under Section 13 or

15(d) of the Exchange Act in respect of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.
There has been no change or event which has had a Material Adverse Effect on
Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group since June 30,
1993.

         6.3. ACTIONS PENDING.  Except as disclosed in Schedule 6.3, there is
no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
any Borrower or any Borrower Subsidiary, threatened against Baldwin, any
Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of Baldwin,
any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, by or before any court, arbitrator
or administrative or governmental body which might have a Material Adverse
Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group, or
impair any Borrower's ability to perform this Agreement, the Notes, the
Borrowers Pledge Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party,
Baldwin's ability to perform the Baldwin Guaranty or any other Loan Document
Agreement to which it is a party or any Guarantor's ability to perform any
Guaranty, Pledge Agreement or other Loan Documents to which it is a party.
There are no actions or proceedings filed or pending or (to the best knowledge
of each Borrower) investigations pending or threatened against Baldwin, any
Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries which questions the validity or legality
or seeks damages in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document or any action taken or to be taken with respect to any of the
foregoing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         6.4. TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  Each of Baldwin, the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries has good title to its respective real properties (other than
properties which it leases) and good title to all of its other respective
properties and assets, including the properties and assets reflected in the
balance sheets as of June 30, 1993 included in the Financial Statements (other
than properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business),
subject to no Lien of any kind except Liens permitted by Section 8.3(a).  All
leases necessary in any material respect for the conduct of the respective
businesses of Baldwin, the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries are valid and
subsisting and are in full force and effect.  As of the date of this Agreement,
all of the outstanding capital stock of the Borrowers, each of the Sector
Subsidiaries, each of the BAM Subsidiaries, and each of the other Baldwin
Subsidiaries listed in Schedule 6.1 is validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, is owned by the Persons and in the amounts listed on Schedule
6.1, which Persons collectively own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of such Borrower and each such Subsidiary, and all such
capital stock owned by Baldwin, any Borrower or their Subsidiaries is owned
free and clear of any Lien of any kind and Baldwin, such Borrower or such other
Subsidiary has the right,





                                       44
<PAGE>   53
                                                                         

subject only to limitations imposed by applicable law to receive dividends and
distributions on such capital stock.

         6.5. TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS.  Each of Baldwin, the Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries has filed all Federal, State, local and foreign income tax
returns, franchise tax returns, real and personal property tax returns and
other tax returns required by law to be filed by or on behalf of them or with
respect to their respective properties or assets other than those which the
failure to file in the aggregate do not and will not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group, and
all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon any of
Baldwin, the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties, assets, income or franchises which are due and payable have been
paid, other than those presently payable without penalty or interest, those
presently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently
conducted and for which such reserves or other appropriate provisions, if any,
as may be required by GAAP have been made and those which in the aggregate with
all other unpaid taxes, assessments and governmental charges do not and will
not have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or
the Consolidated Group.

         6.6. CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS.  None of Baldwin, the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries is in violation of any term of its
charter or by-laws, or in breach of any term of any agreement (including any
agreement with stockholders), instrument, indenture, order, judgment, decree,
statute, law, rule or regulation to which it is subject, the consequences of
which violation or breach are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group or
impair any Borrower's ability to perform this Agreement, the Notes, the
Borrowers Pledge Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party,
Baldwin's ability to perform the Baldwin Guaranty or the other Loan Documents
to which it is a party or any Guarantor's ability to perform any Guaranty,
Pledge Agreement or other Loan Document to which it is a party.  None of
Baldwin, the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries is a party to any contract
or agreement or subject to any charter or other corporate restriction which has
a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group.  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Notes and the Loan Documents, nor fulfillment of nor compliance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, the Notes and the Loan Documents, will
conflict with the provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in
any violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Baldwin, any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries
pursuant to, its charter or bylaws, any award of any arbitrator or any
agreement (including





                                       45
<PAGE>   54
                                                                         

any agreement with stockholders), instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute,
law, rule or regulation to which it is subject.  None of Baldwin, the Borrowers
or any of their Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise subject to any
provision contained in, any instrument evidencing Indebtedness, any agreement
relating thereto or any other contract or agreement (including its charter)
which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the incurring
of, the Funded Debt to be evidenced by the Notes.

         6.7. ERISA.

                 (a)  To the best of each Borrower's knowledge, neither Baldwin
nor any Borrower nor any Related Person has breached any of the fiduciary rules
of ERISA or engaged in any prohibited transaction in connection with which
Baldwin, any Borrower or any Related Person could be subjected to (in the case
of any such breach) a suit for damages or (in the case of any such prohibited
transaction), either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 502(i) of
ERISA, a tax imposed under such section 4975 of the Code or a lien imposed
under section 412(n) of the Code, in any such case which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated
Group.

                 (b)      No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or any trust
created under any such Plan has been terminated since September 2, 1974 which
termination may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.  Neither Baldwin
nor any Borrower nor any Related Person has within the past six years
contributed, or had any obligation to contribute, to a single employer plan
that has at least two contributing sponsors not under common control or ceased
operations at a facility under circumstances which could result in liability
under the Code or ERISA that may reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated
Group.  No liability to the PBGC has been or is expected by Baldwin, any
Borrower or any Related Person to be incurred with respect to any Plan by
Baldwin, any Borrower or any Related Person which may reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group.  There has been no reportable event (within the meaning of
section 4043(b) of ERISA) or any other event or condition with respect to any
Plan which presents a risk of termination of any such Plan by the PBGC under
circumstances which in any case could result in liability which may reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant
Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

                 (c)      Except to the extent failure to do so would not
result in liability which may reasonably be expected to have a





                                       46
<PAGE>   55
                                                                         

Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group,  (i) full payment has been made (or will be made within the
period described in section 412 of the Code) of all amounts which Baldwin, any
Borrower or any Related Person is required under the terms of each Plan to have
paid as contributions to such Plan as of the last day of the most recent fiscal
year of such Plan ended prior to the date hereof (or will be made within the
period described in section 404 of the Code), (ii) no accumulated funding
deficiency (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived, exists with respect to any Plan, and (iii) each Plan
satisfies the minimum funding standard of section 412 of the Code.

                 (d)      (i) neither Baldwin nor any Borrower nor any Related
Person has been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan the
withdrawal from which has given rise or could give rise to liability that may
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any
Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group, and (iii) neither Baldwin nor
any Borrower nor any Related Person has been notified by the sponsor of a
Multiemployer Plan to which Baldwin, any Borrower or any Related Person is
obligated or has been obligated to contribute that such Multiemployer Plan has
been terminated or is in reorganization and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably
expected to be in reorganization or to be terminated if such reorganization or
termination could result in liability which may reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group.

                 (e)      Neither Baldwin nor any Borrower nor any Related
Person has, or is expected to incur, any liability for post retirement benefits
under any and all welfare benefit plans (as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA),
whether written or unwritten, which are or have been established or maintained,
or to which contributions are or have been made, by Baldwin, any Borrower or
any Related Person which may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

                 (f)      Neither Baldwin nor any Borrower nor any Related
Person has engaged in any transaction that could result in the incurrence of
any liabilities under section 4069 or section 4212 of ERISA which may
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any
Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

                 (g)      The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making of the Loans will not involve any transaction which is subject to the
prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be
imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.  The foregoing representation in
this paragraph





                                       47
<PAGE>   56
                                                                         

(g) is made in reliance upon the representation and warranty of the Lenders set
forth in section 11.10 hereof.

         6.8. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  Each of Baldwin, the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries has obtained all permits, licenses and other authorizations that
are required and is in compliance with all terms and conditions of all permits,
licenses, and other authorizations required to be obtained by it under all
applicable Environmental Laws, and is also in compliance with all other
applicable limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions,
requirements, obligations, schedules, and timetables contained in any
Environmental Laws or in any regulation, ordinance, code, plan, order, decree,
judgment, injunction, notice, or demand letter issued, entered, promulgated, or
approved thereunder, except to the extent that failure so to comply does not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any Borrower or any of their
Subsidiaries.  The Borrowers and Baldwin are not aware of any prior use of any
of the owned or leased properties of Baldwin, the Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries by any Person, that constitutes a violation of any Environmental
Laws, except to the extent that such violation does not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Baldwin, any Borrower, or any of their Subsidiaries.  Neither any
Borrower  nor Baldwin is aware of any event, condition, or activity which may
interfere with or prevent continued compliance by Baldwin, the Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries with all Environmental Laws, except to the extent that
failure so to continue to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effective on
Baldwin, Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries.

         6.9. LABOR RELATIONS.  There is not now pending, nor to the
knowledge of any Borrower or any Borrower Subsidiary threatened, any strike,
work stoppage, work slow-down, or material grievance or other dispute between
Baldwin, any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries and any bargaining unit or
significant number of its respective employees.

         6.10. DISCLOSURE.  Neither this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan
Documents nor any other document, certificate or statement furnished to the
Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of Baldwin, any Borrower or any Guarantor
in connection herewith contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that, an Event of Default shall not occur
solely because the Borrowers inadvertently include among the Eligible Accounts
referred to in any Borrowing Base Certificate an Account that fails to be an
Eligible Account because it is subject to a Lien (of which no Borrower has
knowledge or notice) or the inventory, goods, property, services or
consideration of which such Account





                                       48
<PAGE>   57
                                                                         

constitutes proceeds is subject to any Lien (of which no Borrower has knowledge
or notice); provided further, in each case, upon any Borrower obtaining
knowledge or receiving notice that any such Account is not an Eligible Account,
the Borrowers shall promptly notify the Agent and the Lenders and shall
promptly deliver to the Agent a corrected Borrowing Base Certificate with such
Account removed from the Eligible Accounts.  There is no fact peculiar to
Baldwin, any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries which has a Material Adverse
Effect on Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group and
which has not been set forth in this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan
Documents or in other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Agent and the Lenders by or on behalf of Baldwin, any Borrower or any Guarantor
prior to the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

         6.11. STATUS UNDER CERTAIN FEDERAL STATUTES.  Neither Baldwin nor any
Borrower nor any of their Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" or a
company "controlled" by an "investment company" or an "open-end investment
company" or a "unit investment trust" or a "face-amount certificate company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (b) a
"holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an
"affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended, or (c) a "carrier", as defined in section 11,301(a)(1) of
Title 49 of the United States Code and subject to the provision of such Title.
Neither Baldwin nor any Borrower nor any of their Subsidiaries is a "national
of any designated foreign country", within the meaning of the Foreign Assets
Control Regulations or the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of the United
States Treasury Department, 31 C.F.R., Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended, or
any regulations or rulings issued thereunder.  Neither the making of the Loans
nor the use of such proceeds by the Borrowers as required by this Agreement
will violate the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, the Foreign Funds Control
Regulations, the Transaction Control Regulations, the Cuban Assets Control
Regulations, the Iranian Assets Control Regulations, the Libyan Sanctions
Regulations, the Iranian Transactions Regulations, the Iraqi Sanctions
Regulations, the Haitian Transactions Regulations, or any other regulations of
the U.S. Treasury Department (as set forth in 31 C.F.R., Subtitle B, Chapter V,
as amended), or any of Executive Orders 12,722, 12,724, 12,808 and 12,810 of
the President of the United States.

         6.12. MARGIN STOCK.  Neither Baldwin nor any Borrower nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries is engaged principally in, or has as one of its
important activities, the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any





                                       49
<PAGE>   58
                                                                         

"margin stock" as such terms is defined in Regulation U, as amended (12 C.F.R.
Part 221), of the Board.  The proceeds of the borrowings made pursuant to
Section 2.1 hereof will be used by the Borrowers only for the purposes set
forth in Section 2.6 hereof.  None of such proceeds will be used by any
Borrower or any Borrower Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the purpose of reducing or
retiring any Indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry
margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute any of the Loans
under this Agreement a "purpose credit" within the meaning of said Regulation U
or Regulation X (12 C.F.R. Part 224) of the Board.  Neither any Borrower nor
any agent authorized to act, and acting, in its behalf (other than the other
parties to this Agreement) has taken or will take any action which would cause
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents to violate any regulation of the
Board or to violate the Exchange Act or any state securities laws, in each case
as in effect on the date hereof.

         6.13. NO CONSENTS, ETC.  Neither the respective businesses or
properties of Baldwin, any Borrower, any Borrower Subsidiary, any Sector
Subsidiary or any Baldwin Subsidiary nor any relationship between Baldwin, any
Borrower, any Borrower Subsidiary, any Sector Subsidiary or any of Baldwin
Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby is such as to require a consent, approval or authorization
of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental or other
authority or any other Person on the part of Baldwin, any Borrower, any
Borrower Subsidiary, any Sector Subsidiary or any Baldwin Subsidiary as a
condition to the execution, delivery and performance of, or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
except where such consent, approval, authorization, filing, registration or
qualification has been obtained or effected, or will be obtained or effected in
the ordinary course or where the failure to obtain or effect the same could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin, any
Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

         6.14. SOLVENCY.  Baldwin, each Borrower, each Guarantor, and each of
their Subsidiaries is Solvent after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         6.15. RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS.  Except as set forth in this
Agreement, there are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary to pay
dividends to Baldwin or any Borrower.

         6.16. NO SENIOR OR EQUAL DEBT.  Neither Baldwin nor any Borrower, nor
any Borrower Subsidiary nor any Sector Subsidiary is directly or indirectly
liable with respect to (i) any Indebtedness that is senior to the Obligations,
or (ii) any Indebtedness for Money Borrowed (other than the Existing
Capitalized Leases and other than the Indebtedness under the Senior Note
Documents) that ranks equal to or pari passus with the Obligations.

         6.17. SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.  Each Borrower
covenants, warrants and represents to the Agent that all representations and
warranties of the Borrowers contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance hereof and
thereof by the parties hereto and thereto and the closing of the transactions
described herein or related hereto and any investigation at any time made by or
on behalf of the Agent shall not diminish the Agent's right to reply thereon.

the fiscal period covered by such financial statements and that such review has
not disclosed the existence during or at the end of such fiscal period, and
that to the best of his knowledge after reasonable investigation the signer has
no knowledge of the existence as at the date of such certificate, of any
condition or event which constitutes a Default or Event of Default or, if any
such condition or event existed or exists, specifying the nature and period of
existence thereof and what action Baldwin and the Borrowers have taken, are
taking or propose to take with respect thereto and (ii) Baldwin, the Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries are in compliance with the provisions of Sections 8.1,
8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 hereof and (B) demonstrating (with computations in reasonable
detail) compliance by Baldwin, the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries with the

reason of their failure to obtain knowledge of any Default or Event of Default
which would not be disclosed in the course of an audit conducted in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards), and (iii) that based on their
annual examination nothing came to their attention which causes them to believe
that the information contained in the certificate of Baldwin's and each
Borrower's chief financial officer delivered pursuant to subparagraph (c) of
this Section 7.1 insofar as it relates to accounting or auditing matters is not
correct or that the matters set forth in such certificate are not stated in

                 outstanding is not increased, the Lien is not extended to
                 other property and the Indebtedness secured thereby would be
                 permitted under Section 8.4;

                 actions or proceedings promptly instituted and diligently
                 conducted and such reserves as shall be required by GAAP shall
                 have been made therefor and which in the aggregate do not

                 giving pro forma effect to such purchase or acquisition as if

                 completed Fiscal Quarter for which financial statements were
                 delivered pursuant to Section 6.1, such 80% Subsidiary would

                 Subsidiaries may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of some
                 or all of its properties or assets for such consideration as
                 may be determined to be fair and adequate by the Board of
                 Directors of Baldwin, such Borrower or such Subsidiary (a
                 "Disposition"); provided, however, that (A) no Default or
                 Event of Default exists immediately before or immediately
                 after and giving effect to such Disposition or would otherwise

                 be, of all such properties and assets so sold by Baldwin, the
                 Borrowers and their Subsidiaries (which, in the case of a sale
                 of capital stock of a Subsidiary, shall equal the seller's
                 share of the aggregate book value of the properties and assets
                 of such Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries, calculated on a
                 consolidated basis) ("Assets Sold") during the then current
                 Fiscal Year, (less the aggregate amount of Qualifying
                 Reinvestments then made by Baldwin, the Borrowers and their
                 Subsidiaries during such Fiscal Year,) does not exceed 10% of
                 Consolidated Net Tangible Assets at the end of the Fiscal Year
                 immediately preceding such Disposition; and

                          (vi)  Baldwin, any Borrower or any of their
                 Subsidiaries may sell inventory in the ordinary course of
                 business and Baldwin Japan Limited, a wholly-owned Subsidiary
                 of Baldwin Asia Pacific Corporation, may sell receivables in

         as set forth in this Agreement, enter into, or be otherwise subject
         to, any contract or agreement (including its charter) which limits the
         amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the payment of,
         dividends by any of the Baldwin Subsidiaries or Borrower Subsidiaries
         or distributions on any other securities of any of the Baldwin
         Subsidiaries or Borrower Subsidiaries held by any Borrower, any

         (including, without limitation, the purchase, sale or exchange of

         services rendered) with any present or former stockholder (other than
         Persons who do not own and have not owned, directly or indirectly, any

         leaseback transaction, unless the obligation incurred and evidenced by

                 (a)      Baldwin Indebtedness.  Baldwin will not create,
incur, assume, suffer to exist, or otherwise become or remain directly or
indirectly liable with respect to any Indebtedness, other than:

                          (i)  its guaranty of the Obligations;

                          (ii)  its guaranty of the Funded Debt from time to
                 time outstanding under the Senior Note Documents in an
                 aggregate principal amount not at any time to exceed
                 $25,000,000, which guaranty and Indebtedness shall at all
                 times rank equal to and pari passus with (or junior to) the
                 Obligations;

                          (iii)  Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing
                 Date that is set forth on Schedule 8.4(a), and all of which
                 Indebtedness shall at all times be junior and subordinate to
                 the Obligations;

                          (iv)  other Funded Debt of Baldwin if, at the time of
                 incurrence thereof and after giving effect thereto, (A) no
                 Default or Event of Default exists or would otherwise
                 reasonably be anticipated to result from such transaction, (B)
                 the ratio of Consolidated Funded Debt to Consolidated Total
                 Capitalization, in each case calculated on the basis of the
                 most recently available financial information and giving pro
                 forma effect to the incurrence of such Funded Debt and the
                 application of the net proceeds therefrom, would not exceed
                 0.55 to 1.00, (C) the financial tests set forth in Section
                 8.1, calculated on the basis of the most recently available
                 financial information, would be satisfied on a pro forma
                 basis; (D) all such Indebtedness is and shall at all times be
                 junior and subordinate to the Obligations; and

                          (v)  other Indebtedness of Baldwin if, at the time of
                 incurrence thereof and after giving effect thereto, (A) no
                 Default or Event of Default exists or would otherwise
                 reasonably be anticipated to result from such transaction, (B)
                 the ratio of Consolidated  Indebtedness to Consolidated Total
                 Capitalization, in each case calculated on the basis of the
                 most recently available financial information and giving pro
                 forma effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the
                 application of the net proceeds therefrom, would not exceed
                 0.60 to 1.00, and (C) the financial tests set forth in Section
                 8.1, calculated on the basis of the most recently available
                 financial information, would be satisfied on a pro forma
                 basis; (D) no such Indebtedness shall rank senior to the
                 Obligations; and

                 (E) all such Indebtedness that constitutes Indebtedness
                 for Money Borrowed (other than Existing Capitalized Leases) is
                 and shall at all times be junior and subordinate to the
                 Obligations.

                 (b)       Subsidiary Debt.  The Borrowers will not, and  the
Borrowers and Baldwin will not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, create,
incur, assume or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable with
respect to Indebtedness other than:

                          (i)  the  Funded Debt represented by the Notes and
                 the Guaranties;

                          (ii)  the Funded Debt of the Borrowers and the
                 guarantees of the Sector Subsidiaries and any other Guarantors
                 (as defined herein) from time to time outstanding under the
                 Senior Note Documents in an aggregate principal amount not at
                 any time to exceed $25,000,000, which Indebtedness shall at
                 all times rank equal to and pari passus with (or junior to) to
                 the Obligations;

                          (iii)  Indebtedness of wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
                 Baldwin for loans permitted under Section 8.3(b)(i);

                          (iv)  any other Indebtedness of the Borrowers, any
                 Borrower Subsidiary, any Sector Subsidiary, or any Subsidiary
                 of a Sector Subsidiary; provided, however, (A) at the time of
                 the incurrence of such Indebtedness and after giving effect
                 thereto, Baldwin would be able to incur an additional $1.00 of
                 Indebtedness without breach of Section 8.4(a)(v); (B) that the
                 sum of (1) the aggregate principal amount of all such
                 Indebtedness of the Borrowers, Borrower Subsidiary and Sector
                 Subsidiaries plus (2) the aggregate principal amount of all
                 such Indebtedness of any Subsidiaries of Sector Subsidiaries
                 that constitutes Indebtedness for Money Borrowed (other than
                 Existing Capitalized Leases) shall not at any time exceed
                 $15,000,000; (C) no such Indebtedness shall rank senior to the
                 Obligations; and (D) all such Indebtedness of any Borrower,
                 Borrower Subsidiary or Sector Subsidiary that constitutes
                 Indebtedness for Money Borrowed (other than Existing
                 Capitalized Leases) is and shall at all times be junior and
                 subordinate to the Obligations.

                 (c)      Priority of Obligations.  The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Borrowers and Baldwin will not, and will not permit any
Borrower Subsidiary, any Sector Subsidiary or any Guarantor, to create, incur,
assume, suffer to exist, or





                                       74
<PAGE>   83
                                                                          

otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable with respect to any
Indebtedness that (i) is or would be senior to the Obligations, or (ii) to the
extent that it constitutes or would constitute Indebtedness for Money Borrowed
of Baldwin, any Borrower, any Borrower Subsidiary or any Sector Subsidiary
(other than Existing Capitalized Leases and other than the Indebtedness under
the Senior Note Documents), ranks or would rank equal to or pari passus with
the Obligations.

                 (d)      Indebtedness Affecting Unavailable Commitment Amount.
The foregoing notwithstanding, the Borrowers and Baldwin will not, and will not
permit any Borrower Subsidiary, Sector Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Sector
Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume, suffer to exist, or otherwise become
directly or indirectly liable with respect to any Indebtedness that would,
after giving effect to such Indebtedness in calculating the Unavailable
Commitment Amount pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof, reduce the Total Commitment
to an amount less than the then aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Loans.

         8.5. COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.  It will not and will not permit any
Borrower Subsidiary or Baldwin Subsidiary or any Related person, if it will
have a Material Adverse Effect on  Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the
Consolidated Group to:

                 (a)      engage in any transaction in connection with which
         Baldwin or any Borrower or Related Person could be subject to either a
         civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax
         imposed by section 4975 of the Code, terminate or withdraw from any
         Plan in a manner, or take any other action with respect to any such
         Plan (including, without limitation, a substantial cessation of
         business operations or an amendment of a Plan within the meaning of
         section 4041(e) or ERISA), which could result in any liability of
         Baldwin or any Borrower or any Related Person to the PBGC, to a Plan,
         to a Plan participant, to the Department of Labor or to a trustee
         appointed under section 4042(b) or (c) or ERISA), incur any liability
         to the PBGC or a Plan on account of a withdrawal from or a termination
         of a Plan under section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, incur any liability for
         post-retirement benefits under any and all welfare benefit plans (as
         defined in section 3(1) of ERISA), fail to make full payment when due
         of all amounts which, under the provisions of any Plan or applicable
         law, Baldwin, any Borrower or any Related Person is required to pay as
         contributions thereto, or permit to exist any accumulated funding
         deficiency, whether or not waive, with respect to any Plan (other than
         a Multiemployer Plan);

                 (b)      at any time permit the termination of any Single
         Employer Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)





                                       75
<PAGE>   84
                                                                          

         and Section 501(a) of the Code unless such Plan is funded so that the
         value of all benefit liabilities upon the termination date does not
         exceed the then current value of all assets in such Plan;

                 (c)      if Baldwin, any Borrower or any Related Person
         becomes obligated under a Multiemployer Plan, permit the aggregate
         complete or partial withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with
         respect to Multiemployer Plans incurred by Baldwin, any Borrower or
         any of their Subsidiaries or any Related Person to exceed any amount
         the payment of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on Baldwin,
         any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

For the purposes of subparagraph (iii) of this Section 8.5, the amount of the
withdrawal liability of Baldwin, any Borrower, or any Related Person at any
date shall be the aggregate present value of the amount claimed to have been
incurred less any portion thereof as to which Baldwin and each Borrower
reasonably believes, after appropriate consideration of possible adjustments
arising under subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, neither Baldwin, nor any
Borrower, nor any of their Subsidiaries nor any Related Person will have any
liability, provided that Baldwin and the Borrowers shall obtain promptly
written advice from independent actuarial consultants supporting such
determination.  Each Borrower and Baldwin will (x) once in each calendar year,
beginning in 1993, request and obtain a current statement of withdrawal
liability from each MultiEmployer Plan to which Baldwin, any Borrower or any
Related Person is or has been obligated to contribute and (y) transmit a copy
of such statement to the Agent and each Lender within 15 days after Baldwin or
such Borrower receives the same.

         As used in this Section8.5, the term "accumulated funding deficiency"
has the meaning specified in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code,
the terms "present value" and "current value" have the meanings specified in
section 3 of ERISA, the term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in
section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA and the term "amount of unfunded liabilities" has
the meaning specified in section 4001(18) of ERISA.

         8.6. TAX SHARING.  It will not, and will not permit any Borrower
Subsidiary or Baldwin Subsidiary to, consent to or permit the filing of or be a
party to any consolidated income tax return with any Person (other than a
consolidated return of Baldwin and its Subsidiaries).

         8.7. FISCAL YEAR.  It will not, and will not permit any Borrower
Subsidiary or Baldwin Subsidiary to, change its Fiscal





                                       76
<PAGE>   85
                                                                          

Year without the prior written consent of the Agent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld), provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
fiscal year of any Baldwin Subsidiary organized under the laws of the Kingdom
of Sweden may be changed to end on May 31 of each year and the last days of its
first three fiscal quarters to end on the last day of the immediately preceding
August, November and February.

         8.8. AMENDMENTS TO AGREEMENTS.  It will not, and will not permit any
Borrower Subsidiary or Baldwin Subsidiary to, to amend, modify or supplement
(i) any of the Senior Note Documents, (ii) any other agreement if such
amendment, modification or supplement would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Baldwin, any Significant Subsidiary or the Consolidated Group.

         8.9. OWNERSHIP OF BORROWER AND GUARANTOR STOCK.  The foregoing
notwithstanding, none of the capital stock of any Borrower or any Guarantor
shall be owned by any Person other than a Borrower or Guarantor, except
pursuant to a foreclosure on or sale of such stock pursuant to a Pledge
Agreement or other pledge agreement expressly contemplated by a Loan Document.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                       EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND ACCELERATION

         9.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  If any one or more of the following events
(herein called "Events of Default") shall occur for any reason whatsoever (and
whether such occurrence shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be
effected by operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body), that is to say:

                 (a)      if default shall be made in the due and punctual
payment of the principal of any Loan when and as the same shall be due and
payable whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise; or

                 (b)      if default shall be made in the due and punctual
payment of any amount of interest on any Loan or of any fees payable under
this Agreement or amounts requested by the Agent pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof
on the date on which the same shall be due and payable and such default shall
continue for more than five days; or

                 (c)      if default shall be made in the performance or
observance of any covenant set forth in Section 7.1(f), 7.14, 7.18, 8.1, 8.2,
8.3(d) or 8.3(e) hereof; or





                                       77
<PAGE>   86
                                                                          

                 (d)      if a default shall be made in the performance or
observance of, or shall occur under, any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranties, the Pledge Agreements, or any other
Loan Document (other than as described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above) and
such default shall continue for 30 or more days after the earlier of:  (i) any
Borrower's knowledge of such default and (ii) receipt by any Borrower of notice
of such default from the Agent; or

                 (e)      (i) if an event of default shall occur under any of
the Senior Note Documents; or (ii) if a default shall occur, which is not
waived, (A) in the payment of any principal, interest or premium with respect
to any Indebtedness (other than the Loans) of Baldwin, any Guarantor, any
Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary or (B) in the performance or observance of
any covenant contained in any agreement or instrument under or pursuant to
which any such Indebtedness may have been issued, created, assumed, guaranteed
or secured by Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary,
and such default shall continue for more than the period of grace, if any,
therein specified, and such default shall then permit the holder of any such
Indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof, provided that, in the case of
this subparagraph (ii), the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such
Indebtedness as to which such default shall occur and be continuing exceeds at
any time $1,000,000; or

                 (f)      if any representation or warranty of Baldwin, any
Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Baldwin Subsidiary contained herein or in
other Loan Document shall be false in any material respect on the date as of
which made or given; or

                 (g)      (1) if Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or any
Baldwin Subsidiary shall be unable to pay its debts generally as they become
due; (2) file a petition to take advantage of any insolvency statute; (3) make
an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (4) commence a proceeding for
the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or conservator of itself or
of the whole or substantially all of its property; (5) file a petition or
answer seeking reorganization or arrangement or similar relief under the
federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law or statute of the United
States of America or any state or similar law of any other country; or

                 (h)      (1) if a court of competent jurisdiction shall enter
an order, judgment or decree appointing a custodian, receiver, trustee, or
conservator of Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary
or of the whole or substantially all of its properties, or a liquidation of
Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary or of the
whole or substantially all of its properties, or approve a

petition filed against Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin
Subsidiary seeking reorganization or arrangement or similar relief under the
federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law or statute of the United
States of America or any state or similar law of any other country, or if,
under the provisions of any other law for the relief or aid of debtors, a court
of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of Baldwin, any
Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary or of the whole or
substantially all of its properties and such order, judgment, decree, approval
or assumption remains unstayed or undismissed for a period of thirty (30)
consecutive days; or (2) if there is commenced against Baldwin, any Guarantor,
any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary any proceeding or petition seeking
reorganization, arrangement or similar relief under the federal bankruptcy laws
or any other applicable law or statute of the United States of America or any
state which proceeding or petition remains unstayed and undismissed for a
period of sixty (60) consecutive days; or (3) if Baldwin, any Guarantor, any
Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary takes any action to indicate its consent to
or approval of any such proceeding or petition; or

                 (i)      if (1) any one or more judgments where the amount not
covered by insurance (or the amount as to which the insurer denies liability)
is in excess of $1,000,000 in aggregate amount is rendered against Baldwin, any
Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary, or (2) there is any
attachment, injunction or execution against any of Baldwin, any Guarantor, any
Borrower's or any Baldwin Subsidiary's properties for any aggregate amount in
excess of $1,000,000; and in each event there shall be any period of thirty
(30) consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment,
attachment, injunction or execution, by reason of a pending appeal or
otherwise, shall not be in effect unless such judgment, attachment, injunction
or execution shall have been vacated, satisfied or dismissed or bonded pending
appeal;

                 (j)      if (1) Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or any
Baldwin Subsidiary shall engage in any prohibited transaction (as described in
Section 6.7(a) hereof) involving any employee pension benefit plan of Baldwin,
any Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary, (2) any accumulated
funding deficiency (as referred to in Section 6.7(c) hereof), whether or not
waived, shall exist with respect to any Single Employer Plan, (3) a reportable
event (as referred to in Section 7.1(g)(i) hereof) shall occur with respect to,
or proceedings shall commence to have a trustee appointed, or a trustee shall
be appointed to administer or to terminate, any Single Employer Plan, which
reportable event or institution or proceedings is likely to result in the
termination of such Single Employer Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA, and
in the case of such a reportable event, the continuance of such reportable
event shall

<PAGE>   88
                                                                          

be unremedied for thirty (30) days after notice of such reportable event is
given, as the case may be, (4) any Single Employer Plan shall terminate for
purposes of Title IV of ERISA, or (5) Baldwin, any Guarantor, any Borrower or
any Baldwin Subsidiary shall withdraw from a Multi-employer Plan for purposes
of Title IV of ERISA, and, as a result of any such withdrawal, Baldwin, any
Guarantor, any Borrower or any Baldwin Subsidiary shall incur withdrawal
liability to such Multi-employer Plan; and in each case in clauses (1) through
(5) of this Section 10.1(k), such event or condition, together with all other
such events or conditions, if any, is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect; or

                 (k)      if any Person, or group of related Persons or group
of Persons acting in concert (other than the Persons specified by name and
title in Schedule 9.1(k)), that does not hold (as of the Closing Date) at least
50% of the outstanding voting control (as measured by the total number of votes
able to be cast by all common stock holders) (the "Voting Control") of Baldwin,
acquires more than 49% of the Voting Control of Baldwin, unless, at the option
of the Agent and the Lenders (which option may be exercised in their sole
discretion within thirty (30) days after the Agent and each Lender receives
written notice from an Authorized Officer of such change in Voting Control,
such notice to expressly identify the Agent's and Lenders' rights under this
Section 9.1(k)), (i) the Notes and all Obligations are prepaid in full and the
Revolving Credit Facility is terminated, or (ii) the Agent and the Lenders
expressly consent to such change in the Voting Control of Baldwin;

then, and in any such event and at any time thereafter, if such Event of
Default or any other Event of Default shall then be continuing, (A) the Agent,
with the consent of the Required Lenders, may, and at the direction of the
Required Lenders shall, declare any obligation of the Lenders to make further
Loans terminated, whereupon the obligation of each Lender to make further Loans
hereunder shall terminate immediately; and (B) the Agent shall at the direction
of the Required Lenders, at their option, declare by notice to any Borrower any
or all of the Obligations to be immediately due and payable, and the same,
including all interest accrued thereon and all other Obligations of any
Borrower to the Lenders, shall forthwith become immediately due and payable
without presentment, demand, protest, further notice or other formality of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything contained herein or in
any instrument evidencing the Obligations to the contrary notwithstanding;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the above, if there shall occur an
Event of Default under clause (g)(2), (3), (4) or (5) or (h)(1) or (2) above,
then the obligation of the Lenders described in clause (A) above shall
automatically terminate and any and all of the Obligations shall be immediately





                                       80
<PAGE>   89
                                                                          

due and payable without the necessity of any action by the Agent or the
Required Lenders or notice by the Agent or the Lenders.

         9.2. AGENT TO ACT.  In case any one or more Events of Default shall
occur and be continuing, the Agent may, and at the direction of the Required
Lenders shall, proceed to protect and enforce their rights or remedies either
by suit in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant, agreement or other provision contained herein or
in any other Loan Document, or to enforce the payment of the Obligations or any
other legal or equitable right or remedy.

         9.3. CUMULATIVE RIGHTS.  No right or remedy herein conferred upon the
Lenders or the Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other rights or
remedies contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and every such right
or remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other such
right or remedy contained herein and therein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute, or otherwise.

         9.4. NO WAIVER.  No course of dealing between any Borrower and any
Lender or the Agent or any failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
Agent in exercising any rights or remedies hereunder shall operate as a waiver
of any rights or remedies hereunder and no single or partial exercise of any
rights or remedies hereunder shall operate as a waiver or preclude the exercise
of any other rights or remedies hereunder or of the same right or remedy on a
future occasion.

         9.5. ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS.  If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, and the maturity of the Notes has been accelerated pursuant to
Article IX hereof, all payments received by the Agent hereunder in respect of
any principal of or interest on the Obligations or any other amounts payable by
any Borrower hereunder shall be applied by the Agent in the following order:

                 (a)      amounts due to the Agent and the Lenders, or any one
of them,  pursuant to Sections 2.12, 3.1, 3.4, 7.15 and 11.5 hereof;

                 (b)      amounts due to the Agent pursuant to Section 10.11
hereof;

                 (c)      payments of interest, to be applied in accordance
with Section 2.8 hereof;

                 (d)      payments of principal, to be applied in accordance 
with Section 2.8 hereof; and

<PAGE>   90
                                                                          

                 (e)      payments of all other amounts due under this
Agreement, if any, to be applied to the Lenders to whom such amounts are due,
pro rata in the proportion that the amount due to each Lender bears to the
amount due to all Lenders.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                   THE AGENT

         10.1. APPOINTMENT.  Each Lender (including NationsBank in its capacity
as Lender) hereby irrevocably designates and appoints NationsBank as the Agent
of the Lenders under this Agreement, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
authorizes NationsBank as the Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
to exercise such powers as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms of
this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.  The Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any of the
Lenders, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist
against the Agent.

         10.2. ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT.  The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be
entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.

         10.3. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact shall be liable to
the Lenders for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under or in connection with this Agreement except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates
shall be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by Baldwin, any Borrower, any
Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary, or any officer thereof contained in this
Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in or received by the
Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, or for any failure of Baldwin, any Borrower,
any Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary to perform its obligations thereunder.
The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any of the Lenders to ascertain
or to inquire as to





                                       82
<PAGE>   91
                                                                          

the observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents on the part of Baldwin, any
Borrower, or any Guarantor or to inspect the properties, books or records of
Baldwin, any Borrower, any Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary.

         10.4. RELIANCE.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy or telex message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Agent.  The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as
the owner thereof for all purposes unless an Assignment and Acceptance shall
have been filed with and accepted by the Agent.  The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless
it shall first receive advice or concurrence of the Lenders or the Required
Lenders as provided in this Agreement or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all present and future
holders of the Notes.

         10.5. NOTICE OF DEFAULT.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrowers
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default."  In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the
Lenders and the Borrowers.  The Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the
Required Lenders; provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received
such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

         10.6. NO REPRESENTATIONS.  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of





                                       83
<PAGE>   92

Baldwin, any Borrower, any Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary, shall be deemed
to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.  Each
Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the financial condition, creditworthiness, affairs, status and nature of
Baldwin, the Borrowers, any Guarantor and the Baldwin Subsidiaries and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender,
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and to make such investigation
as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the status and affairs, financial
or otherwise, of Baldwin, any Borrower, any Guarantor and any Baldwin
Subsidiary.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required
to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of Baldwin,
any Borrower, any Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary which may come into the
possession of the Agent or any of its affiliates.

         10.7. INDEMNIFICATION.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without
limiting any obligations of the Borrowers so to do), ratably according to the
respective principal amount of the Loans held by them (or, if no Loans are
outstanding, ratably in accordance with their respective Applicable Commitment
Percentages as then in effect) from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any
time (including without limitation at any time following the payment of the
Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other document contemplated
by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action
taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements in this Section 10.7 shall
survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.





                                       84
<PAGE>   93

         10.8. LENDER.  NationsBank and its affiliates may make loans to,
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with Baldwin,
the Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Baldwin Subsidiaries as though it were
not the Agent hereunder.  With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and
any Note issued to it, NationsBank shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include NationsBank in its individual capacity.

         10.9. RESIGNATION.  If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Agreement, then the Required Lenders may appoint a successor Agent for the
Lenders, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof, having a combined surplus and capital of
not less than $500,000,000, which is acceptable to the Borrowers and as to
which the Borrowers will not unreasonably withhold their approval, whereupon
such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
former Agent and the obligations of the former Agent shall be terminated and
canceled, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement; provided, however, if the
Required Lenders cannot agree as to a successor Agent within ninety (90) days
after such resignation, the Agent shall appoint a successor Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above, which is acceptable to the Borrowers and as to
which the Borrowers will not unreasonably withhold their approval and the
parties hereto agree to execute whatever documents are necessary to effect such
action under this Agreement or any other document executed pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, in such event, all provisions of this Agreement
and the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect.  After any
retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article
X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

         10.10.  SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, set-off, counterclaim
or otherwise, obtain payment with respect to the Obligations (other than any
payment pursuant to Section 2.14 or Article III) which results in its receiving
more than its pro rata share of the aggregate payments with respect to all of
the Obligations (other than any payment pursuant to Section 2.14 or Article
III), then (A) such Lender shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased
from the other Lenders a share in their Obligations so that the amount of the
Obligations held by each of the Lenders shall be pro rata and (B) such other
adjustments shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to insure
that the Lenders share such payments ratably; provided, however,





                                       85
<PAGE>   94

that for purposes of this Section 10.10 the term "pro rata" shall be determined
with respect to both the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender and to the
Total Commitments after subtraction in each case of amounts, if any, by which
any such Lender has not funded its share of the outstanding Loans.  If all or
any portion of any such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the Lender
which received the same, the purchase provided in this Section 10.10 shall be
rescinded to the extent of such recovery, without interest.  The Borrowers
expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that each Lender so
purchasing a portion of the other Lenders' Obligations may exercise all rights
of payment (including, without limitation, all rights of set-off, banker's lien
or counterclaim) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were
the direct holder of such portion.

         10.11.  FEES.  Each Borrower agrees, jointly and severally, to pay to
the Agent, for its individual account, in the event a financial institution
other than NationsBank becomes a Lender hereunder at any time, an Agent's fee
in such amount as shall be agreed to from time to time by the Borrowers and the
Agent, such fee to be paid in quarterly installments in arrears on each July
31, October 31, January 31 and April 30 with respect to the period commencing
with the Closing Date and continuing until and including the Revolving Credit
Termination Date.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

                 (a)      At any time after the Closing Date each Lender may,
with the prior consent of the Agent and the Borrowers (whose consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), assign to one or more banks or financial
institutions all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of the Note payable
to its order); provided, that (1) each such assignment shall be of a constant,
and not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, (2) the assigning Lender shall execute an
Assignment and Acceptance and the Borrowers hereby agree to execute replacement
Notes to give effect to the assignment if it shall have consented to such
assignment, (3) the minimum Revolving Loan Commitment which shall be assigned
is $5,000,000, (4) after giving effect to such assignment the assignor shall
retain a Revolving Loan Commitment of not less than $5,000,000, (5) such
assignee shall have an office located in the United States and (6) such
assigning Lender, such assignee, the Agent and the Borrowers shall have
executed and delivered an Assignment and Acceptance.  Upon such execution,
delivery, approval and acceptance, from and after the





                                       86
<PAGE>   95

effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder or under such Note have been assigned or negotiated to it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of
a Lender hereunder as fully as if such assignee had been named as a Lender in
this Agreement and a holder of such Note and (y) the assignor thereunder shall,
to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder or under such Note have
been assigned or negotiated by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this
Agreement.  No assignee shall have the right to further assign its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Section 11.1.  Any Lender who makes an assignment
shall pay to the Agent a one-time administrative fee of $5,000.00 which fee
shall not be reimbursed by the Borrowers.

                 (b)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm
to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (1) the
assignment made under such Assignment and Acceptance is made under such
Assignment and Acceptance without recourse to the assigning Lender; (2) such
assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of Baldwin, any
Borrower, any Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary or the performance or
observance by Baldwin, any Borrower, any Guarantor or any Baldwin Subsidiary of
any of its obligations under any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; (3) such assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof and such other Loan
Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Acceptance; (4) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (5)
such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement, the Note, any
Letter of Credit and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (6) such assignee agrees that it assumes, and will be
bound by and will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations
which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a
Lender and a holder of such Note.

                 (c)      The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
herein a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by
it.

                 (d)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Borrowers.

                 (e)      No assignee Lender shall be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Article III than the assigning Lender would have been
entitled to receive in respect of the rights hereunder transferred to the
assignee Lender.  The consent of the Borrowers to such transfer shall not
affect the preceding sentence.

                 (f)      If, pursuant to this Section 11.1, any interest in
this Agreement or any Note is transferred to any assignee Lender which is
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or
any state thereof, the assigning Lender shall cause such assignee Lender,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (1) to represent to the
assigning Lender (for the benefit of the assigning Lender, the Agent and the
Borrowers) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to
be withheld by the Agent, the Borrowers or the assigning Lender with respect to
any payments to be made to such assignee Lender in respect of the Loans, (2) to
furnish to the assigning Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers (x) either United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or United States Internal Revenue
Service Form 1001 or successor applicable form or other manner of certification
wherein such assignee Lender claims entitlement to complete exemption from
United States Federal withholding tax on all payments hereunder and (y) either
United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or United States Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 wherein such assignee Lender claims entitlement to
exemptions from United States information reporting and back up withholding and
(3) to agree (for the benefit of the assigning Lender, the Agent and the
Borrowers) to provide the assigning Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers further
or successor forms in accordance with Section 3.1(d), and to comply from time
to time with all applicable United States laws and regulations with regard to
such withholding tax exemption.

                 (g)      Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from
pledging or assigning any Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
applicable law.

                 (h)      Each Lender may sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities as to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement; provided, that (1) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (2) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other





                                       88
<PAGE>   97

parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and shall be solely
responsible for any withholding tax or other tax consequences caused by such
participation, (3) such Lender shall remain the holder of any Note issued to it
for the purpose of this Agreement, (4) such participations shall be in a
minimum amount of $1,000,000 and shall include an allocable portion of such
Lender's Participation, and (5) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and with regard to
any and all payments to be made under this Agreement; provided, that the
participation agreement between a Lender and its participants may provide that
such Lender will obtain the approval of such participant prior to such Lender's
agreeing to any amendment or waiver of any provisions of this Agreement which
would (A) extend the maturity of the Note, (B) reduce the interest rate
hereunder, (C) increase the Revolving Loan Commitment of the Lender granting
the participation or (D) release all or any substantial part of the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, and (6) the sale
of any such participations which require any Borrower to file a registration
statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or under
the securities regulations or laws of any state shall not be permitted.

         11.2. NOTICES.  Any notice shall be conclusively deemed to have been

thereof, now or hereafter pledged, mortgaged, transferred or assigned to the
Agent or a Lender or otherwise in the possession or control of the Agent or
such Lender (other than any of the foregoing held in trust) for any purpose for
the account or benefit of the Borrower and including any balance of any deposit
account or of any credit of the Borrower with the Agent or such Lender, whether
now existing or hereafter established,  shall be subject to the right of setoff
of the Agent and each Lender at any time or times during the continuance of an
Event of Default with or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, without
prior notice, to apply such  deposits or any part thereof to such of the
Obligations of the Borrower to the  Agent or such Lender then past due and in
such amounts as they may elect, and whether or not the Collateral or the
responsibility of other Persons primarily, secondarily or otherwise liable may
be deemed adequate.  For the purposes of this paragraph, all remittances and
property shall be deemed to be in the possession of the Agent or such Lender as

         11.4. SURVIVAL.  All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made herein shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans and
the execution and delivery to the Lenders of this Agreement, the Notes and the
Loan Documents and shall continue in full force and effect until all principal
and interest on the Loans are paid in full and all fees, charges and other
expenses then due and owing are paid in full and no Lender has any Revolving
Loan Commitment hereunder.  Whenever in this Agreement, any of the parties
hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors
and permitted assigns of such party and all covenants, provisions and
agreements by or on behalf of any Borrower which are contained in this
Agreement and the Notes shall inure to the benefit of the successors and
permitted assigns of the Lenders or any of them.

         11.5. EXPENSES.  Each Borrower agrees, jointly and severally, (a) to
pay or reimburse the Agent for all its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of, and
any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel to the Agent, (b) to pay or reimburse the Agent and

hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless from any and all recording and filing
fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any failure
of any Borrower to pay or delay by any Borrower in paying, documentary, stamp,
excise and other similar taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to
be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation of
any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or
in respect of, this Agreement, (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold the Agent and
the Lenders harmless from and against any and all other out-of-pocket
liabilities, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
arising in connection with any claim or litigation by any Person (other than a
party hereto) resulting from the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance
and administration of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
in any respect relating to any transaction financed or to be financed in whole
or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Loan (all the
foregoing, collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"); provided, however,
that the Borrowers shall have no obligation hereunder with respect to
indemnified liabilities arising from the willful misconduct or gross negligence
of any Lender or the Agent.  The agreements in this Section 11.5 shall survive
repayment of the Notes and all other Obligations hereunder.

         11.6. AMENDMENTS.  No amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and no consent by the
Lenders to any departure therefrom by any Borrower shall be effective unless
such amendment, modification or waiver shall be in writing and signed by the
Agent, but only upon having received the written consent of the Required
Lenders, and (with respect to amendments, modifications and waivers) by the
Borrowers, and the same shall then be effective only for the period and on the
conditions and for the specific instances and purposes specified in such
writing; provided, however, that, no such amendment, modification or waiver

                 (a)      which changes, extends or waives any provision of
Section 10.10 or this Section 11.6, the amount of or the due date of any
scheduled installment of or the rate of interest payable on any Obligation,
changes the definition of Required Lenders, which increases or extends the
Revolving Loan Commitment of any Lender or which waives any Event of Default
under Section 9.1(h) or (i) shall be effective unless in writing and signed by
each of the Lenders affected thereby; or

                 (b)      which affects the rights, privileges, immunities or
indemnities of the Agent, shall be effective unless in writing and signed by
the Agent.

No notice to or demand on any Borrower in any case shall entitle any Borrower
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

         11.7. COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to
produce or account for more than one such fully-executed counterpart.  All
signatures need not be on one counterpart.

         11.8. TERMINATION.  The termination of this Agreement shall not affect
any rights of any Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent or any obligation of any
Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent, arising prior to the effective date of such
termination, and the Obligations arising prior to termination have been
irrevocably Fully Satisfied.  The rights granted to the Agent for the benefit
of the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall continue in
full force and effect, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, until
all of the Obligations have been Fully Satisfied after the termination hereof
or the Borrowers have furnished the Lenders and the Agent with an
indemnification satisfactory to the Agent and each Lender with respect thereto.
All representations, warranties, covenants, waivers and agreements contained
herein shall survive termination hereof until the Obligations have been Fully
Satisfied unless otherwise provided herein.  "Fully Satisfied" means, with
respect to the Obligations as of any date, that, on or before such date, (a)
all amounts then due and payable with respect to the Loan Documents on or
before such date shall have been paid in full in cash, (b) all principal,
interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due and payable by any Borrower
to the Agent and the Lenders shall have been paid in full in cash, and (c) the
Revolving Loan Commitments of each Lender shall have expired or been
terminated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after receipt of any payment of
all or any part of the Obligations, any Lender is for any reason compelled to
surrender such payment to any Person because such payment is determined to be
void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, a diversion of trust
funds or for any other reason, this Agreement shall continue in full force and
each Borrower, jointly and severally, shall be liable to, and shall indemnify
and hold such Lender harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered until
such Lender shall have been finally and irrevocably paid in full.  The
provisions of the foregoing sentence shall be and remain effective
notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Lenders in
reliance upon such payment, and any such contrary action so taken shall be
without prejudice to the Lenders' rights under this Agreement and shall be
deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment having become final and
irrevocable.
