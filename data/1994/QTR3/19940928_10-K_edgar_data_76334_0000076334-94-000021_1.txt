                       Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1994


                                   PART I

            ITEM 1.     Business.  Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a leading
worldwide full-line manufacturer of motion control products, including fluid
power systems, electromechanical controls and related components.  Fluid power
involves the transfer and control of power through the medium of liquid, gas
or air, in both hydraulic and pneumatic applications.  Fluid power systems
move and position materials, control machines, vehicles and equipment and
improve industrial efficiency and productivity.  Components of a simple fluid
power system include a pump which generates pressure, valves which control the
fluid's flow, a cylinder which translates the pressure in the fluid into
mechanical energy, a filter to remove contaminants and numerous hoses,
couplings, fittings and seals.  Electromechanical control involves the use of
electronic components and systems to control motion and precisely locate or
vary speed in automation applications.

            The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1938.  Its principal
executive offices are located at 17325 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44112,
telephone (216) 531-3000.  As used in this Report, unless the context
otherwise requires, the term "Company" or "Parker" refers to Parker-Hannifin
Corporation and its subsidiaries.

            The Company's manufacturing, service, distribution and
administrative facilities are located in 33 states, Puerto Rico and worldwide
in 30 foreign countries.  Its motion control technology is used in the
products of its two business Segments:  Industrial and Aerospace.  The
products are sold as original and replacement equipment through product and
distribution centers worldwide.  The Company markets its products through its
direct-sales employees and more than 5,000 independent distributors.  Parker
products are supplied to over a quarter million customer outlets in virtually
every major manufacturing, transportation and processing industry.  For the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, net sales were $2,576,337,000; Industrial
Segment products accounted for 79% of net sales and Aerospace Segment products
for 21%.

            During the fiscal year the Company made three acquisitions.  In 
November, 1993, the Company acquired the Electro-pneumatic Division of 
Telemecanique in Evreux, France, a leading European manufacturer of pneumatic 
products.  In December, 1993, the Company increased its ownership from 40% to 
100% in LDI Pneutronics Corp., located in Hollis, New Hampshire, which 
specializes in advanced-technology pneumatic valves and components.  In 
April, 1994, the Company purchased the assets of Finn-Filter Oy, a leading 
Scandinavian filter manufacturer with manufacturing locations in Urjala and 
Hyrynsalmi, Finland and a sales subsidiary in Sweden.

Markets

            Motion control systems are used throughout industry in
applications which require substantial amounts of energy.  Such applications
include moving of materials, controlling machines, vehicles and equipment and
positioning materials during the manufacturing process.  Motion control
systems contribute to the efficient use of energy and improve industrial
productivity.

            The more than a quarter million customer outlets which carry the
Company's parts are found throughout virtually every significant
manufacturing, transportation and processing industry.  No customer accounted
for more than 3% of the Company's total net sales for the fiscal year.

            The major markets for products of the Fluid Connector, Motion &
Control, Filtration and Seal Groups of the Industrial Segment are agricultural
machinery, construction equipment, food production, industrial machinery,
instrumentation, lumber and paper, machine tools, marine, mining, mobile
equipment, chemicals, petrochemicals, robotics, textiles, transportation and
every other major production and processing industry.  Products manufactured
by the Industrial Segment's Automotive and Refrigeration Group are utilized
principally in automotive and mobile air conditioning systems, industrial
refrigeration systems and home and commercial air conditioning equipment. 
Sales of Industrial Segment products are made to original equipment
manufacturers and their replacement markets.

            Aerospace Segment sales are made primarily to the commercial,
military and general aviation markets and are made to original equipment
manufacturers and to end users for maintenance, repair and overhaul.


Principal Products, Methods of Distribution and Competitive Conditions

            Industrial Segment.  The product lines of the Company's Industrial
Segment cover most of the components of motion control systems.  The Motion
& Control Group manufactures components and systems used to provide motion,
control and conditioning through the medium of pressurized fluids and
electricity.  Products include hydraulic and precision metering pumps, power
units, control valves, accumulators, cylinders, servo actuators, rotary
actuators and motors, pneumatic control valves, pressure regulators,
lubricators, hydrostatic steering components, electronic controls and systems
and automation devices.  The Filtration Group manufactures filters to remove
contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other fluids in industrial,
process, mobile and environmental applications.  The Fluid Connectors Group
manufactures connectors, including tube fittings and hose fittings, hoses and
couplers which transmit and contain fluid.  The Seal Group manufactures
sealing devices, including o-rings and o-seals, gaskets and packings which

            Industrial Segment products include both standard items which are
produced in large quantities and custom units which are engineered and
produced to original equipment manufacturers' specifications for application
to a particular end product.  Both standard and custom products are also used
in the replacement of original motion control system components.  Industrial
Segment products are marketed primarily through field sales employees and more
than 5,000 independent distributors.

            Aerospace Segment.  The principal products of the Company's
Aerospace Segment are hydraulic, pneumatic, and fuel systems and components
which are utilized on virtually every domestic commercial, military and
general aviation aircraft.

            The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses
related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under
patents owned by others.  In addition, patent applications on certain products
are now pending, although there can be no assurance that patents will be
issued.  The Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single
patent or group of patents.

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business

            The Company's backlog at June 30, 1994 was approximately
$852,482,000 and at June 30, 1993 was approximately $856,517,000. 
Approximately 75% of the Company's backlog at June 30, 1994 is scheduled for
delivery in the succeeding twelve months.  The Company's business generally
is not seasonal in nature.

Environmental Regulation

            The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge
of materials into the environment.  Among other environmental laws, the
Company is subject to the federal "Superfund" law, under which the Company has
been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for
clean up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund priority list.  The Company
believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to
prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial
liability to the Company.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations
requires continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company. 
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past,
and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material effects on
the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.

       The Company believes that its properties have been adequately
maintained, are in good condition generally and are suitable and adequate for
its business as presently conducted.  The extent of utilization of the
Company's properties varies among its plants and from time to time.  The
Company's restructuring efforts over the past several years have brought
capacity levels closer to present and anticipated needs.  Although capacity
has been reduced and production volume has increased over the last fiscal
year, most of the Company's material manufacturing facilities remain capable
of handling additional volume increases.

            AGREEMENT between PARKER-HANNIFIN 
CORPORATION, an Ohio Corporation (the "Company"), and _____________________ 
(the "Executive"), dated the ______ day of ___________, 1981.

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
            WHEREAS,
            A.    The Executive is a principal officer of the Company and an 
integral part of its management.
            B.    The Company wishes to assure both itself and the Executive 
of continuity of management in the event of any actual or threatened change 
in control of the Company.
            C.    This agreement is not intended to alter materially the 
compensation and benefits that the Executive could reasonably expect in the 
absence of a change in control of the Company and, accordingly, this 
Agreement, though taking effect upon execution thereof, will be operative 
only upon a change in control of the Company, as that term is hereafter 
defined.

            NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties as
follows:

     1.  OPERATION OF AGREEMENT
            This Agreement shall be effective immediately upon its execution 
by the parties hereto, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, neither the Agreement nor any provision thereof shall be 
operative unless and until there has been a 

<PAGE>

Change in Control of the Company, as defined in Section 17 below while the 
Executive is in the employ of the Company.  Upon such a Change in Control 
of the Company, this Agreement and all provisions thereof shall become 
operative immediately.

     2.  EMPLOYMENT; PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT

     2.01  The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ,
and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, for the
period set forth in paragraph 2.02 below (the Period of Employment), in the
position and with the duties and responsibilities set forth in Section 3
below, and upon the other terms and conditions hereinafter stated.

     2.02  The Period of Employment shall be deemed to have commenced on the 
date of this Agreement and, subject only to the provisions of Section 6 
below, relating to death or Disability, shall continue until the close of 
business on the date stated in Exhibit A attached to and made part of this 
Agreement.  In the event that the Executive shall continue in the full-time 
employment of the Company after the latter date, such continued employment 
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Period
of Employment shall include the period during which the Executive in fact so 
continues in such employment.

     3.  POSITION, DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES

     3.01  (a)   It is contemplated that during the Period of Employment the 
Executive shall continue to serve as a principal officer of the Company with 
the office(s) and title(s), 

                                     - 2 -

set forth in Exhibit B attached to and made part 
of this Agreement, reporting as set in such Exhibit B and with duties and 
responsibilities including those specifically set forth in such Exhibit B.

           (b)   At all times during the Period of Employment, the Executive 
shall hold a position of responsibility and importance and a position of 
scope, with the functions, duties and responsibilities attached thereto, at 
least equal in responsibility and importance and in scope to and 
commensurate with his position on the date of this Agreement described in 
general terms in subparagraph 3.01(a) above.

     3.02  During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall also 
serve and continue to serve, if and when elected and reelected, as an 
officer or director, or both, of any subsidiary, division or affiliate of 
the Company.

     3.03  Throughout the Period of Employment the Executive shall devote 
his full time and undivided attention during normal business hours to the 
business and affairs of the Company, except for reasonable vacations and 
except for illness or incapacity, but nothing in this Agreement shall 
preclude the Executive from devoting reasonable periods required for serving 
as a director or member of a committee of any organization involving no conflict
of interest with the interests of the Company, from engaging in charitable 
and community activities, and from managing his personal investments, 
provided that such activities do not materially interfere with the regular 
performance of his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement.

be required to be absent therefrom on travel status or otherwise more than 
the total number of working days in any calendar year stated in such Exhibit C.

     4.  COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION PLANS, PERQUISITES

     4.01  (a)  For all services rendered by the Executive in any capacity 
during the Period of Employment, including, without limitation, services as 
an executive, officer, director or member of any committee of the Company 
or of any subsidiary, division or affiliate thereof, the Executive shall be 
paid as compensation:

           (i)  A base salary, payable not less often than monthly, at a rate 
of no less than $_____________ per month, with such increases in such rate as 
shall be awarded from time to time in accordance with the Company's regular 
administrative practices of salary increases applicable to executives of the 
Company in effect and on the date of this Agreement, and

          (ii)  An executive performance award or bonus under the Company's
Executive Compensation Plan, or such equivalent successor plan as may be 
adopted by the Company, upon a basis that will render total compensation 
for any calendar month, consisting of the minimum base salary provided in 
clause (i) of this subparagraph 4.01(a) plus bonus for such month determined 
by dividing the award made for the fiscal year of the Company in which such 
month occurred by the number of months in such fiscal year, equal to no less 
than the amount set forth from 

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

time to time in Exhibit D to this Agreement, 
which amount shall be equal to $_____________ plus such salary increases as 
may have been granted pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph 4.01(a).

           (b)   Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph 
4.01(a) above, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a change in the mix 
between the base salary and bonus of the Executive by increasing the base 
salary of the Executive.

           (c)   Any increase in salary pursuant to clause (i) of 
subparagraph 4.01(a) or in bonus or other compensation shall in no way 
diminish any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

     4.02  During the Period of Employment the Executive shall be and 
continue to be a full participant in the Company's Deferred Compensation 
Plan, its 1977 Employees Stock Option Plan and 1977 Stock Appreciation Rights 
Plan, or equivalent successor plans that may be adopted by the Company, 
with at least the same reward opportunities as that have been heretofore 
provided.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude improvement of reward 
opportunities in such plans or other plans in accordance with the present 
practice of the Company.

     4.03  During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be entitled to
perquisites, including, without limitation, an office, secretarial and clerical 
staff, and to fringe benefits, including, without limitation, the business and 
personal use of an automobile and payment or reimbursement of club dues, in 
each case at least equal to those attached to his office on the date of this 
Agreement, as well as to reimbursement, upon proper accounting, 

                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>

of reasonable expenses and disbursements incurred by him in the course of his 
duties.

     5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     5.01  The compensation provided for in Section 4 above, together with 
other matters therein set forth, is in addition to the benefits provided for 
in this Section 5.

     5.02  In the event that the Executive shall not heretofore have been 
designated a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits 
Program of the Company, the Executive shall be and hereby is designated a 
Participant in that Program on and as of the date this Agreement becomes 
operative in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Agreement.

     5.03  The Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall be entitled 
to all payments and benefits and service credit for benefits during the 
Period of Employment to which officers of the Company, their dependents and 
beneficiaries are entitled as the result of the employment of such officers 
during the Period of Employment under the terms of employee plans and 
practices of the Company, including, without limitation, the Company's 
retirement program (consisting of its Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, 
its Excess Benefits Plan, if any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program) the Company's stock purchase and savings, thrift and 
investment plans, if any, the Company's Group Life Insurance Plan, its 
accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability, medical, dental and 
health and welfare plans) and other present or equivalent successor plans and 
practices of the Company, its subsidiaries and divisions, for which officers,

                                      - 6 -
<PAGE>

dependents and beneficiaries are eligible, and to all payments or other 
benefits under any such plan or practice after the Period of Employment as a 
result of participation in such plan or practice during the Period of 
Employment.

     5.04  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from amending 
or terminating any employee benefit plan or practice, but, it being the 
intent of the parties that the Executive shall continue to be entitled during 
the Period of Employment to perquisites as set forth in paragraph 4.03 above, 
and to benefits and service credit for benefits under paragraph 5.03 above at 
least equal to those attached to his position on the date of this Agreement, 
nothing in this Agreement shall operate as, or be construed or reduce or 
authorize, a reduction without the Executive's written consent in the level 
of such perquisites, benefits or service credit for benefits; in the event of 
any such reduction, by amendment or termination of any plan or practice or 
otherwise, the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall continue to be 
entitled to perquisites, benefits and service credit for benefits at least 
equal to the perquisites and to benefits and service credit for benefits 
under such plans or practices that he or his dependents and beneficiaries 
would have received if such reduction had not taken place.

     6.  EFFECT OF DEATH OR DISABILITY

     6.01  In the event of the death of the Executive during the Period of 
Employment, the legal representative of the Executive shall be entitled to 
the compensation provided for in paragraph 4.01 above for the month in 
which death shall have taken place at the rate being paid at the time of 
death, and the Period of Employment shall be deemed to have 

                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>

ended as of the close of business on the last day of the month in which 
death shall have occurred, but without prejudice to any payments due in 
respect of the Executive's death.

     6.02  (a)  The term "Disability", as used in this Agreement, shall 
mean an illness or accident which prevents the Executive from performing 
his duties under this Agreement for a period of six consecutive months.  
The Period of Employment shall be deemed to have ended as of the close of 
business on the last day of such six months period but without prejudice 
to any payments due the Executive in respect of disability.

           (b)  In the event of the Disability of the Executive during 
the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be paid an amount equal to 
the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the month in which such 
Disability commenced.  Such amount shall be paid at the end of each month 
during the period of such Disability but not in excess of six months.

           (c)  The amount of any payments due under this paragraph 6.02 
shall be reduced by any payments to which the Executive may be entitled 
for the same period because of disability under any disability or pension 
plan of the Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

Agreement relating to mitigation of damages and to 
compliance by the Executive with the provisions of paragraph 7.04 below, 
relating to Competition, and of Section 9 below, relating to confidential 
information, the Company shall, as liquidated damages or severance pay, or
both, pay to the Executive and provide him, his dependents, beneficiaries and 
estate, with the following:

      (a)  The Company shall pay the Executive (i) the compensation provided in
paragraph 4.01 above for the month in which Termination shall have occurred at 
the rate being paid at the time of Termination and (ii) during the remainder 
of the Period of Employment an amount equal to the total compensation provided 
in clause (ii) of subparagraph 4.01(a).  Such amount shall be paid in monthly 
installments at the end of each month commencing with the month next following 
the month in which Termination occurred and continuing during the remainder 
of the Period of Employment or through the month in which the death of the 
Executive shall have occurred if earlier.

      (b)  During the period that the payments provided for in subparagraph 
(a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made, the Executive, his 
dependents, beneficiaries and estate, shall continue to be entitled to all 
benefits and service credit for benefits under employee benefit plans of 
the Company as if still employed during such period under this Agreement 
and, if and to the extent that such benefits or service credit for benefits 
shall not be payable or provided under any such plans to the Executive, his 
dependents, beneficiaries and estate, by reason of his no longer being an 
employee of the Company as the result of Termination, the Company shall 
itself pay or provide for payment of such benefits and service credit 
for benefits to the Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate.

      (c)  The remainder of the period of Employment shall be considered 
service with 

                                     - 9 -

the Company for the purpose (i) of continued credits under 
the Company's retirement program, (consisting of its Retirement Plan for 
Salaried Employees, its Excess Benefits Plan, if any, and its Supplemental 
Executive Retirement Benefits Program) as each such plan or program was in 
effect immediately prior to Termination and (ii) of all other benefit plans
of the Company as in effect immediately prior to Termination.

      (d)   In the event that the Executive shall at the time of Termination 
hold an outstanding and unexercised (whether or not exercisable at the time) 
option or options theretofore granted by the Company, the Company shall, in 
addition to the amounts provided for in subparagraphs 7.02(a) and 7.02(b), 
pay to the Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to the excess above the 
option price under each such option of the Fair Market Value at the time of 
Termination of the shares subject to each such option.  Solely for the 
purpose of this subparagraph (d), Fair Market Value at the time of Termination
shall be deemed to mean the higher of (i) the average of the reported closing 
prices of the Common Shares of the Company, as reported on the New York Stock 
Exchange-Composite Transactions, on the last trading day prior to the 
Termination and on the last trading day of each of the two preceding thirty-
day periods, and (ii) in the event that a Change in Control, as defined in 
Section 17 below, prior to Termination shall have taken place as the result 
of a tender offer and such Change in Control was consummated within twelve 
months of Termination, the highest consideration paid for Common Shares of 
the Company in the course of such tender or exchange offer.  Upon receiving 
the payment from the Company called for by clause (i) of subparagraph (a) of 
this paragraph 7.02, the Executive shall execute and deliver to the Company 
a general release in favor of the Company, its successors and assigns, in 
respect of any and all matters, including, without limitation, any 

                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>

and all rights under any outstanding and unexercisable options at the time of 
Termination, except for the payments and obligations required to be made or 
assumed by the Company under this Agreement which at the time had not yet 
been made or assumed by the Company and except for such other valid 
obligations of the Company as shall be set forth in such release.

     7.03  The word "Termination", for the purpose of this Section 7 and 
any other provision of this Agreement, shall mean:

      (a)  Termination by the Company of the employment of the Executive by 
the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason other than for Cause as 
defined in paragraph 7.05 below or for Disability as defined in 
subparagraph 6.02(a) above; or

      (b)  Termination by the Executive of his employment by the Company 
and its subsidiaries upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

         (i)  Failure to elect or reelect the Executive to, or removal of 
the Executive from, any of the offices described in paragraph 3.01 above.

        (ii)  A significant change in the nature or scope of the 
authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to the position summarized 
in paragraph 3.01 above, or a reduction in compensation, which is not 
remedied within 30 days after receipt by the Company of written notice 
from the Executive.

       (iii)  A determination by the Executive made in good faith that as a 
result of a Change in Control of the Company, as defined in Section 17 below, 
and a change in circumstances thereafter and since the date of this Agreement 
significantly affecting his position, he is unable to carry out the 
authorities, powers, functions or 

                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

duties attached to his position and contemplated by Section 3 of this 
Agreement and the situation is not remedied within 30 days after receipt by 
the Company of written notice from the Executive of such determination.

        (iv)  A breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement not
embraced within the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this 
subparagraph 7.03(b) which is not remedied within 30 days after receipt by 
the Company of written notice from the Executive.

         (v)   The liquidation, dissolution, consolidation or merger of the 
Company or transfer of all or a significant portion of its assets unless a 
successor or successors (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) to which 
all or a significant portion of its assets have been transferred shall have 
assumed all duties and obligations of the Company under this Agreement, 
provided that in any event set forth in this subparagraph 7.03(b) above, the 
Executive shall have elected to terminate his employment under this Agreement 
upon not less than forty and not more than ninety days' advance written 
notice to the Board of Directors of the Company, Attention of the Secretary, 
given, except in the case of a continuing breach, within three calendar 
months after (A) failure to be so elected or reelected, or removal, (B) 
expiration of the thirty-day cure period with respect to such event, or (C) 
the closing date of such liquidation, dissolution, consolidation, merger or 
transfer of assets, as the case may be.

     An election by the Executive to terminate his employment given 
under the provisions of this paragraph 7.03 shall not be deemed a voluntary 
termination of employment by the Executive for the purpose of this Agreement 
or any plan or practice of

                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

the Company.

     7.04  (a)  There shall be no obligation on the part of the Company to 
make any further payments provided for in paragraph 7.02 above or to provide 
any further benefits specified in such paragraph 7.02 if the Executive shall, 
during the period that such payments are being made or benefits provided, 
engage in Competition with the Company as hereinafter defined, provided all 
of the following shall have taken place:

           (i)   the Secretary of the Company, pursuant to resolution of the 
Board of Directors of the Company, shall have given written notice to the 
Executive that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, the Executive is 
engaged in such Competition, specifying the details;

          (ii)  the Executive shall have been give a reasonable opportunity 
to appear before the Board of Directors prior to the determination of the
Board evidenced by such resolution; and

         (iii) the Executive shall neither have ceased to engage in such 
Competition within thirty days from his receipt of such notice nor 
diligently taken all reasonable steps to that end during such thirty-day 
period and thereafter.

      (b)   The word "Competition" for purposes of this paragraph 7.04 and 
any other provision of this Agreement shall mean taking a management 
position with or control of a business engaged in the manufacture, 
processing, purchase of distribution of products which constituted 15% or 
more of the sales of the Company and its subsidiaries and divisions during 
the last fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of the 
Executive's employment (or during any fiscal year of the Company during the 
Period of Employment); 

                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

provided, however, that in no event shall ownership of 
less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the 
election of directors of a corporation with a class of equity securities held 
of record by more than 500 persons, standing alone, be deemed Competition 
with the Company within the meaning of this paragraph 7.04.

     7.05  For the purpose of any provision of this Agreement, the 
termination of the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been for 
Cause only

     (a)  if termination of his employment shall have been the result of an 
act or acts of dishonesty on the part of the Executive constituting a felony 
and resulting or intended to result directly or indirectly in gain or 
personal enrichment at the expense of the Company, or

     (b)  if there has been a breach by the Executive during the Period of 
Employment of the provisions of paragraph 3.03 above, relating to the time 
to be devoted to the affairs of the Company, or of Section 9, relating to 
confidential information, and such breach results in demonstrably material 
injury to the Company, and with respect to any alleged breach of paragraph 
3.03 hereof, the Executive shall have both failed to remedy such alleged 
breach within thirty days from his receipt of written notice by the Secretary 
of the Company pursuant to resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors 
of the Company after notice to the Executive and an opportunity to be heard 
demanding that he remedy such alleged breach, and failed to take all 
reasonable steps to that end during such thirty-day period and thereafter; 
provided that there shall have been delivered to the Executive a certified 
copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted by the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of the entire membership of 
the Board of Directors called and 


                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>


held for that purpose and at which the Executive was given an opportunity to 
be heard, finding that the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in 
subparagraphs (a) or (b) above, specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

     Anything in this paragraph 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the 
contrary notwithstanding, the employment of the Executive shall in no event 
be considered to have been terminated by the Company for Cause if termination 
of his employment took place (i) as the result of bad judgment or negligence 
on the part of the Executive, or (ii) as the result of an act or omission 
without intent of gaining therefrom directly or indirectly a profit to which 
the Executive was not legally entitled, or (iii) because of an act or 
omission believed by the Executive in good faith to have been in or not 
opposed to the interests of the Company, or (iv) for any act or omission in 
respect of which a determination could properly be made that the Executive 
met the applicable standard of conduct prescribed for indemnification or 
reimbursement or payment of expenses under the Code of Regulations of the 
Company or the laws of the State of Ohio or the directors' and officers' 
liability insurance of the Company, in each case as in effect at the time 
of such act or omission, or (v) as the result of an act or omission which 
occurred more than twelve calendar months prior to the Executive's having 
been given notice of the termination of his employment for such act or 
omission unless the commission of such act or such omission could not at the
time of such commission or omission have been known to a member of the 
Board of Directors of the Company (other than the Executive, if he is then a 
member of the Board of Directors), in which case more than twelve calendar 
months from the date that the commission of such act or such omission was or 
could reasonably have been so known, or (vi) as the result of a continuing 
course of action which commenced and was or could 


                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

reasonably have been known to a member of the Board of Directors of the 
Company (other than the Executive) more than twelve calendar months prior 
to notice having been given to the Executive of the termination of his 
employment.

     7.06  In the event that the Executive's employment shall be terminated 
by the Company during the Period of Employment and such termination is 
alleged to be for Cause, or the Executive's right to terminate his employment 
under paragraph 7.03(b) above shall be questioned by the Company, or the 
Company shall withhold payments or provision of benefits because the 
Executive is alleged to be engaged in Competition in breach of the provisions 
of paragraph 7.04 above or for any other reason, the Executive shall have the 
right, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law, at his 
election either to seek arbitration within the area described in Exhibit C 
attached hereto and made part of this Agreement under the rules of the 
American Arbitration Association by serving a notice to arbitrate upon the 
Company or to institute a judicial proceeding, in either case within ninety
days after having received notice of termination of his employment or 
notice in any form that the termination of his employment under paragraph 
7.03(b) is subject to question or that the Company is withholding or proposed 
to withhold payments or provision of benefits or within such longer period as 
may reasonably be necessary for the Executive to take action in the event 
that his illness or incapacity should preclude his taking such action within 
such ninety-day period.

     8.  OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DAMAGES

     8.01  In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 above, 
the 


                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

Executive shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages by seeking 
other employment; provided, however, that he shall not be required to accept 
a position of less dignity and importance or of substantially different 
character than the highest position theretofore held by him with the Company 
or a position that would call upon him to engage in competition within the 
meaning of paragraph 7.04(b) above, nor shall he be required to accept a 
position other than in a location reasonably convenient to his principal 
residence immediately prior to such Termination.

     8.02  To the extent that the Executive shall receive compensation, 
benefits and service credit for benefits from other employment secured 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8.01 above, the payments to be 
made and the benefits and service credit for benefits to be provided by 
the Company under the provisions of paragraph 7.02 above shall be 
correspondingly reduced.  Such reduction shall, in the event of any 
question, be determined jointly by the firm of certified public 
accountants selected by the Executive, in each case upon the advice of 
actuaries to the extent the certified public accountants consider 
necessary, and, in the event such accountants are unable to agree on a 
resolution of the question, such reduction shall be determined by an 
independent firm of certified public accountants selected jointly by 
both firms of accountants.

     9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

     9.01  The Executive agrees not to disclose, either while in the 
Company's employ or at any time thereafter, to any person not employed by 
the Company, or not engaged to render services to the Company, any 
confidential information obtained by him while in the 


                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>

employ of the Company, including, without limitation, any of the Company's 
inventions, processes, methods of distribution or customers or trade secrets; 
provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude the Executive from 
use or disclosure of information known generally to the public or of 
information not considered confidential by persons engaged in the business 
conducted by the Company or from disclosure required by law or Court order.

     9.02  The Executive also agrees that upon leaving the Company's employ, 
he will not take with him, without the prior written consent of an officer 
authorized to act in the matter by the Board of Directors of the Company, any 
drawing, blueprint, specification or other document of the Company, its 
subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, which is of a confidential nature 
relating to the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, or 
without limitation, relating to its or their methods of distribution, or any 
description of any formulae or secret processes.

     10.  SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE

     In the event that, following the specific date set forth in paragraph 
2.02 of this Agreement, the employment of the Executive shall be terminated 
by the Company prior to his normal retirement date and such termination shall 
be for any reason other than for Cause, as defined in paragraph 7.05 above, 
the Company shall pay the Executive as a severance allowance a lump sum equal 
to 50% of his annual compensation for one year, consisting of base salary at 
the rate paid for the month prior to such termination of employment plus his 
most recent executive performance award of bonus under the Company's annual 
incentive plan.


                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>

     11.  WITHHOLDING

        Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be 
made by the Company hereunder to the Executive or his estate or beneficiaries 
shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax 
and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably determine it 
should withhold pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.  In lieu of 
withholding such amounts, the Company may accept other provisions to the end 
that it has sufficient funds to pay all taxes required by law to be withheld 
in respect of any or all of such payments.

     12.  NOTICES

        All notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for 
by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given if and 
when mailed in the continental United States by registered or certified mail 
or personally delivered to the party entitled thereto at the address stated 
from time to time in Exhibit E to this Agreement which address shall be such 
address as the addressee may have given most recently by a similar notice.  
Any such notice, request, demand or other communication delivered in person 
shall be deemed to have been received on the date of delivery.

     13.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

     13.01  There shall be no right of set-off or counter-claim, in respect 
of any claim, debt or obligation, against any payments to the Executive, his 
dependents, beneficiaries or estate provided for in this Agreement.

     13.02  The Company and the Executive recognize that each party will 
have no 

                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

adequate remedy at law for breach by the other of any of the 
agreements contained herein and, in the event of any such breach, the Company 
and the Executive hereby agree and consent that the other shall be entitled 
to a decree of specific performance, mandamus or other appropriate remedy to 
enforce performance of such agreements.

     13.03  No right or interest to or in any payments shall be assignable by 
the Executive; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude him 
from designating one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be 
payable after his death and shall not preclude the legal representative of 
his estate from assigning any right hereunder to the person or persons 
entitled thereto under his will or, in the case of intestacy, to the person
or persons entitled thereto under the laws of intestacy applicable to his 
estate.  The term "beneficiaries" as used in this Agreement shall mean a 
beneficiary or beneficiaries so designated to receive any such amount or, 
if no beneficiary has been so designated, the legal representative of the 
Executive's estate.

     13.04  No right, benefit or interest hereunder, shall be subject to 
anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, 
hypothecation, or set-off in respect of any claim, debt or obligation, or 
to execution, attachment, levy or similar process, or assignment by 
operation of law.  Any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to effect any
action specified in the immediately preceding sentence shall, to the full 
extent permitted by law, be null, void and of no effect.

     13.05  In the event of the Executive's death or a judicial determination 
of his 


                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

incompetence, reference in this Agreement to the Executive shall be 
deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his legal representative or, where 
appropriate, to his beneficiary or beneficiaries.

     13.06  The titles to sections in this Agreement are intended solely for 
convenience and no provision of this Agreement is to be construed by reference 
to the title of any section.

     13.07  This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the 
benefit of the Executive, his heirs and legal representatives, and the 
Company and its successors as provided in Section 16 hereof.

     14.  AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION; WAIVER

     No provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived unless
such amendment, modification or waiver shall be authorized by the Board of 
Directors of the Company or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors 
and shall be agreed to in writing, signed by the Executive and by an officer 
of the Company thereunto duly authorized.  Except as otherwise specifically 
provided in this Agreement, no waiver by either party hereto of any breach 
by the other party hereto of any condition or provision of this Agreement to 
be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent
breach of such condition or provision or a waiver of a similar or dissimilar 
provision or condition at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.


                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>

     15.  SEVERABILITY

     In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, 
shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole 
or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement and parts of such 
provision not so invalid or unenforceable shall be unaffected thereby and 
shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     16.  SUCCESSORS TO THE COMPANY

     Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of the Company, 
including, without limitation, any corporation or corporations acquiring 
directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the assets of the Company 
whether by merger, consolidation, sale or otherwise (and such successor shall 
thereafter be deemed "the Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but 
shall not otherwise be assignable by the Company.

     17.  CHANGE IN CONTROL

     For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control of the
Company" shall mean a change in control of a nature that would be required to 
be reported in response to Item 5(f) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A 
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as in effect on the 
date of this Agreement; provided that, without limitation, such a change in 
control shall be deemed to have occurred if and when (a) any "person" (as 
such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934) is or becomes a beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 
securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting 
power of the Company's 

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>

then outstanding securities or (b) during any period 
of 24 consecutive months, commencing before or after the date of this 
Agreement, individuals who at the beginning of such twenty-four month 
period were directors of the Company for whom the Executive shall have voted
cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of 
Directors of the Company.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement
as the day and year first above written.

           AGREEMENT between PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION, an Ohio
Corporation (the "Company"), and _____________________ (the "Executive"), 
dated the______ day of ___________, 1984.

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
            WHEREAS,
            A.    The Executive is a principal officer of the Company and an 
integral part of its management.

            B.    The Company wishes to assure both itself and the Executive 
of continuity of management in the event of any actual or threatened change in 
control of the Company.

            C.    This agreement is not intended to alter materially the 
compensation and benefits that the Executive could reasonably expect in the 
absence of a change in control of the Company and, accordingly, this 
Agreement, though taking effect upon execution thereof, will be operative only 
upon a change in control of the Company, as that term is hereafter defined.

            NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties as
follows:

                           1.  OPERATION OF AGREEMENT

            This Agreement shall be effective immediately upon its execution 
by the parties hereto, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, neither the Agreement nor any provision thereof shall be 
operative unless and until there has been a

<PAGE>

Change in Control of the Company, as defined in Section 17 below while the
Executive is in the employ of the Company.  Upon such a Change in Control of 
the Company, this Agreement and all provisions thereof shall become operative 
immediately. 

                           2.  EMPLOYMENT; PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT

2.01  The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, 
and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, for 
the period set forth in paragraph 2.02 below (the Period of Employment), in 
the position and with the duties and responsibilities set forth in Section 3 
below, and upon the other terms and conditions hereinafter stated.


2.02  The Period of Employment shall be deemed to have commenced on the 
date of this Agreement and, subject only to the provisions of Section 6 below,
relating to death or Disability, shall continue until the close of business on
the date stated in Exhibit A attached to and made part of this Agreement.  In 
the event that the Executive shall continue in the full-time employment of the
Company after the latter date, such continued employment shall be subject to 
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Period of Employment shall 
include the period during which the Executive in fact so continues in such 
employment.

                     3.  POSITION, DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES

3.01  (a)   It is contemplated that during the Period of Employment the 
Executive shall continue to serve as a principal officer of the Company with 
the office(s) and title(s),

of this Agreement, reporting as set in such Exhibit B and with duties and 
responsibilities including those specifically set forth in such Exhibit B.

      (b)   At all times during the Period of Employment, the Executive shall 
hold a position of responsibility and importance and a position of scope, with 
the functions, duties and responsibilities attached thereto, at least equal in 
responsibility and importance and in scope to and commensurate with his 
position on the date of this Agreement described in general terms in 
subparagraph 3.01(a) above.

3.02  During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall also serve 
and continue to serve, if and when elected and reelected, as an officer or 
director, or both, of any subsidiary, division or affiliate of the Company.

3.03  Throughout the Period of Employment the Executive shall devote his
full time and undivided attention during normal business hours to the business
and affairs of the Company, except for reasonable vacations and except for 
illness or incapacity, but nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the 
Executive from devoting reasonable periods required for serving as a director 
or member of a committee of any organization involving no conflict of interest
with the interests of the Company, from engaging in charitable and community 
activities, and from managing his personal investments, provided that such 
activities do not materially interfere with the regular performance of his 
duties and responsibilities under this Agreement.

to be absent therefrom on travel status or otherwise more than the total 
number of working days in any calendar year stated in such Exhibit C.

                4.  COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION PLANS, PERQUISITES

4.01  (a)   For all services rendered by the Executive in any capacity during 
the Period of Employment, including, without limitation, services as an

rate of no less than $_____________ per month, with such increases in such 
rate as shall be awarded from time to time in accordance with the Company's 
regular administrative practices of salary increases applicable to executives

           (ii)  An executive performance award or bonus under the Company's

dividing the award made for the fiscal year of the Company in which such month 
occurred by the number of months in such fiscal year, equal to no less than 
the amount set forth from 


                                     - 4 -

time to time in Exhibit D to this Agreement, which amount shall be equal to

to clause (i) of this subparagraph 4.01(a).

      (b)   Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph 4.01(a) 
above, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a change in the mix between 
the base salary and bonus of the Executive by increasing the base salary of 
the Executive.

      (c)   Any increase in salary pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph 
4.01(a) or in bonus or other compensation shall in no way diminish any other 
obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

4.02  During the Period of Employment the Executive shall be and continue to 
be a full participant in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, its 1977 
and 1982 Employees Stock Option Plan, or equivalent successor plans that may

have been heretofore provided.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude 
improvement of reward opportunities in such plans or other plans in accordance 
with the present practice of the Company.

4.03  During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be entitled 
to perquisites, including, without limitation, an office, secretarial and 
clerical staff, and to fringe benefits, including, without limitation, the 
business and personal use of an automobile and payment or reimbursement of 
club dues, in each case at least equal to those attached to his office on the 
date of this Agreement, as well as to reimbursement, upon proper accounting,
of reasonable expenses and disbursements incurred by him in the course of his 
duties.

                           5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

5.01  The compensation provided for in Section 4 above, together with 
other matters therein set forth, is in addition to the benefits provided for 
in this Section 5.

5.02  In the event that the Executive shall not heretofore have been 
designated a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits

of Employment to which officers of the Company, their dependents and 
beneficiaries are entitled as the result of the employment of such officers

practices of the Company, including, without limitation, the Company's

Benefits Program) the Company's stock purchase and savings, thrift and 
investment plans, if any, the Company's Group Life Insurance Plan, its 
accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability, medical, dental and

result of participation in such 


                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

plan or practice during the Period of Employment.

5.04  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from amending 
or terminating any employee benefit plan or practice, but, it being the intent 
of the parties that the Executive shall continue to be entitled during the 
Period of Employment to perquisites as set forth in paragraph 4.03 above, and 
to benefits and service credit for benefits under paragraph 5.03 above at 
least equal to those attached to his position on the date of this Agreement, 
nothing in this Agreement shall operate as, or be construed or reduce or 
authorize, a reduction without the Executive's written consent in the level of 
such perquisites, benefits or service credit for benefits; in the event of any 
such reduction, by amendment or termination of any plan or practice or 
otherwise, the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall continue to 
be entitled to perquisites, benefits and service credit for benefits at least 
equal to the perquisites and to benefits and service credit for benefits under 
such plans or practices that he or his dependents and beneficiaries would
have received if such reduction had not taken place.

                        6.  EFFECT OF DEATH OR DISABILITY

6.01  In the event of the death of the Executive during the Period of 
Employment, the legal representative of the Executive shall be entitled to the 
compensation provided for in paragraph 4.01 above for the month in which death 
shall have taken place at the rate being paid at the time of death, and the 
Period of Employment shall be deemed to have ended as of the close of business 
on the last day of the month in which death shall have occurred, but without 
prejudice to any payments due in respect of the Executive's death.

                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>

6.02  (a)   The term "Disability", as used in this Agreement, shall mean an 
illness or accident which prevents the Executive from performing his duties 
under this Agreement for a period of six consecutive months.  The Period of 
Employment shall be deemed to have ended as of the close of business on the 
last day of such six months period but without prejudice to any payments due 
the Executive in respect of disability.

      (b)   In the event of the Disability of the Executive during the Period 
of Employment, the Executive shall be paid an amount equal to the Minimum 
Total Monthly Compensation for the month in which such Disability commenced.  
Such amount shall be paid at the end of each month during the period of such 
Disability but not in excess of six months.

      (c)   The amount of any payments due under this paragraph 6.02 shall be 
reduced by any payments to which the Executive may be entitled for the same 
period because of disability under any disability or pension plan of the 
Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

                                 7.  TERMINATION

7.01  In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 below, 
during the Period of Employment, the provisions of this Section 7 shall apply.

7.02  In the event of a Termination and subject to the provisions of 
Section 8 of this Agreement relating to mitigation of damages and to 
compliance by the Executive with the provisions of paragraph 7.04 below, 
relating to Competition, and of Section 9 below, relating to confidential 
information, the Company shall, as liquidated damages or severance pay, or 


                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>

both, pay to the Executive and provide him, his dependents, beneficiaries and 
estate, with the following:

      (a)   The Company shall pay the Executive (i) the compensation provided 
in paragraph 4.01 above for the month in which Termination shall have occurred 
at the rate being paid at the time of Termination and (ii) during the 
remainder of the Period of Employment an amount equal to the total 
compensation provided in clause (ii) of subparagraph 4.01(a).  Such amount 
shall be paid in monthly installments at the end of each month commencing with 
the month next following the month in which Termination occurred and 
continuing during the remainder of the Period of Employment or through the 
month in which the death of the Executive shall have occurred if earlier.

      (b)   During the period that the payments provided for in subparagraph 
(a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made, the Executive, his 
dependents, beneficiaries and estate, shall continue to be entitled to all 
benefits and service credit for benefits under employee benefit plans of the 
Company as if still employed during such period under this Agreement and, if 
and to the extent that such benefits or service credit for benefits shall not 
be payable or provided under any such plans to the Executive, his dependents, 
beneficiaries and estate, by reason of his no longer being an employee of the 
Company as the result of Termination, the Company shall itself pay or provide 
for payment of such benefits and service credit for benefits to the Executive, 
his dependents, beneficiaries and estate. 

      (c)   The remainder of the period of Employment shall be considered 
service with the Company for the purpose (i) of continued credits under the 
Company's retirement program, (consisting of its Retirement Plan for Salaried 
Employees, its Excess Benefits Plan, if any, and its Supplemental Executive 
Retirement Benefits Program) as each such plan or 


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

program was in effect immediately prior to Termination and (ii) of all other 
benefit plans of the Company as in effect immediately prior to Termination. 

      (d)   In the event that the Executive shall at the time of Termination 
hold an outstanding and unexercised (whether or not exercisable at the time) 
option or options theretofore granted by the Company, the Company shall, in 
addition to the amounts provided for in subparagraphs 7.02(a) and 7.02(b), pay 
to the Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to the excess above the option 
price under each such option of the Fair Market Value at the time of 
Termination of the shares subject to each such option.  Solely for the purpose 
of this subparagraph (d), Fair Market Value at the time of Termination shall 
be deemed to mean the higher of (i) the average of the reported closing prices 
of the Common Shares of the Company, as reported on the New York Stock 
Exchange-Composite Transactions, on the last trading day prior to the 
Termination and on the last trading day of each of the two preceding thirty-
day periods, and (ii) in the event that a Change in Control, as defined in 
Section 17 below, prior to Termination shall have taken place as the result of 
a tender offer and such Change in Control was consummated within twelve months 
of Termination, the highest consideration paid for Common Shares of the 
Company in the course of such tender or exchange offer.  Upon receiving the 
payment from the Company called for by clause (i) of subparagraph (a) of this 
paragraph 7.02, the Executive shall execute and deliver to the Company a 
general release in favor of the Company, its successors and assigns, in 
respect of any and all matters, including, without limitation, any and all 
rights under any outstanding and unexercisable options at the time of 
Termination, except for the payments and obligations required to be made or 
assumed by the Company under this Agreement which at the time had not yet been 
made or assumed by the Company 


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>

and except for such other valid obligations of the Company as shall be set 
forth in such release.

7.03  The word "Termination", for the purpose of this Section 7 and any 
other provision of this Agreement, shall mean:

      (a)   Termination by the Company of the employment of the Executive by 
the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason other than for Cause as 
defined in paragraph 7.05 below or for Disability as defined in subparagraph 
6.02(a) above; or

      (b)   Termination by the Executive of his employment by the Company and 
its subsidiaries upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (i)   Failure to elect or reelect the Executive to, or removal of 
the Executive from, any of the offices described in paragraph 3.01 above.

           (ii)  A significant change in the nature or scope of the 
authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to the position summarized 
in paragraph 3.01 above, or a reduction in compensation, which is not remedied 
within 30 days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the 
Executive.

          (iii) A determination by the Executive made in good faith that as a 
result of a Change in Control of the Company, as defined in Section 17 below, 
and a change in circumstances thereafter and since the date of this Agreement 
significantly affecting his position, he is unable to carry out the 
authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to his position and 
contemplated by Section 3 of this Agreement and the situation is not remedied 
within 30 days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the 
Executive of such determination.


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

           (iv)  A breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement 
not embraced within the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this 
subparagraph 7.03(b) which is not remedied within 30 days after receipt by the 
company of written notice from the Executive.

            (v)  The liquidation, dissolution, consolidation or merger of the 
Company or transfer of all or a significant portion of its assets unless a 
successor or successors (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) to which all 
or a significant portion of its assets have been transferred shall have 
assumed all duties and obligations of the Company under this Agreement, 
provided, however, that in any event set forth in this subparagraph 7.03(b) 
above, the Executive shall have elected to terminate his employment under this 
Agreement upon not less than forty and not more than ninety days' advance 
written notice to the Board of Directors of the Company, Attention of the 
Secretary, given, except in the case of a continuing breach, within three 
calendar months after (A) failure to be so elected or reelected, or removal, 
(B) expiration of the thirty-day cure period with respect to such event, or 
(C) the closing date of such liquidation, dissolution, consolidation, merger 
or transfer of assets, as the case may be.


            An election by the Executive to terminate his employment given 
under the provisions of this paragraph 7.03 shall not be deemed a voluntary 
termination of employment by the Executive for the purpose of this Agreement 
or any plan or practice of the Company.

                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

7.04  (a)   There shall be no obligation on the part of the Company to make 
any further payments provided for in paragraph 7.02 above or to provide any 
further benefits specified in such paragraph 7.02 if the Executive shall, 
during the period that such payments are being made or benefits provided, 
engage in Competition with the Company as hereinafter defined, provided all of 
the following shall have taken place: 

            (i)   the Secretary of the Company, pursuant to resolution of the 
Board of Directors of the Company, shall have given written notice to the 
Executive that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, the Executive is 
engaged in such Competition, specifying the details;

           (ii)   the Executive shall have been give a reasonable opportunity 
to appear before the Board of Directors prior to the determination of the 
Board evidenced by such resolution; and

          (iii)   the Executive shall neither have ceased to engage in such 
Competition within thirty days from his receipt of such notice nor diligently 
taken all reasonable steps to that end during such thirty-day period and 
thereafter.

      (b)   The word "Competition" for purposes of this paragraph 7.04 and any
other provision of this Agreement shall mean taking a management position with
or control of a business engaged in the manufacture, processing, purchase of
distribution of products which constituted 15% or more of the sales of the
Company and its subsidiaries and divisions during the last fiscal year of the
Company preceding the termination of the Executive's employment (or during any
fiscal year of the Company during the Period of Employment); provided, 
however in no event shall ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding capital
stock entitled to vote for the election of directors of a corporation with a
class of  

                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

equity securities held of record by more than 500 persons, standing alone, be 
deemed Competition with the Company within the meaning of this paragraph 7.04.

7.05  For the purpose of any provision of this Agreement, the 
termination of the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been for 
Cause only 

      (a)   if termination of his employment shall have been the result of an 
act or acts of dishonesty on the part of the Executive constituting a felony 
and resulting or intended to result directly or indirectly in gain or personal 
enrichment at the expense of the Company, or

      (b)   if there has been a breach by the Executive during the Period of 
Employment of the provisions of paragraph 3.03 above, relating to the time to 
be devoted to the affairs of the Company, or of Section 9, relating to 
confidential information, and such breach results in demonstrably material 
injury to the Company, and with respect to any alleged breach of paragraph 
3.03 hereof, the Executive shall have both failed to remedy such alleged 
breach within thirty days from his receipt of written notice by the Secretary 
of the Company pursuant to resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors 
of the Company after notice to the Executive and an opportunity to be heard 
demanding that he remedy such alleged breach, and failed to take all 
reasonable steps to that end during such thirty-day period and thereafter; 
provided that there shall have been delivered to the Executive a certified 
copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted by the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of the entire membership of 
the Board of Directors called and held for that purpose and at which the 
Executive was given an opportunity to be heard, finding that the Executive was 
guilty of conduct set forth in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above, 


                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

specifying the particulars thereof in detail. 

            Anything in this paragraph 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement to 
the contrary notwithstanding, the employment of the Executive shall in no 
event be considered to have been terminated by the Company for Cause if 
termination of his employment took place (i) as the result of bad judgment or 
negligence on the part of the Executive, or (ii) as the result of an act or 
omission without intent of gaining therefrom directly or indirectly a profit 
to which the Executive was not legally entitled, or (iii) because of an act or 
omission believed by the Executive in good faith to have been in or not 
opposed to the interests of the Company, or (iv) for any act or omission in 
respect of which a determination could properly be made that the Executive met 
the applicable standard of conduct prescribed for indemnification or 
reimbursement or payment of expenses under the Code of Regulations of the 
Company or the laws of the State of Ohio or the directors' and officers' 
liability insurance of the Company, in each case as in effect at the time of 
such act or omission, or (v) as the result of an act or omission which 
occurred more than twelve calendar months prior to the Executive's having been 
given notice of the termination of his employment for such act or omission 
unless the commission of such act or such omission could not at the time of 
such commission or omission have been known to a member of the Board of 
Directors of the Company (other than the Executive, if he is then a member of 
the Board of Directors), in which case more than twelve calendar months from 
the date that the commission of such act or such omission was or could 
reasonably have been so known, or (vi) as the result of a continuing course of 
action which commenced and was or could reasonably have been known to a member 
of the Board of Directors of the Company (other than the Executive) more than 
twelve calendar months prior to notice having been given to 


                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

the Executive of the termination of his employment. 

7.06  In the event that the Executive's employment shall be terminated 
by the Company during the Period of Employment and such termination is alleged 
to be for Cause, or the Executive's right to terminate his employment under 
paragraph 7.03(b) above shall be questioned by the Company, or the Company 
shall withhold payments or provision of benefits because the Executive is 
alleged to be engaged in Competition in breach of the provisions of paragraph 
7.04 above or for any other reason, the Executive shall have the right, in 
addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law, at his election 
either to seek arbitration within the area described in Exhibit C attached 
hereto and made part of this Agreement under the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association by serving a notice to arbitrate upon the Company or 
to institute a judicial proceeding, in either case within ninety days after 
having received notice of termination of his employment or notice in any form 
that the termination of his employment under paragraph 7.03(b) is subject to 
question or that the Company is withholding or proposed to withhold payments 
or provision of benefits or within such longer period as may reasonably be 
necessary for the Executive to take action in the event that his illness or 
incapacity should preclude his taking such action within such ninety-day 
period.

                       8.  OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DAMAGES

8.01  In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 above, 
the Executive shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages by seeking 
other employment; provided, however, that he shall not be required to accept a 
position of less dignity and 


                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

importance or of substantially different character than the highest position 
theretofore held by him with the Company or a position that would call upon 
him to engage in competition within the meaning of paragraph 7.04(b) above, 
nor shall he be required to accept a position other than in a location 
reasonably convenient to his principal residence immediately prior to such 
Termination.

8.02  To the extent that the Executive shall receive compensation, 
benefits and service credit for benefits from other employment secured 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8.01 above, the payments to be made 
and the benefits and service credit for benefits to be provided by the Company 
under the provisions of paragraph 7.02 above shall be correspondingly reduced.  
Such reduction shall, in the event of any question, be determined jointly by 
the firm of certified public accountants selected by the Executive, in each 
case upon the advice of actuaries to the extent the certified public 
accountants consider necessary, and, in the event such accountants are unable  
to agree on a resolution of the question, such reduction shall be determined 
by an independent firm of certified public accountants selected jointly by 
both firms of accountants.

                          9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

9.01  The Executive agrees not to disclose, either while in the 
Company's employ or at any time thereafter, to any person not employed by the 
Company, or not engaged to render services to the Company, any confidential 
information obtained by him while in the employ of the Company, including, 
without limitation, any of the Company's inventions, processes, methods of 
distribution or customers or trade secrets; provided, however, that this 


                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>

provision shall not preclude the Executive from use or disclosure of 
information known generally to the public or of information not considered 
confidential by persons engaged in the business conducted by the Company or 
from disclosure required by law or Court order.

9.02  The Executive also agrees that upon leaving the Company's employ, 
he will not take with him, without the prior written consent of an officer  
authorized to act in the matter by the Board of Directors of the Company, any 
drawing, blueprint, specification or other document of the Company, its 
subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, which is of a confidential nature 
relating to the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, or 
without limitation, relating to its or their methods of distribution, or any 
description of any formulae or secret processes.

                            10.  SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE

            In the event that, following the specific date set forth in 
paragraph 2.02 of this Agreement, the employment of the Executive shall be 
terminated by the Company prior to his normal retirement date and such 
termination shall be for any reason other than for Cause, as defined in 
paragraph 7.05 above, the Company shall pay the Executive as a severance 
allowance a lump sum equal to 50% of his annual compensation for one year, 
consisting of base salary at the rate paid for the month prior to such 
termination of employment plus his most recent executive performance award of 
bonus under the Company's annual incentive plan.

            Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to 
be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive or his estate or 
beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, 
relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably 
determine it should withhold pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.  In 
lieu of withholding such amounts, the Company may accept other provisions to 
the end that it has sufficient funds to pay all taxes required by law to be 
withheld in respect of any or all of such payments.

                                  12.  NOTICES

time to time in Exhibit E to this Agreement which address shall be such 
address as the addressee may have given most recently by a similar notice.  
Any such notice, request, demand or other communication delivered in person

13.02  The Company and the Executive recognize that each party will have 
no adequate remedy at law for breach by the other of any of the agreements

Executive hereby agree and consent that the other shall be entitled to a 
decree of specific performance, mandamus or other appropriate remedy to 
enforce performance of such agreements.

13.03  No right or interest to or in any payments shall be assignable by 
the Executive; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude him 
from designating one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be

estate from assigning any right hereunder to the person or persons entitled 
thereto under his will or, in the case of intestacy, to the person or persons 
entitled thereto under the laws of intestacy applicable to his estate.  The

beneficiaries so designated to receive any such amount or, if no beneficiary

execution, attachment, levy or similar process, or assignment by operation of 
law.  Any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to effect any action specified in 
the immediately preceding sentence shall, to the full extent permitted by law,

convenience and no provision of this Agreement is to be construed by reference 
to the title of any section.

benefit of the Executive, his heirs and legal representatives, and the Company 
and its successors as provided in Section 16 hereof.

                     14.  AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION; WAIVER

            No provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived 
unless such amendment, modification or waiver shall be authorized by the Board 
of Directors of the Company or any authorized committee of the Board of 
Directors and shall be agreed to in writing, signed by the Executive and by an 
officer of the Company thereunto duly authorized.  Except as otherwise 
specifically provided in this Agreement, no waiver by either party hereto of 
any breach by the other party hereto of any condition or provision of this 
Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of a 
subsequent breach of such condition or provision or a waiver of a similar or 
dissimilar provision or condition at the same or at any prior or subsequent 
time.

shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or 
in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement and parts of such 
provision not so invalid or unenforceable shall be unaffected thereby and 
shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of the  
Company, including, without limitation, any corporation or corporations 
acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company whether by merger, consolidation, sale or otherwise (and such 
successor shall thereafter be deemed "the Company" for the purposes of this 
Agreement), but shall not otherwise be assignable by the Company.

                             17.  CHANGE IN CONTROL

used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) is 
or becomes a beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the 
Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's

            AGREEMENT between PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION, an Ohio
Corporation (the Company), and ___________________ (the Executive), dated the 
_____ day of _______________, 1988.

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
            WHEREAS:

            A.    The Executive is a principal officer of the Company and an 
integral part of its management.

            B.    The Company wishes to assure both itself and the Executive 
of continuity of management in the event of any actual or threatened change 
in control of the Company.

            C.    This agreement is not intended to alter materially the 
compensation and benefits that the Executive could reasonably expect in the 
absence of a change in control of the Company and, accordingly, this 
Agreement, though taking effect upon execution thereof, will be operative 
only upon a change in control of the Company, as that term is hereafter 
defined.

            NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties as
follows:

                           1.  OPERATION OF AGREEMENT

            This Agreement shall be effective immediately upon its execution 
by the parties hereto, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, neither this Agreement nor any provision thereof, except for 
this Section 1, Sections 14 through 18 


<PAGE>

inclusive, paragraph 13.01, paragraphs 13.07 through 13.10 inclusive, and 
provisions of subparagraphs 3.01 (a)(ii), 3.04(b) and 4.01(b) and of Section 
12 providing for automatic updating of Exhibits B, D, E and F from time to 
time prior to the date this Agreement becomes operative, shall be operative 
unless and until there has been a Change in Control of the Company as defined 
in Section 17 below while the Executive is in the employ of the Company.  
Upon such a Change in Control of the Company, this Agreement and all 
provisions thereof shall become operative immediately.

                      2.  EMPLOYMENT; PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT

2.01        The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its 
employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the 
Company, for the period set forth in paragraph 2.02 below (the Period of 
Employment), in the position and with the duties and responsibilities set 
forth in Section 3 below, and upon the other terms and conditions hereinafter 
stated.

2.02        The Period of Employment shall commence on the date this 
Agreement becomes operative pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 above 
(the Operative Date) and, subject only to the provisions of Section 6 below, 
relating to death or Disability, shall continue until the close of business 
on the date stated in Exhibit A attached to and made part of this Agreement.  
In the event that the Executive shall continue in the full-time employment of 
the Company after the latter date, such continued employment shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Period of Employment
shall   


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

include the period during which the Executive in fact so continues in such
employment. 

                     3.  POSITION, DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES

3.01  (a)   (i)   It is contemplated that during the Period of Employment the 
Executive shall continue to serve as a principal officer of the Company and 
as a member of its Board of Directors if serving as a member of its Board of 
Directors immediately prior to the Operative Date, with the office(s) and 
title(s), reporting responsibility, and duties and responsibilities of the 
Executive immediately prior to the Operative Date. 

           (ii)  The office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, duties 
and responsibilities of the Executive on the date of this Agreement, as the 
same may be changed from time to time prior to the Operative Date, shall be 
summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement to the end that, if this Agreement 
becomes operative pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 above, Exhibit B 
will reflect accurately the office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, 
duties and responsibilities of the Executive immediately prior to the 
Operative Date, it being understood and agreed that if, as and when the 
office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, duties or responsibilities of 
the Executive shall be changed prior to the Operative Date, Exhibit B shall 
be deemed to be and shall be updated by the parties to reflect such change; 
provided, however, that Exhibit B is intended only as a memorandum for the 
convenience of the parties and shall be disregarded if and to the extent 
that, on the Operative Date, Exhibit B shall fail to reflect accurately the 
office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, duties or responsibilities of 
the Executive immediately prior to the Operative Date because the parties 
shall have failed to update Exhibit B as contemplated hereby. 


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

      (b)   At all times during the Period of Employment, the Executive shall 
hold a position of responsibility and importance and a position of scope, 
with the functions, duties and responsibilities attached thereto, at least 
equal in responsibility and importance and in scope to and commensurate with 
his position described in general terms in subparagraph 3.01(a) above and 
intended to be summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

3.02        During the Period of Employment the Executive shall also serve 
and continue to serve, if and when elected and reelected, as an officer or 
director, or both, of any subsidiary, division or affiliate of the Company.

3.03        Throughout the Period of Employment the Executive shall devote 
his full time and undivided attention during normal business hours to the 
business and affairs of the Company, except for reasonable vacations and 
except for illness or incapacity, but nothing in this Agreement shall 
preclude the Executive from devoting reasonable periods required for serving 
as a director or member of a committee of any organization involving no 
conflict of interest with the interests of the Company, from engaging in 
charitable and community activities, and from managing his personal 
investments, provided that such activities do not materially interfere with 
the regular performance of his duties and responsibilities under this 
Agreement.

3.04  (a)   The office of the Executive shall be located at the principal 
offices of the Company within the area within which the office of the 
Executive is located immediately 


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

prior to the Operative Date, and the Executive shall not be required to 
locate his office elsewhere without his prior written consent, nor shall he 
be required to be absent therefrom on travel status or otherwise more than 
the total number of working days in any calendar year stated in Exhibit C 
attached to and made part of this Agreement nor more than the number of 
consecutive days at any one time stated in such Exhibit C.

      (b)   The area within which the office of the Executive is located on 
the date of this Agreement, as the same may be changed from time to time 
prior to the Operative Date, shall be described in Exhibit D to this 
Agreement to the end that, if this Agreement becomes operative pursuant to 
the provisions of Section 1 above, Exhibit D will reflect accurately the area 
within which the office of the Executive was located immediately prior to the 
Operative Date, it being understood and agreed that if, as and when the area 
within which the office of the Executive is located shall be changed prior to 
the Operative Date, Exhibit D shall be deemed to be and shall be updated by 
the parties to reflect such change; provided, however, that Exhibit D is 
intended only as a memorandum for the convenience of the parties and shall be 
disregarded if and to the extent that, on the Operative Date, Exhibit D shall 
fail to reflect accurately the area within which the office of the Executive 
was located immediately prior to the Operative Date because the parties shall 
have failed to update Exhibit D as contemplated hereby.

                4.  COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION PLANS, PERQUISITES

4.01  (a)   For all services rendered by the Executive in any capacity during 
the Period of Employment, including, without limitation, services as an 
executive, officer, director or 


                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>
member of any committee of the Company or of any subsidiary, division or 
affiliate thereof, the Executive shall be paid as compensation:

            (i)   A base salary, payable not less often than monthly, at a 
monthly rate (before reduction for any deduction including, without 
limitation, any deduction for withholding of income taxes or F.I.C.A. taxes 
and any deduction pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954 as amended) at least equal to the monthly rate (before reduction for any 
such deduction) of salary which was payable to the Executive immediately 
prior to the Operative Date, with increases in such rate after the Operative 
Date in accordance with the Company's regular administrative practices, 
relating to salary increases applicable to executives of the Company, in 
effect immediately prior to the Operative Date (the Minimum Base Salary), and

            (ii)  An executive performance award or bonus under the Company's
Executive Compensation Plan, or such equivalent successor plan as may be 
adopted by the Company, upon a basis that will render an executive 
performance award or bonus for each calendar month which is within the 
calendar year to which such executive performance award or bonus relates, and 
within the Period of Employment or within the calendar year in which the 
Period of Employment commences, equal to no less than the highest executive 
performance award or bonus awarded by the Company to the Executive (whether 
on a current or deferred payment basis) prior to the Operative Date, divided 
by twelve (the Minimum Monthly Bonus), so that total compensation for any 
such calendar month (the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation) shall consist of 
the Minimum Base Salary for such month provided for in clause (i) if this 
subparagraph 4.01(a), plus the Minimum Monthly 


                                    - 6 -
<PAGE>

Bonus for such month provided for in clause (ii) of this subparagraph 
4.01(a).

      (b)   The Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that is applicable from 
time to time after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of 
subparagraph 4.01(a) above, or that would be applicable if this Agreement 
were operative at such time, shall be set forth in Exhibit E to this 
Agreement, the intent of this subparagraph 4.01(b) being that such Exhibit E 
shall be deemed to be and shall be updated from time to time after the date 
of this Agreement, whether or not this Agreement shall then be operative, to 
reflect the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that applies at the time, or 
that would apply at the time if this Agreement were then operative, provided, 
however, that such Exhibit E is intended only as a memorandum for the 
convenience of the parties hereto and, in the event that there is at any time 
any conflict, disparity or discrepancy between the Minimum Total Monthly 
Compensation provided by subparagraph 4.01(a) above and the amount then set 
forth in Exhibit E hereto, the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a) shall in 
all events control. 

      (c)   Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a) above relating 
to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation, nothing in this Agreement shall 
preclude a change in the mix between the Minimum Base Salary and Minimum 
Monthly Bonus of the Executive by increasing the Minimum Base Salary of the 
Executive.

      (d)   Any increase in salary pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph 
4.01(a) or in bonus or other compensation shall in no way diminish any other 
obligation of the Company under this Agreement.


4.02  (a)   During the Period of Employment the Executive shall be and 
continue to be 


                                     - 7 -

a full participant in the Company's Executive Compensation Plan, Deferred 
Compensation Plan, any Employees Stock Option Plan, including its 1977 
Employees Stock Option Plan and 1977 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan and its 
1982 Employees Stock Option Plan, or equivalent successor plans that may be 
adopted by the Company, with at least the same reward opportunities as shall 
have been provided immediately prior to the Operative Date.  Nothing in this 
Agreement shall preclude improvement of reward opportunities in such plans or 
other plans in accordance with the practice of the Company immediately prior 
to the Operative Date.

      (b)   Any provision of the Company's Executive Compensation Plan (or 
any successor plan) to the contrary notwithstanding, any executive 
performance award or bonus awarded to the Executive during the Period of 
Employment (whether for services rendered during or prior to the Period of 
Employment) shall, unless the Executive shall have approved otherwise in 
writing, be paid wholly in cash as soon as practicable after the awards are 
made.

4.03        During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be entitled 
to perquisites, including, without limitation, an office, secretarial and 
clerical staff, and to fringe benefits, including, without limitation, the 
business and personal use of an automobile and payment or reimbursement of 
club dues, in each case at least equal to those attached to his office 
immediately prior to the Operative Date, as well as to reimbursement, upon 
proper accounting, of reasonable expenses and disbursements incurred by him 
in the course of his duties.

                           5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

5.01        The compensation provided for in Section 4 above, together with 
other matters therein set forth, is in addition to the benefits provided for 
in this Section 5. 

5.02        In the event that the Executive shall not have been designated a 
Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Program of the 
Company prior to the Operative Date, the Executive shall be and hereby is 
designated, on and as of the Operative Date, a Participant in that Program as 
in effect immediately prior to the Operative Date. 

5.03        The Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall be entitled 
to all payments and benefits and service credit for benefits during the 
Period of Employment to which officers of the Company, their dependents and 
beneficiaries are entitled as the result of the employment of such officers 
during the Period of Employment under the terms of employee plans and 
practices of the Company, including, without limitation, the Company's 
retirement program (consisting of its Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, 
its Excess Benefits Plan, if any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program), the Company's stock purchase and savings, thrift and 
investment plans, if any, its Group Life Insurance Plan, its accidental death 
and dismemberment insurance, disability, medical, dental and health and 
welfare plans and other preset or equivalent successor plans and practices of 
the Company, its subsidiaries and divisions, for which officers, their 
dependents and beneficiaries are eligible, and to all payments or other 
benefits under any such plan or practice after the Period of Employment as a 
result of participation in such plan or practice 


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

during the Period of Employment.

5.04        Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from 
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or practice, but, it being 
the intent of the parties that the Executive shall continue to be entitled 
during the Period of Employment to perquisites as set forth in paragraph 4.03 
above and to benefits and service credit for benefits under paragraph 5.03 
above at least equal to those attached to his position immediately prior to 
the Operative Date, nothing in this Agreement shall operate as, or be 
construed to reduce or authorize, a reduction without the Executive's written 
consent in the level of such perquisites, benefits or service credit for 
benefits; in the event of any such reduction, by amendment or termination of 
any plan or practice or otherwise, the Executive, his dependents and 
beneficiaries shall continue to be entitled to perquisites, benefits and 
service credit for benefits at least equal to the perquisites and to benefits  
and service credit for benefits under such plans or practices that he or his 
dependents and beneficiaries would have received if such reduction had not 
taken place.

                        6.  EFFECT OF DEATH OR DISABILITY

6.01        In the event of the death of the Executive during the Period of 
Employment, the legal representative of the Executive shall be entitled to the  
Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the month in which death shall have 
occurred, and the Period of Employment shall be deemed to have ended as of 
the close of business on the last day of such month but without prejudice to 
any payments due in respect of the Executive's death. 


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>

6.02  (a)   The term "Disability", as used in this Agreement, shall mean an 
illness or accident which prevents the Executive from performing his duties 
under this Agreement for a period of six consecutive months.  The Period of 
Employment shall be deemed to have ended as of the close of business on the 
last day of such six-month period but without prejudice to any payments due 
the Executive in respect of disability.

      (b)   In the event of the Disability of the Executive during the Period 
of Employment, the Executive shall be paid an amount, equal to the Minimum 
Total Monthly Compensation for the month in which such Disability commenced, 
at the end of each month during the period of such Disability but not in 
excess of six months.

      (c)   The amount of any payments due under this paragraph 6.02 shall be 
reduced by any payments to which the Executive may be entitled for the same 
period because of disability under any disability or pension plan of the 
Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

                                 7.  TERMINATION

7.01        In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 
below, during the Period of Employment, the provisions of this Section 7 
shall apply.

7.02        In the event of a Termination and subject to the provisions of 
Section 8 of this Agreement, relating to mitigation of damages, and to 
compliance by the Executive with the provisions of paragraph 7.04 below, 
relating to Competition, and of Section 9 below, relating to confidential 
information, the Company shall, as liquidated damages or severance pay, or 


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

both, pay to the Executive and provide him, his dependents, beneficiaries and 
estate, with the following:

      (a)   The Company shall pay the Executive an amount equal to the 
Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that would have been paid to the Executive 
for the month in which Termination occurred had such Termination not 
occurred,
            (i)   at the end of the month in which Termination occurred, and
            (ii)  at the end of each month thereafter during the remainder of 
the Period of Employment, 

provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required to pay such 
an amount after the month in which the death of the Executive shall have 
occurred or after the twelfth month following the occurrence of an illness or 
accident which would constitute a "Disability" under subparagraph 6.02(b) 
above in the absence of such Termination.

      (b)   During the period that the payments provided for in subparagraph 
(a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made, the Executive, his 
dependents, beneficiaries and estate, shall continue to be entitled to all 
benefits and service credit for benefits under employee benefit plans of the 
Company as if still employed during such period under this Agreement and, if 
and to the extent that such benefits or service credit for benefits shall not 
be payable or provided under any such plans to the Executive, his dependents, 
beneficiaries and estate, by reason of his no longer being an employee of the 
Company as the result of Termination, the Company shall itself pay or provide 
for payment of such benefits and service credit for benefits to the 
Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate. 

      (c)   The period in which the payments provided for in subparagraph 
(a) of this 


                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

paragraph 7.02 are required to be made shall be considered service with the 
Company for the purpose (i) of continued credits under the Company's 
retirement program (consisting of its Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, 
its Excess Benefits Plan, if any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program) as each such plan or program was in effect immediately 
prior to Termination (but without giving effect to any reduction of benefits 
thereunder as the result of amendment or termination of any such Plan or 
Program during the Period of Employment) and (ii) of all other benefit plans  
of the Company as in effect immediately prior to Termination.

      (d)   In the event that the Executive shall at the time of Termination 
hold an outstanding and unexercised (whether or not exercisable at the time) 
non-statutory stock option or options theretofore granted by the Company, the 
Company shall, in addition to the amounts provided for in subparagraphs 
7.02(a) and 7.02(b), pay to the Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to 
the excess above the option price under each such non-statutory stock option 
of the Fair Market Value at the time of Termination of the shares subject to 
each such non-statutory stock option.  Solely for the purpose of this 
subparagraph (d), Fair Market Value at the time of Termination shall be 
deemed to mean the higher of (i) the average of the reported closing prices 
of the Common Shares of the Company, as reported on the New York Stock 
Exchange-Composite Transactions, on the last trading day prior to the 
Termination and on the last trading day of each of the two preceding thirty-
day periods, and (ii) in the event that a Change in Control, as defined in  
Section 17 below, prior to Termination shall have taken place as the result 
of a tender or exchange offer and such Change in Control was consummated 
within twelve months of Termination, the highest 


                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

consideration paid for Common Shares of the Company in the course of such 
tender or exchange offer.  Upon receiving the payment from the Company called 
for by clause (i) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 7.02, the Executive 
shall execute and deliver to the Company a general release in favor of the 
Company, its successors and assigns, in respect of any and all matters, 
including, without limitation, any and all rights under any outstanding and 
unexercisable non-statutory stock options at the time of Termination, except 
for the payments and obligations required to be made or assumed by the 
Company under this Agreement which at the time had not yet been made or 
assumed by the Company and except for such other valid obligations of the 
Company as shall be set forth in such release. 

      (e)   If as a result of a termination of employment pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraph 7.03(b), the Executive (or anyone claiming under or 
through him) loses any part or all of the benefits he would have received as 
a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Program of 
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Operative Date, the Company 
will provide him with a substantially equivalent benefit. 

7.03        The work "Termination", for the purpose of this Section 7 and any 
other provision of this Agreement, shall mean:

      (a)   Termination by the Company of the employment of the Executive by 
the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason other than for Cause as 
defined in paragraph 7.05 below or for Disability as defined in subparagraph 
6.02(a) above; or

      (b)   Termination by the Executive of his employment by the Company and 
its subsidiaries upon the occurrence of any of the following events:


                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

            (i)   Failure to elect or reelect the Executive to the Board of 
Directors of the Company, if the Executive shall have been a member of the 
Board of Directors immediately prior to the Operative Date, or failure to 
elect or reelect the Executive to, or removal of the Executive from, any of 
the office(s) described in paragraph 3.01(a)(i) above and intended to be 
summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

            (ii)  A significant change in the nature or scope of the 
authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to the position described 
in paragraph 3.01(a)(i) above and intended to be summarized in Exhibit B to 
this Agreement, or a reduction in compensation, which is not remedied within 
30 days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the Executive.

            (iii) A determination by the Executive made in good faith that as 
a result of a Change in Control of the Company, as defined in Section 17 
below, and a change in circumstances on or after the Operative Date 
significantly affecting his position, he is unable to carry out the 
authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to his position and 
contemplated by Section 3 of this Agreement and the situation is not remedied 
within 30 days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the 
Executive of such determination.

            (iv)  A breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement 
not embraced within the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this 
subparagraph 7.03(b) which is not remedied within 30 days after receipt by 
the Company of written notice from the Executive.

            (v)   The liquidation, dissolution, consolidation or merger of 
the Company 


                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

or transfer of all or a significant portion of its assets unless a successor 
or successors (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) to which all or a 
significant portion of its assets have been transferred shall have assumed 
all duties and obligations of the Company under this Agreement; provided that 
in any event set forth in this subparagraph 7.03(b) above, the Executive 
shall have elected to terminate his employment under this Agreement upon not 
less than forty and not more than ninety days' advance written notice to the 
Board of Directors of the Company, Attention of the Secretary, given, except 
in the case of a continuing breach, within three calendar months after (A) 
failure to be so elected or reelected, or removal, (B) expiration of the 
thirty-day cure period with respect to such event, or (C) the closing date of 
such liquidation, dissolution, consolidation, merger or transfer of assets, 
as the case may be.

            An election by the Executive to terminate his employment given 
under the provisions of this paragraph 7.03 shall not be deemed a voluntary 
termination of employment by the Executive for the purpose of this Agreement 
or any plan or practice of the Company.

7.04  (a)   There shall be no obligation on the part of the Company to make 
any further payments provided for in paragraph 7.02 above or to provide any 
further benefits specified in such paragraph 7.02 if the Executive shall, 
during the period that such payments are being made or benefits provided, 
engage in Competition with the Company as hereinafter defined, provided all 
of the following shall have taken place:

            (i)   the Secretary of the Company, pursuant to resolution of 
the Board of 

                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

Directors of the Company, shall have given written notice to the 
Executive that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, the Executive is 
engaged in such Competition, specifying the details;

            (ii)  the Executive shall have been given a reasonable 
opportunity to appear before the Board of Directors prior to the 
determination of the Board evidenced by such resolution;

            (iii) the Executive shall neither have ceased to engage in such 
Competition within thirty days from his receipt of such notice nor diligently 
taken all reasonable steps to that end during such thirty-day period and 
thereafter.

      (b)   The word "Competition" for purposes of this paragraph 7.04 and 
any other provision of this Agreement shall mean taking a management position 
with, or control of, a business engaged in the manufacture, processing, 
purchase of distribution of products which constituted 15% or more of the 
sales of the Company and its subsidiaries and divisions during the last 
fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of the Executive's 
employment (or during any fiscal year of the Company during the Period of 
Employment); provided, however, that in no event shall ownership of less than 
5% of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of 
directors of a corporation with a class of equity securities held of record 
by more than 500 persons, standing alone, be deemed Competition with the 
Company within the meaning of this paragraph 7.04.

7.05        For the purpose of any provision of this Agreement, the 
termination of the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been for Cause
only

                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>

      (a)   if termination of his employment shall have been the result of an 
act or acts of dishonesty on the part of the Executive constituting a felony 
and resulting or intended to result directly or indirectly in gain or 
personal enrichment at the expense of the Company, or

      (b)   if there has been a breach by the Executive during the Period of 
Employment of the provisions of paragraph 3.03 above, relating to the time to 
be devoted to the affairs of the Company, or of Section 9, relating to 
confidential information, and such breach results in demonstrably material 
injury to the Company, and with respect to any alleged breach of paragraph 
3.03 hereof, the Executive shall have both failed to remedy such alleged 
breach within thirty days from his receipt of written notice by the Secretary 
of the Company pursuant to resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors 
of the Company after notice to the Executive and an opportunity to be heard 
demanding that he remedy such alleged breach, and failed to take all 
reasonable steps to that end during such thirty-day period and thereafter; 
provided that there shall have been delivered to the Executive a certified 
copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted by the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of the entire membership of 
the Board of Directors called and held for that purpose and at which the 
Executive was given an opportunity to be heard, finding that the Executive 
was guilty of conduct set forth in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above, specifying 
the particulars thereof in detail.

            Anything in this paragraph 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement to 
the contrary notwithstanding, the employment of the Executive shall in no 
event be considered to have been terminated by the Company for Cause if 
termination of his employment took place (i) 


                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>

as the result of bad judgment or negligence on the part of the Executive, or 
(ii) as the result of an act or omission without intent of gaining therefrom 
directly or indirectly a profit to which the Executive was not legally 
entitled, or (iii) because of an act or omission believed by the Executive in 
good faith to have been in or not opposed to the interests of the Company, or 
(iv) for any act or omission in respect of which a determination could 
properly be made that the Executive met the applicable standard of conduct 
prescribed for indemnification or reimbursement or payment of expenses under 
the Code of Regulations of the Company or the laws of the State of Ohio or 
the directors' and officers' liability insurance of the Company, in each case 
as in effect at the time of such act or omission, or (v) as the result of an 
act or omission which occurred more than twelve calendar months prior to the 
Executive's having been given notice of the termination of his employment for 
such act or omission unless the commission of such act or such omission could 
not at the time of such commission or omission have been known to a member of 
the Board of Directors of the Company (other than the Executive, if he is 
then a member of the Board of Directors), in which case more than twelve 
calendar months from the date that the commission of such act or such 
omission was or could reasonably have been so known, or (vi) as the result of 
a continuing course of action which commenced and was or could  reasonably 
have been known to a member of the Board of Directors of the Company (other 
than the Executive) more than twelve calendar months prior to notice having 
been given to the Executive of the termination of his employment.

<PAGE>

7.06        In the event that the Executive's employment shall be terminated 
by the Company during the Period of Employment and such termination is 
alleged to be for Cause, or the Executive's right to terminate his employment 
under paragraph 7.03(b) above shall be questioned by the Company, or the 
Company shall withhold payments or provision of benefits because the 
Executive is alleged to be engaged in Competition in breach of the provisions 
of paragraph 7.04 above or for any other reason, the Executive shall have the 
right, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law, at his 
election either to seek arbitration within the area within which the office 
of the Executive was located immediately prior to the Operative Date and 
intended to be described in Exhibit D to this Agreement under the rules of 
the American Arbitration Association by serving a notice to arbitrate upon 
the Company or to institute a judicial proceeding, in either case within 
ninety days after having received notice of termination of his employment or 
notice in any form that the termination of his employment under paragraph 
7.03(b) is subject to question or that the Company is withholding or proposed 
to withhold payments or provision of benefits or within such longer period as 
may reasonably be necessary for the Executive to take action in the event 
that his illness or incapacity should preclude his taking such action within 
such ninety-day period.

7.07        Any provision above in this Section 7 to the contrary 
notwithstanding, if the Company should default on any obligation set forth in 
this Section 7 and shall have failed to remedy such default within thirty 
(30) days after having received written notice of such default from the 
Executive or his beneficiaries, then, in that event:

                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

      (a)   any and all undischarged, future obligations of the Company under 
this Section 7 shall, at the sole option of the Executive or his 
beneficiaries, exercised in writing signed by the Executive or his 
beneficiaries, as the case may be, and delivered to the Company within ninety 
days after the expiration of such thirty-day period, become immediately due 
and payable in a lump sum discounted to present value using the "Federal 
short-term rate", "Federal mid-term rate" or "Federal long-term rate" that 
would apply at the time under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 as amended (the "Code") to a debt instrument having a term equal to the 
period extending from the date such option is exercised in writing to the 
date or dates such future obligations of the Company would otherwise have 
become due and payable; and 

      (b)   in addition to, and not in substitution for, interest for any 
other period properly payable to the Executive as a result of such default, 
the Company agrees to pay pre-judgment interest on any such obligation in 
default, calculated at the "Federal short-term rate", "Federal mid-term rate" 
or "Federal long-term rate" that would apply at the time under section 
1274(d) of the Code to a debt instrument having a term equal to the period 
extending from the date that the Company's obligation became due and payable 
hereunder to the date the Executive or his beneficiaries obtain a money 
judgment therefor (whether in litigation or arbitration).

                       8.  OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DAMAGES

8.01        In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 
above, the Executive shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages by 
seeking other employment; 

                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>

provided, however, that he shall not be required to accept a position of less 
dignity and importance or of substantially different character than the 
highest position theretofore held by him with the Company or a position that 
would call upon him to engage in competition within the meaning of paragraph 
7.04(b) above, nor shall he be required to accept a position other than in a 
location reasonably convenient to his principal residence immediately prior 
to such Termination.

8.02        To the extent that the Executive shall receive compensation, 
benefits and service credit for benefits from other employment secured 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8.01 above, the payments to be made 
and the benefits and service credit for benefits to be provided by the 
Company under the provisions of paragraph 7.02 above shall be correspondingly 
reduced.  Such reduction shall, in the event of any question, be determined 
jointly by the firm of certified public accountants of the Company and the 
firm of certified public accountants selected by the Executive, in each case 
upon the advice of actuaries to the extent the certified public accountants 
consider necessary, and, in the event such accountants are unable to agree on 
a resolution of the question, such reduction shall be determined by an 
independent firm of certified public accountants selected jointly by both 
firms of accountants.

                          9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

9.01        The Executive agrees not to disclose, either while in the 
Company's employ or at any time thereafter, to any person not employed by the 
Company, or not engaged to 


                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>

render services to the Company, any confidential information obtained by him 
while in the employ of the Company, including, without limitation, any of the 
Company's inventions, processes, methods of distribution, customers or trade 
secrets; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude the 
Executive from use or disclosure of information known generally to the public 
or of information not considered confidential by persons engaged in the 
business conducted by the Company or from disclosure required by law or Court 
order. 

9.02        The Executive also agrees that upon leaving the Company's employ, 
he will not take with him, without the prior written consent of an officer 
authorized to act in the matter by the Board of Directors of the Company, any 
drawing, blueprint, specification or other document of the Company, its 
subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, which is of a confidential nature 
relating to the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, or 
without limitation, relating to its or their methods of distribution, or any 
description of any formulae or secret processes.

                            10.  SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE

            In the event that, following the date stated in Exhibit A 
attached to and made part of this Agreement, the employment of the Executive 
shall be terminated by the Company prior to his normal retirement date and 
such termination shall be for any reason other than for Cause, as defined in 
paragraph 7.05 above, the Company shall pay the Executive as a severance 
allowance a lump sum equal to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the 
month prior to such termination of employment, multiplied by six.

                                11.  WITHHOLDING

            Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required 
to be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive or his estate or 
beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, 
relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably 
determine it should withhold pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.  
In lieu of withholding such amounts, the Company may accept other provisions 
to the end that it has sufficient funds to pay all taxes required by law to

                             13.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

13.01       This Agreement is not intended to and shall not infer or imply 
any right on the part of the Executive to continue in the employ of the 
Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, prior to a Change in 
Control of the Company, and is not intended in any way to limit the right of 
the Company to terminate the employment of the Executive, with or without 
assigning a reason therefor, at any time prior to a Change in Control of the 
Company.  Nor is this Agreement intended to nor shall it infer or imply any 
obligation on the part of the Executive to continue in the employment of the 
Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, prior to a Change in 
Control of the Company. Neither the Company nor the Executive shall incur any 
liability under this Agreement if the employment of the Executive shall be 
terminated by the Company or by the Executive prior to a Change in Control of 
the Company.

13.02       There shall be no right of set-off or counter-claim, in respect 
of any claim, debt or obligation, against any payments to the Executive, his 
dependents, beneficiaries or 


                                     - 25 -
<PAGE>

estate provided for in this Agreement.

13.03       The Company and the Executive recognize that each party will have 
no adequate remedy at law for breach by the other of any of the agreements 
contained herein and, in the event of any such breach, the Company and the 
Executive hereby agree and consent that the other shall be entitled to a 
decree of specific performance, mandamus or other appropriate remedy to 
enforce performance of such agreements.

13.04       No right or interest to or in any payments shall be assignable by 
the Executive; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude him  
from designating one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be 
payable after his death and shall not preclude the legal representative of 
his estate from assigning any right hereunder to the person or persons 
entitled thereto under his will or, in the case of intestacy, to the person 
or persons entitled thereto under the laws of intestacy applicable to his 
estate.  The term "beneficiaries" as used in this Agreement shall mean a 
beneficiary or beneficiaries so designated to receive any such amount or, if 
no beneficiary has been so designated, the legal representative of the 
Executive's estate.

13.05       No right, benefit or interest hereunder, shall be subject to 
anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge,  
hypothecation, or set-off in respect of any claim, debt or obligation, or to 
execution, attachment, levy or similar process, or assignment by operation of 
law.  Any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to effect any action specified 
in the immediately preceding sentence shall, to the full extent permitted by
law, be null, void and of no effect.

13.06       In the event of the Executive's death or a judicial determination 
of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to the Executive shall be 
deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his legal representative, or, where 
appropriate, to his beneficiary or beneficiaries.

13.07       If any event provided for in this Agreement is scheduled to take 
place on a legal holiday, such event shall take place on the next succeeding 
day that is not a legal holiday.

13.08       The titles to sections in this Agreement are intended solely for 
convenience and no provision of this Agreement is to be construed by 
reference to the title of any section.

13.09       This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the 
benefit of the Executive, his heirs and legal representatives, and the Company  
and its successors as provided in Section 16 hereof.

13.10       This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties 
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes and replaces  
all prior agreements and understandings with respect to such subject matter, 
and the parties hereto have made no agreements, representations or warranties 
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement which are not set forth 
herein.

                     14.  AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION; WAIVER

            No provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived 
unless such amendment, modification or waiver shall be authorized by the 
Board of Directors of the Company or any authorized committee of the Board of 
Directors and shall be agreed to in writing, signed by the Executive and by 
an officer of the Company thereunto duly authorized.  Except as otherwise 
specifically provided in this Agreement, no waiver by either party hereto of 
any breach by the other party hereto of any condition or provision of this 
Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of a 
subsequent breach of such condition or provision or a waiver of a similar or 
dissimilar provision or condition at the same or at any prior or subsequent 
time.

                                15.  SEVERABILITY

            Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:

      (a)   In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or portion 
thereof, shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, 
in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement and parts of 
such provision not so invalid or unenforceable shall be unaffected thereby 
and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by 
law.

      (b)   Any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, which may be 
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be limited by construction  
thereof, to the end that such provision, or portion thereof, shall be valid 
and enforceable in such jurisdiction; and

      (c)   Any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, which may 
for any reason be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall remain 
in  effect and be enforceable in any jurisdiction in which such provision, or 
portion thereof, shall be valid and enforceable.

                         16.  SUCCESSORS TO THE COMPANY

            Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of the 
Company, including, without limitation, any corporation or corporations 
acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the assets of 
the Company whether by merger, consolidation, sale or otherwise (and such 
successor shall thereafter be deemed "the Company" for the purposes of this 
Agreement), but shall not otherwise be assignable by the Company.

                             17.  CHANGE IN CONTROL

            For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control of 
the Company" shall mean a change in control of a nature that would be 
required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of 
Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as in 
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that, without limitation, such 
a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if and when (a) any 
"person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) is or becomes a beneficial owner, directly 
or indirectly, of securities 


                                     - 28 -
<PAGE>

of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the 
Company's then outstanding securities or (b) during any period of 24 
consecutive months, commencing before or after the date of this Agreement, 
individuals who at the beginning of such twenty-four (24) month period were 
directors of the Company for whom the Executive shall have voted cease for 
any reason (other than death, disability or retirement pursuant to the 
Company's policy relating to retirement of directors, if any, in effect on 
the date of this Agreement) to constitute at least a majority of the Board of 
Directors of the Company.

                 18.  INTENTION RELATING TO RECENT LEGISLATION;
                           POSSIBLE FUTURE AMENDMENTS

18.01       The Company and the Executive intend that this Agreement shall be
performed according to its terms hereinbefore set forth, and that such 
performance shall not give rise to or result in any payment or benefit being 
subject to the Excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or the related 
loss of deduction mandated by Section 280G(a) of the Code.  Each and every 
provision of this Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed 
to carry out such intention.

18.02       The Company and the Executive recognize that the legislation 
which introduced Sections 280G(a) and 4999 of the Code was enacted very  
recently and that there are as yet no regulations or rulings under, or 
official interpretations of, any of these Code Sections.  Accordingly, the 
Company and the Executive agree that, when Treasury Regulations are issued in 
proposed or final form under Section 280G or 4999 of the Code or relevant 
rulings or official interpretations are promulgated, they will at that time, 
or from time to time, review this Agreement and take such action, including 
executing amendments hereto, as the Company and the Executive may agree to be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the aforesaid intention.

              AGREEMENT between PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION, an Ohio 
Corporation (the Company), and _____________________ (the Executive), 
dated the ______ day of ___________, 1991.

                                W I T N E S S E T H :
              WHEREAS:

              A.     The Executive is a principal officer of the Company 
and an integral part of its management.

              B.     The Company wishes to assure both itself and the 
Executive of continuity of management in the event of any actual or 
threatened change in control of the Company

              C.     This agreement is not intended to alter materially 
the compensation and benefits that the Executive could reasonably expect 
in the absence of a change in control of the Company and, accordingly, 
this Agreement, though taking effect upon execution thereof, will be 
operative only upon a change in control of the Company, as that term is 
hereafter defined.

              NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the 
parties as follows:

     1.  OPERATION OF AGREEMENT

     This Agreement shall be effective immediately upon its execution by 
the parties hereto, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, neither this Agreement nor any provision thereof, 
except for this Section 1, Sections 14 through 17 inclusive, paragraph 
13.01, paragraphs 13.07 through 13.10 inclusive, and provisions of 


<PAGE>

subparagraphs 3.01 (a)(ii), 3.04(b) and 4.01(b) and of Section 12 
providing for automatic updating of Exhibits B, D, E and F from time to 
time prior to the date this Agreement becomes operative, shall be 
operative unless and until there has been a Change in Control of the 
Company as defined in Section 17 below while the Executive is in the 
employ of the Company.  Upon such a Change in Control of the Company, 
this Agreement and all provisions thereof shall become operative 
immediately.

     2.  EMPLOYMENT; PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT

     2.01  The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its 
employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the 
Company, for the period set forth in paragraph 2.02 below (the Period of 
Employment), in the position and with the duties and responsibilities 
set forth in Section 3 below, and upon the other terms and conditions 
hereinafter stated.

     2.02  The Period of Employment shall commence on the date this 
Agreement becomes operative pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 
above (the Operative Date) and, subject only to the provisions of 
Section 6 below, relating to death or Disability, shall continue until 
the close of business on the date stated in Exhibit A attached to and 
made part of this Agreement.  In the event that the Executive shall 
continue in the full-time employment of the Company after the latter 
date, such continued employment shall be subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement and the Period of Employment shall include 
the period during which the Executive in fact so continues in such 
employment.

                                 -2-
<PAGE>

     3.  POSITION, DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES

     3.01   (a)   (i)  It is contemplated that during the Period of 
Employment the Executive shall continue to serve as a principal officer 
of the Company and as a member of its Board of Directors if serving as a 
member of its Board of Directors immediately prior to the Operative 
Date, with the office(s) and title(s), reporting responsibility, and 
duties and responsibilities of the Executive immediately prior to the 
Operative Date.

                 (ii)  The office(s), title(s), reporting 
responsibility, duties and responsibilities of the Executive on the date 
of this Agreement, as the same may be changed from time to time prior to 
the Operative Date, shall be summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement 
to the end that, if this Agreement becomes operative pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 1 above, Exhibit B will reflect accurately the 
office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, duties and 
responsibilities of the Executive immediately prior to the Operative 
Date, it being understood and agreed that if, as and when the office(s), 
title(s), reporting responsibility, duties or responsibilities of the 
Executive shall be changed prior to the Operative Date, Exhibit B shall 
be deemed to be and shall be updated by the parties to reflect such 
change; provided, however, that Exhibit B is intended only as a 
memorandum for the convenience of the parties and shall be disregarded 
if and to the extent that, on the Operative Date, Exhibit B shall fail 
to reflect accurately the office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, 
duties or responsibilities of the Executive immediately prior to the 
Operative Date because the parties shall have failed to update Exhibit B 
as contemplated hereby.

            (b)  At all times during the Period of Employment, the 
Executive shall hold a position of responsibility and importance and a 
position of scope, with the functions, duties

                                 -3-
<PAGE>

and responsibilities attached thereto, at least equal in responsibility 
and importance and in scope to and commensurate with his position 
described in general terms in subparagraph 3.01(a) above and intended to 
be summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

     3.02  During the Period of Employment the Executive shall also 
serve and continue to serve, if and when elected and reelected, as an 
officer or director, or both, of any subsidiary, division or affiliate 
of the Company.

     3.03  Throughout the Period of Employment the Executive shall 
devote his full time and undivided attention during normal business 
hours to the business and affairs of the Company, except for reasonable 
vacations and except for illness or incapacity, but nothing in this 
Agreement shall preclude the Executive from devoting reasonable periods 
required for serving as a director or member of a committee of any 
organization involving no conflict of interest with the interests of the 
Company, from engaging in charitable and community activities, and from 
managing his personal investments, provided that such activities do not 
materially interfere with the regular performance of his duties and 
responsibilities under this Agreement.

     3.04   (a)  The office of the Executive shall be located at the 
principal offices of the Company within the area within which the office 
of the Executive is located immediately prior to the Operative Date, and 
the Executive shall not be required to locate his office elsewhere 
without his prior written consent, nor shall he be required to be absent 
therefrom on travel status or otherwise more than the total number of 
working days in any calendar 
                                 -4-
<PAGE>

year
stated in Exhibit C attached to and made part of this Agreement nor more 
than the number of consecutive days at any one time stated in such 
Exhibit C.

            (b)  The area within which the office of the Executive is 
located on the date of this Agreement, as the same may be changed from 
time to time prior to the Operative Date, shall be described in Exhibit 
D to this Agreement to the end that, if this Agreement becomes operative 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 above, Exhibit D will reflect 
accurately the area within which the office of the Executive was located 
immediately prior to the Operative Date, it being understood and agreed 
that if, as and when the area within which the office of the Executive 
is located shall be changed prior to the Operative Date, Exhibit D shall 
be deemed to be and shall be updated by the parties to reflect such 
change; provided, however, that Exhibit D is intended only as a 
memorandum for the convenience of the parties and shall be disregarded 
if and to the extent that, on the Operative Date, Exhibit D shall fail 
to reflect accurately the area within which the office of the Executive 
was located immediately prior to the Operative Date because the parties 
shall have failed to update Exhibit D as contemplated hereby.

     4.  COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION PLANS, PERQUISITES

     4.01   (a)  For all services rendered by the Executive in any 
capacity during the Period of Employment, including, without limitation, 
services as an executive, officer, director or member of any committee 
of the Company or of any subsidiary, division or affiliate thereof, the 
Executive shall be paid as compensation:

                  (i)  A base salary, payable not less often than 
monthly, at a monthly rate (before reduction for any deduction 
including, without limitation, any deduction for

                                 -5-
<PAGE>

withholding of income taxes or F.I.C.A. taxes and any deduction pursuant 
to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the 
"Code") at least equal to the monthly rate (before reduction for any 
such deduction) of salary which was payable to the Executive immediately 
prior to the Operative Date, with increases in such rate after the 
Operative Date in accordance with the Company's regular administrative 
practices, relating to salary increases applicable to executives of the 
Company, in effect immediately prior to the Operative Date (the Minimum 
Base Salary), and 

                 (ii)  An executive performance award or bonus under the 
Company's Executive Compensation Plan, or such equivalent successor plan 
as may be adopted by the Company, upon a basis that will render an 
executive performance award or bonus for each calendar month which is 
within the calendar year to which such executive performance award or 
bonus relates, and within the Period of Employment or within the 
calendar year in which the Period of Employment commences, equal to no 
less than the highest executive performance award or bonus awarded by 
the Company to the Executive (whether on a current or deferred payment 
basis) prior to the Operative Date, divided by twelve (the Minimum 
Monthly Bonus), so that total compensation for any such calendar month 
(the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation) shall consist of the Minimum 
Base Salary for such  month provided for in clause (i) if this 
subparagraph 4.01(a), plus the Minimum Monthly Bonus for such month 
provided for in clause (ii) of this subparagraph 4.01(a).

            (b)  The Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that is 
applicable from time to time after the date of this Agreement pursuant 
to the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a)

                                 -6-
<PAGE>

above, or that would be applicable if this Agreement were operative at 
such time, shall be set forth in Exhibit E to this Agreement, the intent 
of this subparagraph 4.01(b) being that such Exhibit E shall be deemed 
to be and shall be updated from time to time after the date of this 
Agreement, whether or not this Agreement shall then be operative, to 
reflect the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that applies at the time, 
or that would apply at the time if this Agreement were then operative, 
provided, however, that such Exhibit E is intended only as a memorandum 
for the convenience of the parties hereto and, in the event that there 
is at any time any conflict, disparity or discrepancy between the 
Minimum Total Monthly Compensation provided by subparagraph 4.01(a) 
above and the amount then set forth in Exhibit E hereto, the provisions 
of subparagraph 4.01(a) shall in all events control.

            (c)  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a) above 
relating to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation, nothing in this 
Agreement shall preclude a change in the mix between the Minimum Base 
Salary and Minimum Monthly Bonus of the Executive by increasing the 
Minimum Base Salary of the Executive.

            (d)  Any increase in salary pursuant to clause (i) of 
subparagraph 4.01(a) or in bonus or other compensation shall in no way 
diminish any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

     4.02   (a)  During the Period of Employment the Executive shall be 
and continue to be a full participant in the Company's Executive 
Compensation Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan, any Employees Stock 
Option Plan, including its 1977 Stock Option Plan and 1977 Stock 
Appreciation Rights Plan and 1982 Employees Stock Option Plan, or 
equivalent successor plans that may be adopted by the Company, with at 
least the same reward

                                 -7-
<PAGE>

opportunities as shall have been provided immediately prior to the 
Operative Date.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude improvement of 
reward opportunities in such plans or other plans in accordance with the 
practice of the Company immediately prior to the Operative Date.

            (b)  Any provision of the Company's Executive Compensation 
Plan (or any successor plan) to the contrary notwithstanding, any 
executive performance award or bonus awarded to the Executive during the 
Period of Employment (whether for services rendered during or prior to 
the Period of Employment) shall, unless the Executive shall have 
approved otherwise in writing, be paid wholly in cash as soon as 
practicable after the awards are made. 

     4.03  During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be 
entitled to perquisites, including, without limitation, an office, 
secretarial and clerical staff, and to fringe benefits, including, 
without limitation, the business and personal use of an automobile and 
payment or reimbursement of club dues, in each case at least equal to 
those attached to his office immediately prior to the Operative Date, as 
well as to reimbursement, upon proper accounting, of reasonable expenses 
and disbursements incurred by him in the course of his duties.

     5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     5.01  The compensation provided for in Section 4 above, together 
with other matters therein set forth, is in addition to the benefits 
provided for in this Section 5.

                                 -8-
<PAGE>

     5.02  In the event that the Executive shall not have been 
designated a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program of the Company prior to the Operative Date, the 
Executive shall be and hereby is designated, on and as of the Operative
Date, a Participant in that Program as in effect immediately prior to 
the Operative Date.

     5.03  The Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall be 
entitled to all payments and benefits and service credit for benefits 
during the Period of Employment to which officers of the Company, their 
dependents and beneficiaries are entitled as the result of the 
employment of such officers during the Period of Employment under the 
terms of employee plans and practices of the Company, including, without 
limitation, the Company's retirement program (consisting of its 
Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, its Excess Benefits Plan, if 
any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Program) the 
Company's stock purchase and savings, thrift and investment plans, if 
any, its Group Life Insurance Plan, its accidental death and 
dismemberment insurance, disability, medical, dental and health and 
welfare plans and other present or equivalent successor plans and 
practices of the Company, its subsidiaries and divisions, for which 
officers, their dependents and beneficiaries are eligible, and to all 
payments or other benefits under any such plan or practice after the 
Period of Employment as a result of participation in such plan or 
practice during the Period of Employment.

     5.04  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from 
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or practice, but, it 
being the intent of the parties that the Executive shall continue to be 
entitled during the Period of Employment to perquisites

                                 -9-
<PAGE>

as set forth in paragraph 4.03 above and to benefits and service credit 
for benefits under paragraph 5.03 above at least equal to those attached 
to his position immediately prior to the Operative Date, nothing in this 
Agreement shall operate as, or be construed to reduce or authorize, a 
reduction without the Executive's written consent in the level of such 
perquisites, benefits or service credit for benefits; in the event of 
any such reduction, by amendment or termination of any plan or practice 
or otherwise, the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall 
continue to be entitled to perquisites, benefits and service credit for 
benefits at least equal to the perquisites and to benefits and service 
credit for benefits under such plans or practices that he or his 
dependents and beneficiaries would have received if such reduction had 
not taken place.

     6.  EFFECT OF DEATH OR DISABILITY

     6.01  In the event of the death of the Executive during the Period 
of Employment, the legal representative of the Executive shall be 
entitled to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the month in 
which death shall have occurred, and the Period of Employment shall be 
deemed to have ended as of the close of business on the last day of such 
month but without prejudice to any payments due in respect of the 
Executive's death.

     6.02   (a)  The term "Disability", as used in this Agreement, shall 
mean an illness or accident which prevents the Executive from performing 
his duties under this Agreement for a period of six consecutive months.  
The Period of Employment shall be deemed to have ended as of the close 
of business on the last day of such six month period but without 
prejudice to any payments due the Executive in respect of disability.

                                 -10-
<PAGE>

            (b)  In the event of the Disability of the Executive during 
the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be paid an amount, equal 
to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the month in which such 
Disability commenced, at the end of each month during the period of such 
Disability but not in excess of six months.

            (c)  The amount of any payments due under this paragraph 
6.02 shall be reduced by any payments to which the Executive may be 
entitled for the same period because of disability under any disability 
or pension plan of the Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate 
thereof.

     7.  TERMINATION

     7.01  In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 
below, during the Period of Employment, the provisions of this Section 7 
shall apply.

     7.02  In the event of a Termination and subject to compliance by 
the Executive with the provisions of paragraph 7.04 below, relating to 
Competition, and of Section 9 below, relating to confidential 
information, the Company shall, as liquidated damages, pay to the 
Executive and provide him, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate with 
the following:

            (a)  The Company shall pay the Executive an amount equal to 
the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that would have been paid to the 
Executive for the month in which Termination occurred had such 
Termination not occurred,

                  (i)  at the end of the month in which Termination 
occurred, and

                 (ii)  at the end of each month thereafter during the 
remainder of the Period of Employment, provided, however, that in no 
event shall the Company be required

                                 -11-
<PAGE>

to pay such an amount after the month in which the death of the 
Executive shall have occurred or after the twelfth month following the 
occurrence of an illness or accident which would constitute a 
"Disability" under subparagraph 6.02(b) above in the absence of such 
Termination.

            (b)  During the period that the payments provided for in 
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made, the 
Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate, shall continue to 
be entitled to all benefits and service credit for benefits under 
employee benefit plans of the Company as if still employed during such 
period under this Agreement and, if and to the extent that such benefits 
or service credit for benefits shall not be payable or provided under 
any such plans to the Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and 
estate, by reason of his no longer being an employee of the Company as 
the result of Termination, the Company shall itself pay or provide for 
payment of such benefits and service credit for benefits to the 
Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate.

            (c)  The period in which the payments provided for in 
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made shall be 
considered service with the Company for the purpose (i) of continued 
credits under the Company's retirement program (consisting of its 
Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, its Excess Benefits Plan, if 
any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Program) as each 
such plan or program was in effect immediately prior to Termination (but 
without giving effect to any reduction of benefits thereunder as the 
result of amendment or termination of any such Plan or Program during 
the Period of Employment) and (ii) of all other benefit plans of the 
Company as in effect immediately prior to Termination.


                                 -12-
<PAGE>

            (d)  In the event that the Executive shall at the time of 
Termination hold an outstanding and unexercised (whether or not 
exercisable at the time) non-statutory stock option or options 
theretofore granted by the Company, the Company shall, in addition to 
the amounts provided for in subparagraphs 7.02(a) and 7.02(b), pay to 
the Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to the excess above the 
option price under each such non-statutory stock option of the Fair 
Market Value at the time of Termination of the shares subject to each 
such non-statutory stock option.  Solely for the purpose of this 
subparagraph (d), Fair Market Value at the time of Termination shall be 
deemed to mean the higher of (i) the average of the reported closing 
prices of the Common Shares of the Company, as reported on the New York 
Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions, on the last trading day prior to 
the Termination and on the last trading day of each of the two preceding 
thirty day periods, and (ii) in the event that a Change in Control, as 
defined in Section 17 below, prior to Termination shall have taken place 
as the result of a tender or exchange offer and such Change in Control 
was consummated within twelve months of Termination, the highest 
consideration paid for Common Shares of the Company in the course of 
such tender or exchange offer.  Upon receiving the payment from the 
Company called for by clause (i) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 
7.02, the Executive shall execute and deliver to the Company a general 
release in favor of the Company, its successors and assigns, in respect 
of any and all matters, including, without limitation, any and all 
rights under any outstanding and unexercisable non-statutory stock 
options at the time of Termination, except for the payments and 
obligations required to be made or assumed by the Company under this 
Agreement which at the time had not yet been made or assumed by the 
Company and except for such other valid obligations of the Company as 
shall be set forth in such release.

                                 -13-
<PAGE>

            (e)  If as a result of a termination of employment pursuant 
to the provisions of paragraph 7.03(b) the Executive (or anyone claiming 
under or through him) loses any part or all of the benefits he would 
have received as a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the 
Operative Date, the Company will provide him with a substantially 
equivalent benefit.

     7.03  The word "Termination", for the purpose of this Section 7 and 
any other provision of this Agreement, shall mean:

            (a)  Termination by the Company of the employment of the 
Executive by the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason other than 
for Cause as defined in paragraph 7.05 below or for Disability as defined 
in subparagraph 6.02(a) above; or

            (b)  Termination by the Executive of his employment by the 
Company and its subsidiaries upon the occurrence of any of the following 
events:

                  (i)  Failure to elect or reelect the Executive to the 
Board of Directors of the Company, if the Executive shall have been a 
member of the Board of Directors immediately prior to the Operative 
Date, or failure to elect or reelect the Executive to, or removal of the 
Executive from, any of the office(s) described in paragraph 3.01(a)(i) 
above and intended to be summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

                 (ii)  A significant change in the nature or scope of 
the authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to the position 
described in paragraph 3.01(a)(i) above and intended to be summarized in 
Exhibit B to this Agreement, or a reduction in compensation, which is 
not remedied within 30 days after receipt by the Company of written 
notice from the Executive.

                                 -14-
<PAGE>

                (iii)  A determination by the Executive made in good 
faith that as a result of a Change in Control of the Company, as defined 
in Section 17 below, and a change in circumstances on or after the 
Operative Date significantly affecting his position, he is unable to 
carry out the authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to his 
position and contemplated by Section 3 of this Agreement and the 
situation is not remedied within 30 days after receipt by the Company of 
written notice from the Executive of such determination.

                 (iv)  A breach by the Company of any provision of this 
Agreement not embraced within the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) 
of this subparagraph 7.03(b) which is not remedied within 30 days after 
receipt by the Company of written notice from the Executive.

                  (v)  The liquidation, dissolution, consolidation or 
merger of the Company or transfer of all or a significant portion of its 
assets unless a successor or successors (by merger, consolidation or 
otherwise) to which all or a significant portion of its assets have been 
transferred shall have assumed all duties and obligations of the Company 
under this Agreement; provided that in any event set forth in this 
subparagraph 7.03(b) above, the Executive shall have elected to 
terminate his employment under this Agreement upon not less than forty 
and not more than ninety days' advance written notice to the Board of 
Directors of the Company, Attention of the Secretary, given, except in 
the case of a continuing breach, within three calendar months after (A) 
failure to be so elected or reelected, or removal, (B) expiration of the 
thirty-day cure period with respect to such event, or (C) the closing 
date of such


                                 -15-
<PAGE>

liquidation, dissolution, consolidation, merger or transfer of assets, 
as the case may be.  An election by the Executive to terminate his 
employment given under the provisions of this paragraph 7.03 shall not 
be deemed a voluntary termination of employment by the Executive for the 
purpose of this Agreement or any plan or practice of the Company.

     7.04   (a)  There shall be no obligation on the part of the Company 
to make any further payments provided for in paragraph 7.02 above or to 
provide any further benefits specified in such paragraph 7.02 if the 
Executive shall, during the period that such payments are being made or 
benefits provided, engage in Competition with the Company as hereinafter 
defined, provided all of the following shall have taken place:

                  (i)  the Secretary of the Company, pursuant to 
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, shall have given 
written notice to the Executive that, in the opinion of the Board of 
Directors, the Executive is engaged in such Competition, specifying the 
details;

                 (ii)  the Executive shall have been given a reasonable 
opportunity to appear before the Board of Directors prior to the 
determination of the Board evidenced by such resolution; and

                (iii)  the Executive shall neither have ceased to engage 
in such Competition within thirty days from his receipt of such notice 
nor diligently taken all reasonable steps to that end during such 
thirty-day period and thereafter.

            (b)  The word "Competition" for purposes of this paragraph 
7.04 and any other

                                 -16-
<PAGE>

provision of this Agreement shall mean taking a management position 
with, or control of, a business engaged in the manufacture, processing, 
purchase of distribution of products which constituted 15% or more of 
the sales of the Company and its subsidiaries and divisions during the 
last fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of the 
Executive's employment (or during any fiscal year of the Company during 
the Period of Employment); provided, however, that in no event shall 
ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock entitled to 
vote for the election of directors of a corporation with a class of 
equity securities held of record by more than 500 persons, standing 
alone, be deemed Competition with the Company within the meaning of this 
paragraph 7.04.

     7.05  For the purpose of any provision of this Agreement, the 
termination of the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been 
for Cause only:

            (a)  if termination of his employment shall have been the 
result of an act or acts of dishonesty on the part of the Executive 
constituting a felony and resulting or intended to result directly or 
indirectly in gain or personal enrichment at the expense of the Company, 
or
            (b)  if there has been a breach by the Executive during the 
Period of Employment of the provisions of paragraph 3.03 above, relating 
to the time to be devoted to the affairs of the Company, or of Section 
9, relating to confidential information, and such breach results in 
demonstrably material injury to the Company, and with respect to any 
alleged breach of paragraph 3.03 hereof, the Executive shall have both 
failed to remedy such alleged breach within thirty days from his receipt 
of written notice by the Secretary of the Company pursuant to resolution 
duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company after notice

                                 -17-
<PAGE>

to the Executive and an opportunity to be heard demanding that he remedy 
such alleged breach, and failed to take all reasonable steps to that end 
during such thirty-day period and thereafter; provided that there shall 
have been delivered to the Executive a certified copy of a resolution of 
the Board of Directors of the Company adopted by the affirmative vote of 
not less than three-fourths of the entire membership of the Board of 
Directors called and held for that purpose and at which the Executive 
was given an opportunity to be heard, finding that the Executive was 
guilty of conduct set forth in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above, 
specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

     Anything in this paragraph 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement to 
the contrary notwithstanding, the employment of the Executive shall in 
no event be considered to have been terminated by the Company for Cause 
if termination of his employment took place (i) as the result of bad 
judgment or negligence on the part of the Executive, or (ii) as the 
result of an act or omission without intent of gaining therefrom 
directly or indirectly a profit to which the Executive was not legally 
entitled, or (iii) because of an act or omission believed by the 
Executive in good faith to have been in or not opposed to the interests 
of the Company, or (iv) for any act or omission in respect of which a 
determination could properly be made that the Executive met the 
applicable standard of conduct prescribed for indemnification or 
reimbursement or payment of expenses under the Code of Regulations of 
the Company or the laws of the State of Ohio or the directors' and 
officers' liability insurance of the Company, in each case as in effect 
at the time of such act or omission, or (v) as the result of an act or 
omission which occurred more than twelve calendar months prior to the 
Executive's having been given notice of the termination of his 
employment for such act or omission unless the commission of such act or 
such omission could not at the

                                 -18-
<PAGE>

time of such commission or omission have been known to a member of the 
Board of Directors of the Company (other than the Executive, if he is 
then a member of the Board of Directors), in which case more than twelve 
calendar months from the date that the commission of such act or such 
omission was or could reasonably have been so known, or (vi) as the 
result of a continuing course of action which commenced and was or could 
reasonably have been known to a member of the Board of Directors of the 
Company (other than the Executive) more than twelve calendar months 
prior to notice having been given to the Executive of the termination of 
his employment.

     7.06  In the event that the Executive's employment shall be 
terminated by the Company during the Period of Employment and such 
termination is alleged to be for Cause, or the Executive's right to 
terminate his employment under paragraph 7.03(b) above shall be 
questioned by the Company, or the Company shall withhold payments or 
provision of benefits because the Executive is alleged to be engaged in 
Competition in breach of the provisions of paragraph 7.04 above or for 
any other reason, the Executive shall have the right, in addition to all 
other rights and remedies provided by law, at his election either to 
seek arbitration within the area within which the office of the 
Executive was located immediately prior to the Operative Date and 
intended to be described in Exhibit D to this Agreement under the rules 
of the American Arbitration Association by serving a notice to arbitrate 
upon the Company or to institute a judicial proceeding, in either case 
within ninety days after having received notice of termination of his 
employment or notice in any form that the termination of his employment 
under paragraph 7.03(b) is subject to question or that the Company is 
withholding or proposed to withhold payments or provision of benefits

                                 -19-
<PAGE>

or within such longer period as may reasonably be necessary for the 
Executive to take action in the event that his illness or incapacity 
should preclude his taking such action within such ninety-day period.

     7.07  Any provision above in this Section 7 to the contrary 
notwithstanding, if the Company should default on any obligation set 
forth in this Section 7 and shall have failed to remedy such default 
within thirty (30) days after having received written notice of such 
default from the Executive or his beneficiaries, then, in that event: 

            (a)  any and all undischarged, future obligations of the 
Company under this Section 7 shall, at the sole option of the Executive 
or his beneficiaries, exercised in writing signed by the Executive or 
his beneficiaries, as the case may be, and delivered to the Company 
within ninety (90) days after the expiration of such thirty-day period, 
become immediately due and payable in a lump sum discounted to present 
value using the "Federal short-term rate," "Federal mid-term rate" or 
"Federal long-term rate" that would apply at the time under section 
1274(d) of the Code to a debt instrument having a term equal to the 
period extending from the date such option is exercised in writing to 
the date or dates such future obligations of the Company would otherwise 
have become due and payable; and

            (b)  in addition to, and not in substitution for, interest 
for any other period properly payable to the Executive as a result of 
such default, the Company agrees to pay pre-judgment interest on any 
such obligation in default, calculated at the "Federal short-term rate," 
"Federal mid-term rate" or "Federal long-term rate" that would apply at 
the time under section 1274(d) of the Code to a debt instrument having a 
term equal to the period extending from the date that the Company's 
obligation became due and payable hereunder

                                 -20-
<PAGE>

to the date the Executive or his beneficiaries obtain a money judgment 
therefor (whether in litigation or arbitration).

     8.  [INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

     9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

     9.01  The Executive agrees not to disclose, either while in the 
Company's employ or at any time thereafter, to any person not employed 
by the Company, or not engaged to render services to the Company, any 
confidential information obtained by him while in the employ of the 
Company, including, without limitation, any of the Company's inventions, 
processes, methods of distribution, customers or trade secrets; 
provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude the Executive 
from use or disclosure of information known generally to the public or 
of information not considered confidential by persons engaged in the 
business conducted by the Company or from disclosure required by law or 
Court order.

     9.02  The Executive also agrees that upon leaving the Company's 
employ, he will not take with him, without the prior written consent of 
an officer authorized to act in the matter by the Board of Directors of 
the Company, any drawing, blueprint, specification or other document of 
the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, which is of a 
confidential nature relating to the Company, its subsidiaries, 
affiliates and divisions, or without limitation, relating to its or 
their methods of distribution, or any description of any formulae or 
secret processes.

<PAGE>

    10.  SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE

     In the event that, following the date stated in Exhibit A attached 
to and made part of this Agreement, the employment of the Executive 
shall be terminated by the Company prior to his normal retirement date 
and such termination shall be for any reason other than for Cause, as 
defined in paragraph 7.05 above, the Company shall pay the Executive as 
a severance allowance a lump sum equal to the Minimum Total Monthly 
Compensation for the month prior to such termination of employment, 
multiplied by six.

    11.  WITHHOLDING

     Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to 
be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive or his estate or 
beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if

    13.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

    13.01  This Agreement is not intended to and shall not infer or 
imply any right on the part of the Executive to continue in the employ 
of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, prior to

in Control of the 


                                 -23-
<PAGE>

Company.  Nor is this Agreement intended to nor shall it infer or 
imply any obligation on the part of the Executive to continue in the 
employment of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the 
Company, prior to a Change in Control of the Company. Neither the 
Company nor the Executive shall incur any liability under this Agreement 
if the employment of the Executive shall be terminated by the Company or 
by the Executive prior to a Change in Control of the Company.

Agreement. 

    13.03  The Company and the Executive recognize that each party will

preclude the legal representative of his estate from assigning any right 
hereunder to the person or persons entitled thereto under his will or, 
in the case of intestacy, to the person or persons entitled thereto 
under the laws of intestacy applicable to his estate.  The term 
"beneficiaries" as used in this Agreement shall mean a beneficiary or 
beneficiaries so designated to receive any such amount or, if no 
beneficiary has been so designated, the legal representative of the

anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, 
hypothecation, or set-off in respect of any claim, debt or obligation,

                                 -24-
<PAGE>

Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his legal 
representative or, where appropriate, to his beneficiary or 
beneficiaries.

take place on a legal holiday, such event shall take place on the next 
succeeding day that is not a legal holiday.

    13.08  The titles to sections in this Agreement are intended solely 
for convenience and no provision of this Agreement is to be construed by 
reference to the title of any section.

    13.09  This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the 
benefit of the Executive, his heirs and legal representatives, and the 
Company and its successors as provided in Section 16 hereof.

    13.10  This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties 
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes and 
replaces all prior agreements and understandings with respect to such 
subject matter, and the parties hereto have made no agreements, 
representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this 
Agreement which are not set forth herein.

    14.  AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION; WAIVER

to in writing, signed by the Executive and by an officer of the Company 
thereunto duly authorized.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in 
this Agreement, no waiver by either party hereto of any breach by the 
other party hereto of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be 
performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent 
breach of such condition or provision or a waiver of a similar or 
dissimilar provision or condition at the same or at any prior or 
subsequent time.

    15.  SEVERABILITY

     Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:

            (a)  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or 
portion thereof, shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for 
any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this 
Agreement and parts of such provision not so invalid or unenforceable 
shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to 
the fullest extent permitted by law.

            (b)  Any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, 
which may be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be 
limited by construction thereof, to the end that such provision, or 
portion thereof, shall be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction; 
and

            (c)  Any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, 
which may for any reason be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction 
shall remain in effect and be enforceable in any jurisdiction in which 
such provision, or portion thereof, shall be valid and enforceable.

    16.  SUCCESSORS TO THE COMPANY

     Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor 
of the Company, including, without limitation, any corporation or 
corporations acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all 
of the assets of the Company whether by merger, consolidation, sale or 
otherwise (and such successor shall thereafter be deemed "the Company" 
for the purposes of this Agreement), but shall not otherwise be 
assignable by the Company.

    17.  CHANGE IN CONTROL

     For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control of 
the Company" shall mean a change in control of a nature that would be 
required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of 
Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as 
in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that, without 
limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if 
and when (a) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) is or becomes a 
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company 
representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's 
then outstanding securities or (b) during any period of 24 consecutive 
months, commencing before or after the date of this Agreement, 
individuals who at the beginning of such twenty-four month period were 
directors of the Company for whom the Executive shall have voted cease 
for any reason (other than death, disability or retirement pursuant to 
the Company's policy relating to retirement of directors, if any, in 
effect on the date of this Agreement) to constitute at least a majority 
of the Board of Directors of the Company.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement 
as the day and year first above written.

            AGREEMENT between PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION, an Ohio
Corporation (the Company), and ___________________ (the Executive), 
dated the ____ day of _____________, 1994.
                              W I T N E S S E T H :
            WHEREAS:

            A.    The Executive is a principal officer of the Company 
and an integral part of its management.

            B.    The Company wishes to assure both itself and the 
Executive of continuity of management in the event of any actual or 
threatened change in control of the Company.

            C.    This agreement is not intended to alter materially the 
compensation and benefits that the Executive could reasonably expect in 
the absence of a change in control of the Company and, accordingly, this 
Agreement, though taking effect upon execution thereof, will be 
operative only upon a change in control of the Company, as that term is 
hereafter defined.

            NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the 
parties as follows:

     1.  OPERATION OF AGREEMENT

     This Agreement shall be effective immediately upon its execution by 
the parties hereto, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, neither this Agreement nor any provision thereof, 
except for this Section 1, Sections 14 through 18

<PAGE>

inclusive, paragraph 13.01, paragraphs 13.07 through 13.10 inclusive, 
and provisions of subparagraphs 3.01 (a)(ii), 3.04(b) and 4.01(b) and of 
Section 12 providing for automatic updating of Exhibits B, D, E and F 
from time to time prior to the date this Agreement becomes operative, 
shall be operative unless and until there has been a Change in Control 
of the Company as defined in Section 17 below while the Executive is in 
the employ of the Company.  Upon such a Change in Control of the 
Company, this Agreement and all provisions thereof shall become 
operative immediately.

     2.  EMPLOYMENT, PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT

     2.01  The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its 
employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the 
Company, for the period set forth in paragraph 2.02 below (the Period of 
Employment), in the position and with the duties and responsibilities 
set forth in Section 3 below, and upon the other terms and conditions 
hereinafter stated.

     2.02  The Period of Employment shall commence on the date this 
Agreement becomes operative pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 
above (the Operative Date) and, subject only to the provisions of
Section 6 below, relating to death or Disability, shall continue until 
the close of business on the date stated in Exhibit A attached to and 
made part of this Agreement.  In the event that the Executive shall 
continue in the full-time employment of the Company after the latter 
date, such continued employment shall be subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement and the Period of Employment shall

                                 -2-
<PAGE>

include the period during which the Executive in fact so continues in 
such employment.

     3.  POSITION, DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES

     3.01   (a)   (i)  It is contemplated that during the Period of 
Employment the Executive shall continue to serve as a principal officer 
of the Company and as a member of its Board of Directors if serving as a
member of its Board of Directors immediately prior to the Operative 
Date, with the office(s) and title(s), reporting responsibility, and 
duties and responsibilities of the Executive immediately prior to the 
Operative Date.

                 (ii)  The office(s), title(s), reporting 
responsibility, duties and responsibilities of the Executive on the date 
of this Agreement, as the same may be changed from time to time prior to 
the Operative Date, shall be summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement 
to the end that, if this Agreement becomes operative pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 1 above, Exhibit B will reflect accurately the 
office(s), title(s), reporting responsibility, duties and 
responsibilities of the Executive shall be changed prior to the 
Operative Date, Exhibit B shall be deemed to be and shall be updated by 
the parties to reflect such change; provided, however, that Exhibit B is 
intended only as a memorandum for the convenience of the parties and 
shall be disregarded if and to the extent that, on the Operative Date, 
Exhibit B shall fail to reflect accurately the office(s), title(s), 
reporting responsibility, duties or responsibilities of the Executive 
immediately prior to the Operative Date because the parties shall have 
failed to update Exhibit B as contemplated hereby.

            (b)  At all times during the Period of Employment, the 
Executive shall hold a position of responsibility and importance and a 
position of scope, with the functions, duties

                                 -3-
<PAGE>

and responsibilities attached thereto, at least equal in responsibility 
and importance and in scope to and commensurate with his position 
described in general terms in subparagraph 3.01(a) above and intended to 
be summarized in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

     3.02  During the Period of Employment the Executive shall also 
serve and continue to serve, if and when elected and reelected, as an 
officer or director, or both, of any subsidiary, division or affiliate 
of the Company.

     3.03  Throughout the Period of Employment the Executive shall 
devote his full time and undivided attention during normal business 
hours to the business and affairs of the Company, except for reasonable 
vacations and except for illness or incapacity, but nothing in this 
Agreement shall preclude the Executive from devoting reasonable periods 
required for serving as a director or member of a committee of any 
organization involving no conflict of interest with the interests of the 
Company, from engaging in charitable and community activities, and from 
managing his personal investments, provided that such activities do not 
materially interfere with the regular performance of his duties and 
responsibilities under this Agreement.

     3.04   (a)  The office of the Executive shall be located at the 
principal offices of the Company within the area within which the office 
of the Executive is located immediately prior to the Operative Date, and 
the Executive shall not be required to locate his office elsewhere 
without his prior written consent, nor shall he be required to be absent 
therefrom on travel status or otherwise more than the total number of 
working days in any calendar 

                                 -4-
<PAGE>

year stated in Exhibit C attached to and made part of this 
Agreement nor more than the number of consecutive days at any one time 
stated in such Exhibit C.

            (b)   The area within which the office of the Executive is 
located on the date of this Agreement, as the same may be changed from 
time to time prior to the Operative Date, shall be described in Exhibit 
D to this Agreement to the end that, if this Agreement becomes operative 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 above, Exhibit D will reflect 
accurately the area within which the office of the Executive was located 
immediately prior to the Operative Date, it being understood and agreed 
that if, as and when the area within which the office of the Executive 
is located shall be changed prior to the Operative Date, Exhibit D shall 
be deemed to be and shall be updated by the parties to reflect such 
change; provided, however, that Exhibit D is intended only as a 
memorandum for the convenience of the parties and shall be disregarded 
if and to the extent that, on the Operative Date, Exhibit D shall fail 
to reflect accurately the area within which the office of the Executive 
was located immediately prior to the Operative Date because the parties 
shall have failed to update Exhibit D as contemplated hereby.

     4.  COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION PLANS, PERQUISITES

     4.01   (a)  For all services rendered by the Executive in any 
capacity during the Period of Employment, including, without limitation, 
services as an executive, officer, director or member of any committee 
of the Company or of any subsidiary, division or affiliate thereof, the 
Executive shall be paid as compensation:

                  (i)   A base salary, payable not less often than 
monthly, at a monthly rate (before reduction for any deduction 
including, without limitation, any deduction for

                                 -5-
<PAGE>

withholding of income taxes or F.I.C.A. taxes and any deduction pursuant 
to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
"Code")) at least equal to the monthly rate (before reduction for any 
such deduction) of salary which was payable to the Executive immediately 
prior to the Operative Date, with increases in such rate after the 
Operative Date in accordance with the Company's regular administrative 
practices, relating to salary increases applicable to executives of the 
Company, in effect immediately prior to the Operative Date (the Minimum 
Base Salary), and

                 (ii)  An executive performance award or bonus under the 
Company's Executive Compensation Plan, or such equivalent successor plan 
as may be adopted by the Company, upon a basis that will render an 
executive performance award or bonus for each calendar month which is 
within the calendar year to which such executive performance award or 
bonus relates, and within the Period of Employment or within the 
calendar year in which the Period of Employment commences, equal to no 
less than the highest executive performance award or bonus awarded by 
the Company to the Executive (whether on a current or deferred payment 
basis) prior to the Operative Date, divided by twelve (the Minimum 
Monthly Bonus), so that total compensation for any such calendar month 
(the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation) shall consist of the Minimum 
Base Salary for such month provided for in clause (i) if this 
subparagraph 4.01(a), plus the Minimum Monthly Bonus for such month 
provided for in clause (ii) of this subparagraph 4.01(a)

            (b)   The Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that is 
applicable from time to time after the date of this Agreement pursuant 
to the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a) 


                                 -6-
<PAGE>

above, or that would be applicable if this Agreement were operative at 
such time, shall be set forth in Exhibit E to this Agreement, the intent 
of this subparagraph 4.01(b) being that such Exhibit E shall be deemed to 
be and shall be updated from time to time after the date of this Agreement, 
whether or not this Agreement shall then be operative, to reflect the 
Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that applies at the time, or that would 
apply at the time if this Agreement were then operative, provided, however, 
that such Exhibit E is intended only as a memorandum for the convenience of 
the parties hereto and, in the event that there is at any time any 
conflict, disparity or discrepancy between the Minimum Total Monthly 
Compensation provided by subparagraph 4.01(a) above and the amount then set 
forth in Exhibit E hereto, the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a) shall in 
all events control.

            (c)  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 4.01(a) above 
relating to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation, nothing in this 
Agreement shall preclude a change in the mix between the Minimum Base 
Salary and Minimum Monthly Bonus of the Executive by increasing the 
Minimum Base Salary of the Executive. 

            (d)  Any increase in salary pursuant to clause (i) of 
subparagraph 4.01(a) or in bonus or other compensation shall in no way 
diminish any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

     4.02   (a)  During the Period of Employment the Executive shall be 
and continue to be a full participant in the Company's annual executive 
compensation plan, return on net assets bonus plan, any other annual 
cash incentive bonus plan, deferred compensation plan, Long-Term 
Incentive Plan, any Employees Stock Option Plan, including its 1982 
Employees Stock Option Plan, 1987 Employees Stock Option Plan, 1990 
Employees Stock Option Plan and

                                 -7-
<PAGE>

1993 Stock Incentive Program, or equivalent successor plans that may be 
adopted by the Company, with at least the same reward opportunities as 
shall have been provided immediately prior to the Operative Date.  
Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude improvement of reward 
opportunities in such plans or other plans in accordance with the 
practice of the Company immediately prior to the Operative Date.

            (b)  Any provision of the Company's Executive Compensation 
Plan (or any successor plan) to the contrary notwithstanding, any 
executive performance award or bonus awarded to the Executive during the 
Period of Employment (whether for services rendered during or prior to 
the Period of Employment) shall, unless the Executive shall have 
approved otherwise in writing, be paid wholly in cash as soon as 
practicable after the awards are made.

     4.03  During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be 
entitled to perquisites, including, without limitation, an office, 
secretarial and clerical staff, and to fringe benefits, including, 
without limitation, the business and personal use of an automobile and 
payment or reimbursement of club dues, in each case at least equal to 
those attached to his office immediately prior to the Operative Date, as 
well as to reimbursement, upon proper accounting, of reasonable expenses 
and disbursements incurred by him in the course of his duties.

     5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     5.01  The compensation provided for in Section 4 above, together 
with other matters therein set forth, is in addition to the benefits 
provided for in this Section 5.

                                 -8-
<PAGE>

     5.02  In the event that the Executive shall not have been 
designated a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program of the Company prior to the Operative Date, the 
Executive shall be and hereby is designated, on and as of the Operative 
Date, a Participant in that Program as in effect immediately prior to 
the Operative Date.

     5.03  The Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall be 
entitled to all payments and benefits and service credit for benefits 
during the Period of Employment to which officers of the Company, their 
dependents and beneficiaries are entitled as the result of the 
employment of such officers during the Period of Employment under the 
terms of employee plans and practices of the Company, including, without 
limitation, the Company's retirement program (consisting of the Parker-
Hannifin Corporation Retirement Plan, any excess benefits plan, or other 
program designed to restore benefits unavailable under tax-qualified 
plans of the Company solely by application of the requirements of the 
Code, if any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Program 
if applicable, and any other applicable plan of deferred compensation), 
the Parker-Hannifin Employees' Savings Plus Stock Ownership Plan, other 
Company stock purchase and savings, thrift and investment plans or 
programs, if any, the Benefits Plus Plan (including the group life 
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability, 
medical, dental and health and welfare plans) and other present or 
equivalent successor plans and practices of the Company, its 
subsidiaries and divisions, for which officers, their dependents and 
beneficiaries are eligible, and to all payments or other benefits under 
any such plan or practice after the Period of Employment as a result of
participation in such plan or practice during the Period of Employment.

                                 -9-
<PAGE>

     5.04  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from 
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or practice, but, it 
being the intent of the parties that the Executive shall continue to be 
entitled during the Period of Employment to perquisites as set forth in 
paragraph 4.03 above and to benefits and service credit for benefits 
under paragraph 5.03 above at least equal to those attached to his 
position immediately prior to the Operative Date, nothing in this 
Agreement shall operate as, or be construed to reduce or authorize, a 
reduction without the Executive's written consent in the level of such 
perquisites, benefits or service credit for benefits; in the event of 
any such reduction, by amendment or termination of any plan or practice 
or otherwise, the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries shall 
continue to be entitled to perquisites, benefits and service credit for 
benefits at least equal to the perquisites and to benefits and service 
credit for benefits under such plans or practices that he or his 
dependents and beneficiaries would have received if such reduction had 
not taken place.

     6.  EFFECT OF DEATH OR DISABILITY

     6.01  In the event of the death of the Executive during the Period 
of Employment, the legal representative of the Executive shall be 
entitled to the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the month in 
which death shall have occurred, and the Period of Employment shall be 
deemed to have ended as of the close of business on the last day of such 
month but without prejudice to any payments due in respect of the 
Executive's death.

     6.02   (a)  The term "Disability", as used in this Agreement, shall 
mean an illness or accident which prevents the Executive from performing 
his duties under this Agreement for

                                 -10-
<PAGE>

a period of six (6) consecutive months.  The Period of Employment shall 
be deemed to have ended as of the close of business on the last day of 
such six (6) month period but without prejudice to any payments due the 
Executive in respect of disability.

            (b)  In the event of the Disability of the Executive during 
the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be paid an amount equal to 
the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation for the month in which such 
Disability commenced.  Such amount shall be paid at the end of each 
month during the period of such Disability but not in excess of six (6) 
months.

            (c)  The amount of any payments due under this paragraph 
6.02 shall be reduced by any payments to which the Executive may be 
entitled for the same period because of disability under any disability 
or pension plan of the Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate 
thereof.

     7.  TERMINATION

     7.01  In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 
below, during the Period of Employment, the provisions of this Section 7 
shall apply.

     7.02  In the event of a Termination and subject to the provisions 
of Section 8 of this Agreement relating to mitigation of damages and to 
compliance by the Executive with the provisions of paragraph 7.04 below 
relating to Competition and of Section 9 below relating to confidential 
information, the Company shall, as liquidated damages or severance pay 
or both, pay to the Executive and provide him, his dependents, 
beneficiaries and estate with the following:

                                 -11-
<PAGE>

            (a)  The Company shall pay the Executive an amount equal to 
the Minimum Total Monthly Compensation that would have been paid to the 
Executive for the month in which Termination occurred had such 
Termination not occurred, 

                  (i)  at the end of the month in which Termination 
occurred, and

                 (ii)  at the end of each month thereafter during the 
remainder of the Period of Employment, provided, however, that in no 
event shall the Company be required to pay such an amount after the 
month in which the death of the Executive shall have occurred or after 
the twelfth month following the occurrence of an illness or accident 
which would constitute a "Disability" under subparagraph 6.02(a) above 
in the absence of such Termination.

            (b)  During the period that the payments provided for in 
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made, the 
Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate, shall continue to 
be entitled to all benefits and service credit for benefits under 
employee benefit plans of the Company as if still employed during such 
period under this Agreement and, if and to the extent that such benefits 
or service credit for benefits shall not be payable or provided under 
any such plans to the Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and 
estate by reason of his no longer being an employee of the Company as 
the result of Termination, the Company shall itself pay or provide for 
payment of such benefits and service credit for benefits to the 
Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate.

            (c)  The period in which the payments provided for in 
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 7.02 are required to be made shall be 
considered service with the Company for the purpose (i) of continued 
credits under the Company's retirement program (consisting of the 
Parker-Hannifin Corporation Retirement Plan, any excess benefits plan or 
other

                                 -12-
<PAGE>

program designed to restore benefits unavailable under the tax-qualified 
plans of the Company solely by application of the requirements of the 
Code, if any, and its Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits 
Program) as each such plan or program was in effect immediately prior to 
Termination (but without giving effect to any reduction of benefits 
thereunder as the result of amendment or termination of any such Plan or 
Program during the Period of Employment) and (ii) of all other benefit 
plans of the Company as in effect immediately prior to Termination.

           (d)  In the event that the Executive shall at the time of 
Termination hold an outstanding and unexercised (whether or not 
exercisable at the time) non-statutory stock option or options 
theretofore granted by the Company, the Company shall, in addition to 
the amounts provided for in subparagraphs 7.02(a) and 7.02(b), pay to 
the Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to the excess above the 
option price under each such non-statutory stock option of the Fair 
Market Value at the time of Termination of the shares subject to each 
such non-statutory stock option.  Solely for the purpose of this 
subparagraph (d), Fair Market Value at the time of Termination shall be 
deemed to mean the higher of (i) the average of the reported closing 
prices of the Common Shares of the Company, as reported on the New York 
Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions, on the last trading day prior to 
the Termination and on the last trading day of each of the two preceding 
thirty (30) day periods, and (ii) in the event that a Change in Control, 
as defined in Section 17 below, prior to Termination shall have taken 
place as the result of a tender or exchange offer and such Change in 
Control was consummated within twelve (12) months of Termination, the 
highest consideration paid for Common Shares of the Company in the 
course of such tender or exchange offer.  Upon receiving the payment 
from the Company called for by clause (i)

                                 -13-
<PAGE>

of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 7.02, the Executive shall execute 
and deliver to the Company a general release in favor of the Company, 
its successors and assigns, in respect of any and all matters, 
including, without limitation, any and all rights under any outstanding 
and unexercisable non-statutory stock options at the time of 
Termination, except for the payments and obligations required to be made 
or assumed by the Company under this Agreement which at the time had not 
yet been made or assumed by the Company and except for such other valid 
obligations of the Company as shall be set forth in such release. 

            (e)  If as a result of a termination of employment pursuant 
to the provisions of paragraph 7.03(b) the Executive (or anyone claiming 
under or through him) loses any part or all of the benefits he would 
have received as a Participant in the Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Benefits Program of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the 
Operative Date, the Company will provide him with a substantially 
equivalent benefit.

     7.03  The word "Termination", for the purpose of this Section 7 and 
any other provision of this Agreement, shall mean:

            (a)  Termination by the Company of the employment of the 
Executive by the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason other than 
for Cause as defined in paragraph 7.05 below or for Disability as 
defined in subparagraph 6.02(a) above; or

            (b)  Termination by the Executive of his employment by the 
Company and its subsidiaries upon the occurrence of any of the following 
events:

                  (i)  Failure to elect or reelect the Executive to the 
Board of Directors of the Company, if the Executive shall have been a 
member of the Board of Directors immediately prior to the Operative 
Date, or failure to elect or reelect the Executive

                                 -14-
<PAGE>

to, or removal of the Executive from, any of the office(s) described in 
paragraph 3.01(a)(i) above and intended to be summarized in Exhibit B to 
this Agreement.

                 (ii)  A significant change in the nature or scope of 
the authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to the position 
described in paragraph 3.01(a)(i) above and intended to be summarized in 
Exhibit B to this Agreement, or a reduction in compensation, which is 
not remedied within 30 days after receipt by the Company of written 
notice from the Executive.

                (iii)  A determination by the Executive made in good 
faith that as a result of a Change in Control of the Company, as defined 
in Section 17 below, and a change in circumstances on or after the 
Operative Date significantly affecting his position, he is unable to 
carry out the authorities, powers, functions or duties attached to his 
position and contemplated by Section 3 of this Agreement and the 
situation is not remedied within 30 days after receipt by the Company of 
written notice from the Executive of such determination.

                 (iv)  A breach by the Company of any provision of this 
Agreement not embraced within the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) 
of this subparagraph 7.03(b) which is not remedied within 30 days after 
receipt by the Company of written notice from the Executive.

                  (v)  The liquidation, dissolution, consolidation or 
merger of the Company or transfer of all or a significant portion of its 
assets unless a successor or successors (by merger, consolidation or 
otherwise) to which all or a significant portion of its assets have been 
transferred shall have assumed all duties and obligations of the Company 
under this Agreement; provided that in any event set forth in this

                                 -15-
<PAGE>

subparagraph 7.03(b) above, the Executive shall have elected to 
terminate his employment under this Agreement upon not less than forty 
and not more than ninety days' advance written notice to the Board of 
Directors of the Company, Attention of the Secretary, given, except in 
the case of a continuing breach, within three calendar months after (A)
failure to be so elected or reelected, or removal, (B) expiration of the 
thirty (30) day cure period with respect to such event, or (C) the 
closing date of such liquidation, dissolution, consolidation, merger or 
transfer of assets, as the case may be. An election by the Executive to 
terminate his employment given under the provisions of this paragraph 
7.03 shall not be deemed a voluntary termination of employment by the 
Executive for the purpose of this Agreement or any plan or practice of 
the Company.

     7.04   (a)  There shall be no obligation on the part of the Company 
to make any further payments provided for in paragraph 7.02 above or to 
provide any further benefits specified in such paragraph 7.02 if the 
Executive shall, during the period that such payments are being made or 
benefits provided, engage in Competition with the Company as hereinafter 
defined, provided all of the following shall have taken place:

                  (i)  the Secretary of the Company, pursuant to 
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, shall have given 
written notice to the Executive that, in the opinion of the Board of 
Directors, the Executive is engaged in such Competition, specifying the 
details; 

                 (ii)  the Executive shall have been give a reasonable 
opportunity to appear

                                 -16-
<PAGE>

before the Board of Directors prior to the determination of the Board 
evidenced by such resolution; and

                (iii) the Executive shall neither have ceased to engage 
in such Competition within thirty (30) days from his receipt of such 
notice nor diligently taken all reasonable steps to that end during such 
thirty (30) day period and thereafter.

            (b)  The word "Competition" for purposes of this paragraph 
7.04 and any other provision of this Agreement shall mean taking a 
management position with, or control of, a business engaged in the 
manufacture, processing, purchase of distribution of products which 
constituted 15% or more of the sales of the Company and its subsidiaries 
and divisions during the last fiscal year of the Company preceding the 
termination of the Executive's employment (or during any fiscal year of 
the Company during the Period of Employment); provided, however, that in 
no event shall ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding capital 
stock entitled to vote for the election of directors of a corporation 
with a class of equity securities held of record by more than 500 
persons, standing alone, be deemed Competition with the Company within 
the meaning of this paragraph 7.04.

     7.05  For the purpose of any provision of this Agreement, the 
termination of the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been 
for Cause only:

            (a)  if termination of his employment shall have been the 
result of an act or acts of dishonesty on the part of the Executive 
constituting a felony and resulting or intended to result directly or 
indirectly in gain or personal enrichment at the expense of the Company, 
or

                                 -17-
<PAGE>

            (b)  if there has been a breach by the Executive during the 
Period of Employment of the provisions of paragraph 3.03 above, relating 
to the time to be devoted to the affairs of the Company, or of Section 
9, relating to confidential information, and such breach results in 
demonstrably material injury to the Company, and with respect to any 
alleged breach of paragraph 3.03 hereof, the Executive shall have both 
failed to remedy such alleged breach within thirty (30) days from his 
receipt of written notice by the Secretary of the Company pursuant to 
resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company after 
notice to the Executive and an opportunity to be heard demanding that he 
remedy such alleged breach, and failed to take all reasonable steps to 
that end during such thirty (30) day period and thereafter; provided 
that there shall have been delivered to the Executive a certified copy 
of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted by the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths (3/4) of the entire 
membership of the Board of Directors called and held for that purpose 
and at which the Executive was given an opportunity to be heard, finding 
that the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in subparagraphs (a) 
or (b) above, specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

     Anything in this paragraph 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement to 
the contrary notwithstanding, the employment of the Executive shall in 
no event be considered to have been terminated by the Company for Cause 
if termination of his employment took place (i) as the result of bad 
judgment or negligence on the part of the Executive, or (ii) as the 
result of an act or omission without intent of gaining therefrom 
directly or indirectly a profit to which the Executive was not legally 
entitled, or (iii) because of an act or omission believed by the 
Executive in good faith to have been in or not opposed to the interests 
of the Company, or (iv) for any act or omission in respect of which a 
determination could properly

                                 -18-
<PAGE>

be made that the Executive met the applicable standard of conduct 
prescribed for indemnification or reimbursement or payment of expenses 
under the Code of Regulations of the Company or the laws of the State of 
Ohio or the directors' and officers' liability insurance of the Company, 
in each case as in effect at the time of such act or omission, or (v) as 
the result of an act or omission which occurred more than twelve (12) 
calendar months prior to the Executive's having been given notice of the 
termination of his employment for such act or omission unless the 
commission of such act or such omission could not at the time of such 
commission or omission have been known to a member of the Board of 
Directors of the Company (other than the Executive, if he is then a 
member of the Board of Directors), in which case more than twelve (12) 
calendar months from the date that the commission of such act or such 
omission was or could reasonably have been so known, or (vi) as the 
result of a continuing course of action which commenced and was or could 
reasonably have been known to a member of the Board of Directors of the 
Company (other than the Executive) more than twelve (12) calendar months 
prior to notice having been given to the Executive of the termination of 
his employment.

     7.06  In the event that the Executive's employment shall be 
terminated by the Company during the Period of Employment and such 
termination is alleged to be for Cause, or the Executive's right to 
terminate his employment under paragraph 7.03(b) above shall be 
questioned by the Company, or the Company shall withhold payments or 
provision of benefits because the Executive is alleged to be engaged in 
Competition in breach of the provisions of paragraph 7.04 above or for 
any other reason, the Executive shall have the right, in addition to all 
other rights and remedies provided by law, at his election either to

                                 -19-
<PAGE>

seek arbitration within the area within which the office of the 
Executive was located immediately prior to the Operative Date and 
intended to be described in Exhibit D to this Agreement under the rules 
of the American Arbitration Association by serving a notice to arbitrate 
upon the Company or to institute a judicial proceeding, in either case 
within ninety (90) days after having received notice of termination of 
his employment or notice in any form that the termination of his 
employment under paragraph 7.03(b) is subject to question or that the 
Company is withholding or proposed to withhold payments or provision of 
benefits or within such longer period as may reasonably be necessary for 
the Executive to take action in the event that his illness or incapacity 
should preclude his taking such action within such ninety (90) day 
period.

     7.07  Any provision above in this Section 7 to the contrary 
notwithstanding, if the Company should default on any obligation set 
forth in this Section 7 and shall have failed to remedy such default 
within thirty (30) days after having received written notice of such 
default from the Executive or his beneficiaries, then, in that event:

            (a)  any and all undischarged, future obligations of the 
Company under this Section 7 shall, at the sole option of the Executive 
or his beneficiaries, exercised in writing signed by the Executive or 
his beneficiaries, as the case may be, and delivered to the Company 
within ninety (90) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day 
period, become immediately due and payable in a lump sum discounted to 
present value using the "Federal short-term rate," "Federal mid-term 
rate" or "Federal long-term rate" that would apply at the time under 
section 1274(d) of the Code to a debt instrument having a term equal to 
the period extending from the date such option is exercised in writing 
to the date or dates such

                                 -20-
<PAGE>

future obligations of the Company would otherwise have become due and 
payable; and

            (b)  in addition to, and not in substitution for, interest 
for any other period properly payable to the Executive as a result of 
such default, the Company agrees to pay pre-judgment interest on any 
such obligation in default, calculated at the "Federal short-term rate," 
"Federal mid-term rate" or "Federal long-term rate" that would apply at 
the time under section 1274(d) of the Code to a debt instrument having a 
term equal to the period extending from the date that the Company's 
obligation became due and payable hereunder to the date the Executive or 
his beneficiaries obtain a money judgment therefor (whether in 
litigation or arbitration).

     8.  OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DAMAGES

     8.01  In the event of a Termination, as defined in paragraph 7.03 
above, the Executive shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages 
by seeking other employment; provided, however, that he shall not be 
required to accept a position of less dignity and importance or of 
substantially different character than the highest position theretofore 
held by him with the Company or a position that would call upon him to 
engage in competition within the meaning of paragraph 7.04(b) above, nor 
shall he be required to accept a position other than in a location 
reasonably convenient to his principal residence immediately prior to 
such Termination.

     8.02  To the extent that the Executive shall receive compensation, 
benefits and service credit for benefits from other employment secured 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8.01 above, the payments to be 
made and the benefits and service credit for

                                 -21-
<PAGE>

benefits to be provided by the Company under the provisions of paragraph 
7.02 above shall be correspondingly reduced.  Such reduction shall, in 
the event of any question, be determined jointly by the firm of 
certified public accountants of the Company and the firm of certified 
public accountants selected by the Executive, in each case upon the 
advice of actuaries to the extent the certified public accountants 
consider necessary, and, in the event such accountants are unable to 
agree on a resolution of the question, such reduction shall be 
determined by an independent firm of certified public accountants 
selected jointly by both firms of accountants.

     9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

     9.01  The Executive agrees not to disclose, either while in the 
Company's employ or at any time thereafter, to any person not employed 
by the Company, or not engaged to render services to the Company, any 
confidential information obtained by him while in the employ of the 
Company, including, without limitation, any of the Company's inventions, 
processes, methods of distribution, customers or trade secrets; 
provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude the Executive 
from use or disclosure of information known generally to the public or 
of information not considered confidential by persons engaged in the 
business conducted by the Company or from disclosure required by law or 
Court order.

     9.02  The Executive also agrees that upon leaving the Company's 
employ, he will not take with him, without the prior written consent of 
an officer authorized to act in the matter by the Board of Directors of 
the Company, any drawing, blueprint, specification or other document of 
the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, which is of a

                                 -22-
<PAGE>

confidential nature relating to the Company, its subsidiaries, 
affiliates and divisions, or without limitation, relating to its or 
their methods of distribution, or any description of any formulae or 
secret processes.

     9.03  The Executive further agrees that upon leaving the Company's 
employ (or prior to leaving, if in connection with an intention of the 
Executive to leave), he will not solicit any other employee of the 
Company or otherwise cause any other employee to consider terminating 
employment with the Company without the prior written consent of an 
officer authorized to act in the matter by the Board of Directors of the 
Company.

    10.  SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE

     In the event that, following the date stated in Exhibit A attached 
to and made part of this Agreement, the employment of the Executive 
shall be terminated by the Company prior to his normal retirement date 
and such termination shall be for any reason other than for Cause, as 
defined in paragraph 7.05 above, the Company shall pay the Executive as 
a severance allowance a lump sum equal to the Minimum Total Monthly 
Compensation for the month prior to such termination of employment, 
multiplied by six. 

    11.  WITHHOLDING

     Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to 
be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive or his estate or 
beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if

reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to any applicable law

                                 -23-

or regulation.  In lieu of withholding such amounts, the Company may

such payments.

    13.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

    13.01  This Agreement is not intended to and shall not infer or 
imply any right on the part of the Executive to continue in the employ 
of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, prior to 
a Change in Control of the Company, and is not intended in any way to 
limit the right of the Company to terminate the employment of the 
Executive, with or without assigning a reason therefor, at any time 
prior to a Change in Control of the Company.  Nor is this Agreement 
intended to nor shall it infer or imply any obligation on the part of 
the Executive to continue in the employment of the Company, or any 
subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, prior to a Change in Control of 
the Company.  Neither the Company nor the Executive shall incur any 
liability under this Agreement if the employment of the Executive shall 
be terminated by the Company or by the Executive prior to a Change in 
Control of the Company.

Agreement.

    13.03  The Company and the Executive recognize that each party will

be entitled to a decree of specific performance, mandamus or other 
appropriate remedy to enforce performance of such agreements.

                                 -25-
<PAGE>

    13.04  No right or interest to or in any payments shall be 
assignable by the Executive; provided, however, that this provision 
shall not preclude him from designating one or more beneficiaries to 
receive any amount that may be payable after his death and shall not 
preclude the legal representative of his estate from assigning any right 
hereunder to the person or persons entitled thereto under his will or, 
in the case of intestacy, to the person or persons entitled thereto 
under the laws of intestacy applicable to his estate.  The term 
"beneficiaries" as used in this Agreement shall mean a beneficiary or 
beneficiaries so designated to receive any such amount or, if no 
beneficiary has been so designated, the legal representative of the 
Executive's estate.

    13.05  No right, benefit or interest hereunder, shall be subject to 
anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge,

take place on a legal holiday, such event shall take place on the next 
succeeding day that is not a legal holiday.

    13.08  The titles to sections in this Agreement are intended solely 
for convenience and no provision of this Agreement is to be construed by 
reference to the title of any section.

benefit of the Executive, his heirs and legal representatives, and the 
Company and its successors as provided in Section 16 hereof.

    13.10  This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties 
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes and 
replaces all prior agreements and understandings with respect to such 
subject matter, and the parties hereto have made no agreements, 
representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this 
Agreement which are not set forth herein.

    14.  AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION, WAIVER

     No provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived 
unless such amendment, modification or waiver shall be authorized by the 
Board of Directors of the Company or any authorized committee of the 
Board of Directors and shall be agreed to in writing, signed by the 
Executive and by an officer of the Company thereunto duly authorized.  
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, no waiver 
by either party hereto of any breach by the other party hereto of any 
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other 
party shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent breach of such condition 
or provision or a waiver of a similar or dissimilar provision or 
condition at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.

    15.  SEVERABILITY

     Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:

            (a)  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or 
portion thereof, shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for 
any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this 
Agreement and parts of such provision not so invalid or unenforceable 
shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to 
the fullest extent permitted by law.

            (b)  Any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, 
which may be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be 
limited by construction thereof, to the end that such provision, or 
portion thereof, shall be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction; 
and

                                 -27-
<PAGE>

            (c)  Any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, 
which may for any reason be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction 
shall remain in effect and be enforceable in any jurisdiction in which 
such provision, or portion thereof, shall be valid and enforceable.

    16.  SUCCESSORS TO THE COMPANY

     Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor 
of the Company, including, without limitation, any corporation or 
corporations acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all 
of the assets of the Company whether by merger, consolidation, sale or 
otherwise (and such successor shall thereafter be deemed "the Company" 
for the purposes of this Agreement), but shall not otherwise be 
assignable by the Company.

    17.  CHANGE IN CONTROL

     For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control of 
the Company" shall mean a change in control of a nature that would be 
required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of 
Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as 
in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that, without 
limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if 
and when (a) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) is or becomes a 
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company 
representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's 
then outstanding securities or (b) during any period of 24 consecutive 
months, commencing before or after the date of this Agreement, 
individuals who at the beginning of such twenty-four (24) month period 
were directors of the Company for whom the Executive shall have voted 
cease for any reasons (other than death, disability or retirement 
pursuant to the Company's policy relating to retirement of directors, if 
any, in effect on the date of this Agreement) to constitute at least a 
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company.

    18.  INTENTION RELATING TO RECENT LEGISLATION,
         POSSIBLE FUTURE AMENDMENTS

    18.01  The Company and the Executive intend that this Agreement 
shall be performed according to its terms hereinbefore set forth, and 
that such performance shall not give rise to or result in any payment or 
benefit being subject to the Excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the 
Code or the related loss of deduction mandated by Section 280G(a) of the 
Code.  Each and every provision of this Agreement shall be administered, 
interpreted and construed to carry out such intention.

    18.02  As a result of the issuance of proposed regulations on May 5, 
1989, and with respect to paragraph 18.01 of this Agreement, the amount 
to be paid to the Executive under this Agreement upon a Change in 
Control of the Company shall be limited to an amount not to exceed two 
hundred ninety-nine percent (299%) of the "disqualified individual's 
base amount" as those terms are defined in Regulation 1.280G-1.  The 
Company and the Executive recognize that there are as yet no final 
regulations or rulings under, or official interpretations of Sections 
280G(a) and 4999.  Accordingly, the Company and the Executive agree 
that, when Treasury Regulations are issued in proposed or final form 
under Section 280G or 4999 of the Code or relevant rulings or official 
interpretations are promulgated, they will at that time, or from time to 
time, review this Agreement and take such action, including executing 
amendments hereto, as the Company and the Executive may agree to be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the aforesaid intention.

                    INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT



          This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement") is made as
of the ____ day of ______, 19__, by and between Parker-Hannifin
Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and __________
_____ (the "Indemnitee"), a Director of the Company.


                            RECITALS

          A.   The Indemnitee is presently serving as a Director of
the Company and the Company desires the Indemnitee to continue in
that capacity.  The Indemnitee is willing, subject to certain
conditions including without limitation the execution and perfor-
mance of this Agreement by the Company, to continue in that
capacity.

          B.   In addition to the indemnification to which the
Indemnitee is entitled under the Regulations of the Company (the
"Regulations"), the Company has obtained, as its sole expense,
insurance protecting the Company and its officers and directors
including the Indemnitee against certain losses arising out of
actual or threatened actions, suits, or proceedings to which such
persons may be made or threatened to be made parties.  However, as
a result of circumstances having no relation to, and beyond the
control of, the Company and the Indemnitee, the scope of that
insurance has been reduced and there can be no assurance of the
continuation or renewal of that insurance.

          Accordingly, and in order to induce the Indemnitee to
continue to serve in his present capacity, the Company and the
Indemnitee agree as follows:

          1.   Continued Service.  The Indemnitee shall continue to
serve at the will of the Company as a Director of the Company so
long as he is duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
Regulations or until he resigns in writing in accordance with
applicable law.

          2.   Initial Indemnity.  (a)  The Company shall indemnify
the Indemnitee, if or when he is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Company), by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director of the
Company or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in 

<PAGE>
                                                            2

any such capacity, against any and all costs, charges,
expenses (including without limitation fees and expenses of
attorneys and/or others; all such costs, charges and expenses being
herein jointly referred to as "Expenses"), judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection therewith including any appeal of or from
any judgment or decision, unless it is proved by clear and
convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Indemnitee's action or failure to act involved an act or omission
undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to the Company or
undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the
Company.  In addition, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, indemnification hereunder shall be made only if the
Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the Indemnitee did not satisfy the foregoing
standard of conduct to the extent applicable thereto.

          (b)  The Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee, if or
when he is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding by or
in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor, by
reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a Director of the
Company against any and all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or
settlement thereof or any appeal of or from any judgment or
decision, unless it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in
a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnitee's action or
failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with
deliberate intent to cause injury to the Company or undertaken with
reckless disregard for the best interests of the Company, except
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any action or
suit in which the only liability asserted against Indemnitee is
pursuant to Section 1701.95 of the Ohio Revised Code.

          (c)  Any indemnification under Section 2(a) or 2(b)
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemni-
fication of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because
he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section
2(a) or 2(b).  Such authorization shall be made (i) by the
Directors of the Company (the "Board") by a majority vote of a
quorum consisting of Directors who were not and are not parties to
or threatened with such action, suit, or proceeding, or (ii) if
such a quorum of disinterested Directors is not available or if a

<PAGE>
                                                              3

majority of such quorum so directs, in a written opinion by
independent legal counsel (designated for such purpose by the
Board) which shall not be an attorney, or a firm having associated
with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has performed
services for the Company, or any person to be indemnified, within
the five years preceding such determination, or (iii) by the
shareholders of the Company (the "Shareholders"), or (iv) by the
court in which such action, suit, or proceeding was brought.

          (d)  To the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful
on the merits or otherwise, including without limitation the
dismissal of an action without prejudice, in defense of any action,
suit, or proceeding referred to in Section 2(a) or 2(b), or in
defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection therewith.  Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any such action, suit, or
proceeding shall be paid by the Company as they are incurred in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding
under the procedure set forth in Section 4(b) hereof.

          (e)  For purposes of this Agreement, references to "other
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to
"fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on the Indemnitee
with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving
at the request of the Company" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company which imposes
duties on, or involves services by, the Indemnitee with respect to
an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries;
references to the masculine shall include the feminine; and
references to the singular shall include the plural and vice versa.

          3.   Additional Indemnification.  Pursuant to Section
1701.13(E)(6) of the Ohio Revised Code (the "ORC"), without
limiting any right which the Indemnitee may have pursuant to
Section 2 hereof or any other provision of this Agreement or the
Articles, the Regulations, the ORC, any policy of insurance, or
otherwise, but subject to any limitation on the maximum permissible
indemnity which may exist under applicable law at the time of any
request for indemnity hereunder and subject to the following
provisions of this Section 3, the Company shall indemnify the
Indemnitee against any amount which he is or becomes obligated to
pay relating to or arising out of any claim made against him
because of any act, failure to act, or neglect or breach of duty,
including any actual or alleged error, misstatement, or misleading
statement, which he commits, suffers, permits, or acquiesces in
while acting in his capacity as a Director of the Company.  The

<PAGE>
                                                               4

payments which the Company is obligated to make pursuant to this
Section 3 shall include without limitation, judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement and any and all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith
including any appeal of or from any judgment or decision; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated under this Section
3 to make any payment in connection with any claim against the
Indemnitee:

          (a)  to the extent of any fine or similar governmental
     imposition which the Company is prohibited by applicable law
     from paying which results from a final, nonappealable order;
     or

          (b)  to the extent based upon or attributable to the
     Indemnitee having actually realized a personal gain or profit
     to which he was not legally entitled, including without
     limitation profit from the purchase and sale by the Indemnitee
     of equity securities of the Company which are recoverable by
     the Company pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934, or profit arising from transactions in
     publicly traded securities of the Company which were effected
     by the Indemnitee in violation of Section 10(b) of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Rule 10b-5 promulgated
     thereunder.

A determination as to whether the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 3 shall be made in accordance
with Section 4(a) hereof.  Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in
defending any claim to which this Section 3 applies shall be paid
by the Company as they are actually and reasonably incurred in
advance of the final disposition of such claim under the procedure
set forth in Section 4(b) hereof.

          4.   Certain Procedures Relating to Indemnification.  
(a) For purposes of pursuing his rights to indemnification under
Section 3 hereof, the Indemnitee shall (i) submit to the Board a
sworn statement of request for indemnification substantially in the
form of Exhibit 1 attached hereto and made a part hereof (the
"Indemnification Statement") averring that he is entitled to
indemnification hereunder and (ii) present to the Company
reasonable evidence of all amounts for which indemnification is
requested.  Submission of an Indemnification Statement to the Board
shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, and the Company shall, within 60
calendar days after submission of the Indemnification Statement,
make the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement to or

<PAGE>
                                                              5

for the benefit of the Indemnitee, unless (i) within such 60-
calendar-day period the Board shall resolve by vote of a majority
of the Directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under Section 3
hereof, (ii) such vote shall be based upon clear and convincing
evidence (sufficient to rebut the foregoing presumption), and (iii)
the Indemnitee shall have received within such period notice in
writing of such vote, which notice shall disclose with particular-
ity the evidence upon which the vote is based.  The foregoing
notice shall be sworn to by all persons who participated in the
vote and voted to deny indemnification.  The provisions of this
Section 4(a) are intended to be procedural only and shall not
affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification under Section 3
of this Agreement so long as Indemnitee follows the prescribed
procedure and any determination by the Board that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification and any failure to make the payments
requested in the Indemnification Statement shall be subject to
judicial review by any court of competent jurisdiction.

          (b)  For purposes of obtaining payments of Expenses in
advance of final disposition pursuant to the second sentence of
Section 2(d) or the last sentence of Section 3 hereof, the
Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a sworn request for
advancement of Expenses substantially in the form of Exhibit 2
attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Undertaking"),
averring that he has reasonably incurred actual Expenses in
defending an action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 2(a)
or 2(b) or any claim referred to in Section 3, or pursuant to
Section 8 hereof.  Unless at the time of the Indemnitee's act or
omission at issue, the Articles of Incorporation or Regulations of
the Company prohibit such advances by specific reference to ORC
Section 1701.13(E)(5)(a) and unless the only liability asserted
against the Indemnitee in the subject action, suit or proceeding is
pursuant to ORC Section 1701.95, the Indemnitee shall be eligible
to execute Part A of the Undertaking by which he undertakes to (a)
repay such amount if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence
in a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnitee's action
or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with
deliberate intent to cause injury to the Company or undertaken with
reckless disregard for the best interests of the Company and (b)
reasonably cooperate with the Company concerning the action, suit,
proceeding or claim.  In all cases, the Indemnitee shall be
eligible to execute Part B of the Undertaking by which he under-
takes to repay such amount if it ultimately is determined that he
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under this
Agreement or otherwise.  In the event that the Indemnitee is
eligible to and does execute both Part A and Part B of the

Undertaking, the Expenses which are paid by the Company pursuant
thereto shall be required to be repaid by the Indemnitee only if he
is required to do so under the terms of both Part A and Part B of
the Undertaking.  Upon receipt of the Undertaking, the Company
shall thereafter promptly pay such Expenses of the Indemnitee as
are noticed to the Company in writing and in reasonable detail
arising out of the matter described in the Undertaking.  No
security shall be required in connection with any Undertaking.

          5.   Limitation on Indemnity.  Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required
hereby to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to any action,
suit, or proceeding that was initiated by the Indemnitee unless (i)
such action, suit, or proceeding was initiated by the Indemnitee to
enforce any rights to indemnification arising hereunder and such
person shall have been formally adjudged to be entitled to
indemnity by reason hereof, (ii) authorized by another agreement to
which the Company is a party whether heretofore or hereafter
entered, or (iii) otherwise ordered by the court in which the suit
was brought.

          6.   Subrogation; Duplication of Payments.  (a) In the
event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be
subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and
shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the
Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

          (b)  The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement
to make any payment in connection with any claim made against
Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has actually received payment
(under any insurance policy, the Company's Regulations or other-
wise) of the amounts otherwise payable hereunder.

          7.   Ratification.  The Company may, at its option,
propose at any future meeting of Shareholders that this Agreement
be ratified by the Shareholders; if the Shareholders vote not to
ratify this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to amend
this Agreement without the consent of the Indemnitee; provided,
however, that no such amendment or termination shall deny or
diminish the Indemnitee's rights to indemnity pursuant hereto (or
the procedures set forth herein to obtain indemnification) as
applied to any act or failure to act occurring in whole or in part
prior to the date of such amendment or termination (whether or not
a claim hereunder is made before or after such date).

                                                               7

          8.   Fees and Expenses of Enforcement.  It is the intent
of the Company that the Indemnitee not be required to incur the
expenses associated with the enforcement of his rights under this
Agreement by litigation or other legal action  because the cost and
expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits
intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder.  Accordingly,
if it should appear to the Indemnitee that the Company has failed
to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in
the event that the Company or any other person takes any action to
declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any
action, suit or proceeding to deny, or to recover from, the
Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to the Indemnitee
hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Indemnitee from
time to time to retain counsel of his choice, at the expense of the
Company as hereafter provided, to represent the Indemnitee in
connection with the initiation or defense of any litigation or
other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any
director, officer, shareholder, or other person affiliated with the
Company, in any jurisdiction.  Regardless of the outcome thereof,
the Company shall pay and be solely responsible for any and all
costs, charges, and expenses including, without limitation fees
and expenses of attorneys and others, reasonably incurred by the
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 8.

          9.   Merger of Consolidation.  In the event that the
Company shall be a constituent corporation in a consolidation,
merger, or other reorganization, the Company, if it shall not be
the surviving, resulting, or acquiring corporation therein, shall
require as a condition thereto that the surviving, resulting, or
acquiring corporation agree to assume all of the obligations of the
Company hereunder and to indemnify the Indemnitee to the full
extent provided herein.  Whether or not the Company is the
resulting, surviving, or acquiring corporation in any such
transaction, the Indemnitee shall also stand in the same position
under the Agreement with respect to the resulting, surviving, or
acquiring corporation as he would have with respect to the Company
if its separate existence had continued.

          10.  Nonexclusivity and Severability.  (a)  The rights to
indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be exclusive
of any other rights of indemnification to which the Indemnitee may
be entitled under the Articles, the Regulations, the ORC or any
other statute, any insurance policy, agreement, or vote of
shareholders or directors or otherwise, as to any actions or
failures to act by the Indemnitee, and shall continue after he has
ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company
or other entity for which his service gives rise to a right

                                                               8

hereunder, and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors,
and administrators.  In the event of any payment under this
Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent thereof to
all rights of recovery previously vested in the Indemnitee, who
shall execute all instruments and take all other actions as shall
be reasonably necessary for the Company to enforce such right.

          (b)  If any provision of this Agreement or the applica-
tion of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held
invalid, unenforceable, or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected, and the provision so held to
be invalid, unenforceable, or otherwise illegal shall be reformed
to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it
enforceable, valid, and legal.

          11.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio,
without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws
thereof.

          12.  Modification.  This Agreement and the rights and
duties of the Indemnitee and the Company hereunder may be modified
only by an instrument in writing signed by both parties hereto.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed
this Agreement as of the date first above written.

                             declines to accept renewal, the Company may, if 
                             requested, at its sole option, grant an Extended 
                             Reporting Period. The offer of renewal terms and 
                             conditions or premiums different from those in 
                             effect prior to renewal shall not constitute 
                             refusal to renew.

Reporting              10.   The Insureds shall, as a condition precedent to 
and Notice                   exercising their rights under this coverage 
                             section, give to the Company written notice as 
                             soon as practicable of any Claim made against any
                             of them for a Wrongful Act.

                             If during the Policy Period or Extended Reporting
                             Period (if exercised) an Insured becomes aware of
                             circumstances which could give rise to a Claim 
                             and gives written notice of such circumstance(s) 
                             to the Company, then any Claims subsequently
                             arising from such circumstances shall be 
                             considered to have been made during the Policy 
                             Period or the Extended Reporting Period in which 
                             the circumstances were first reported to the 
                             Company.

                             The Insureds shall, as a condition precedent to 
                             exercising their rights under this coverage 
                             section, give to the Company such information and
                             cooperation as it may reasonably require, 
                             including but not limited to a description of the
                             Claim or circumstances, the nature of the alleged
                             Wrongful Act, the nature of the alleged or 
                             potential damage, the names of actual or 
                             potential claimants, and the manner in which the 
                             Insured first became aware of the Claim or 
                             circumstances.


Defense and            11.   Subject to this Subsection, it shall be the duty 
Settlement                   of the Insured Persons and not the duty of the 
                             Company to defend Claims made against the Insured
                             Persons.

                             The Insureds agree not to settle any Claim, incur
                             any Defense Costs or otherwise assume any 
                             contractual obligation or admit any liability 
                             with respect to any Claim without the Company's 
                             written consent, which shall not be unreasonably 
                             withheld. The Company shall not be liable for any
                             settlement, Defense Costs, assumed obligation or 
                             admission to which it has not consented.

                             The Company shall have the right and shall be 
                             given the opportunity to effectively associate 
                             with the Insureds in the investigation, defense 
                             and settlement, including but not limited to the 
                             negotiation of a settlement, of any Claim that 
                             appears reasonably likely to be covered in whole 
                             or in part by this coverage section.

                             The Insureds agree to provide the Company with 
                             all information, assistance and cooperation which
                             the Company reasonably requests and agree that in
                             the event of a Claim the Insureds will do nothing
                             that may prejudice the Company's position or its 
                             potential or actual rights of recovery.

                             Defense Costs are part of and not in addition to
                             the Limits of Liability set forth in Item 2 of 
                             the Declarations for this coverage section, and 
                             the payment by the Company of Defense Costs 
                             reduces such Limits of Liability.


Allocation             12.   If both Loss covered by this coverage section and
                             loss not covered by this coverage section are 
                             incurred, either because a claim against the 
                             Insured Persons includes both covered and 
                             uncovered matters or because a Claim is made 
                             against both an Insured Person and others, 
                             including the Insured Organization, the Insureds 
                             and the Company shall use their best efforts to
                             agree upon a fair and proper allocation of such 
                             amount between covered Loss and uncovered loss.

Allocation                   If the Insureds and the Company agree on an 
(continued)                  allocation of Defense Costs, the Company shall 
                             advance on a current basis Defense Costs 
                             allocated to the covered Loss. If the Insureds 
                             and the Company cannot agree on an allocation:

                             (a) no presumption as to allocation shall exist 
                                 in any arbitration, suit or other proceeding;

                             (b) the Company shall advance on a current basis 
                                 Defense Costs which the Company believes to 
                                 be covered under this coverage section until 
                                 a different allocation is negotiated, 
                                 arbitrated or judicially determined; and

                             (c) the Company, if requested by the Insureds, 
                                 shall submit the dispute to binding 
                                 arbitration. The rules of the American 
                                 Arbitration Association shall apply except 
                                 with respect to the selection of the 
                                 arbitration panel, which shall consist of one 
                                 arbitrator selected by the Insureds, one 
                                 arbitrator selected by the Company, and a 
                                 third independent arbitrator selected by
                                 the first two arbitrators.

                             Any negotiated, arbitrated or judicially 
                             determined allocation of Defense Costs
                             on account of a Claim shall be applied 
                             retroactively to all Defense Costs on
                             account of such Claim, notwithstanding any prior 
                             advancement to the contrary.  Any allocation or 
                             advancement of Defense Costs on account of a 
                             Claim shall not apply to or create any 
                             presumption with respect to the allocation of 
                             other Loss on account of such Claim.


Other                  13.   If any Loss arising from any Claim made against 
Insurance                    any Insured Persons is insured under any other 
                             valid policy(ies), prior or current, then this 
                             coverage section shall cover such Loss, subject 
                             to its limitations, conditions, provisions and 
                             other terms, only to the extent that the amount 
                             of such Loss is in excess of the amount of 
                             payment from such other insurance whether such 
                             other insurance is stated to be primary, 
                             contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise,
                             unless such other insurance is written only as 
                             specific excess insurance over the Limits of 
                             Liability provided in this coverage section.

alleged Wrongful Acts of the Insured Person, all loss which such spouse 
becomes legally obligated to pay on account of such Claim shall be treated for
purposes of this coverage section as Loss which the Insured Person becomes

Deductible and               2 shall apply only to that part of each Loss

(continued)                  forth in Item 4 of the Declarations for this 
                             coverage section and such Deductible Amount 
                             shall be borne by the Insureds uninsured and 
                             at their own risk.

                             If a single Loss is covered in part under 
                             Insuring Clause 1 and in part under Insuring 
                             Clause 2, the Deductible Amount applicable to 
                             such Loss shall be the Insuring Clause 2 
                             deductible set forth in Item 4 of the 
                             Declarations for this coverage section.

                             With respect to all Loss (excess of the 
                             applicable Deductible Amount) originating

                             bear uninsured and at their own risk that 
                             percent of all such Loss specified as the 
                             Coinsurance Percent in Item 3 of the 
                             Declarations for this coverage section and the 
                             Company's liability hereunder shall apply only 
                             to the remaining percent of all such Loss.

                             For purposes of this Subsection 8 only, the 
                             Extended Reporting Period, if exercised, shall 
                             be part of and not in addition to the 
                             immediately preceding Policy Period.

                             If the Company or any of its subsidiaries or 
                             affiliated companies makes payment under 
                             another policy or another coverage section of 
                             this policy on account of any Claim also 
                             covered under this coverage section, the Limit 
                             of Liability for this coverage section with 
                             respect to such Claim shall be reduced by the 
                             amount of such payment.


Presumptive             9.   If the Insured Organization:
Indemnification
                             (a) fails or refuses, other than for reason of 
                                 Financial Impairment, to indemnify the 
                                 Insured Person for Loss; and

                             (b) is permitted or required to indemnify the 
                                 Insured Person for such Loss to the 
                                 fullest extent permitted or required by law,

                             then, notwithstanding any other conditions, 
                             provisions or terms of this coverage
                             section to the contrary, any payment by the 
                             Company of such Loss shall be subject to (i) 
                             the Insuring Clause 2 Deductible Amount set 
                             forth in Item 4 of the Declarations for this 
                             coverage section and (ii) all of the 
                             Exclusions set forth in Subsections 5 and 6 of 
                             this coverage section.

                             For purposes of this Subsection 9, the 
                             shareholder and board of director
                             resolutions of the Insured Organization shall 
                             be deemed to provide indemnification for such 
                             Loss to the fullest extent permitted or 
                             required by law.


Reporting              10.   The Insureds shall, as a condition precedent 
and Notice                   to exercising their rights under this coverage 
                             section, give to the Company written notice as 
                             soon as practicable of any Claim made against 
                             any of them for a Wrongful Act.

                             If during the Policy Period or Extended 
                             Reporting Period (if exercised) an Insured 
                             becomes aware of circumstances which could 
                             give rise to a Claim and gives written notice 
                             of such circumstance(s) to the Company, then 
                             any Claims subsequently arising from such 
                             circumstances shall be considered to have been
                             reported during the Policy Period or the 
                             Extended Reporting Period in which the 
                             circumstances were first reported to the Company.

Reporting                    The Insureds shall, as a condition precedent 
and Notice                   to exercising their rights under this coverage 
(continued)                  section, give to the Company such information 
                             and cooperation as it may reasonably require, 
                             including but not limited to a description of 
                             the Claim or circumstances, the nature of the 
                             alleged potential damage, the names of actual 
                             or potential claimants, and the manner in 
                             which the Insured first became aware of the 
                             Claims or circumstances.


Defense and            11.   Subject to this Subsection, it shall be the 
Settlement                   duty of the Insured Persons and not
                             the duty of the Company to defend Claims made 
                             against the Insured Person.

                             The Insureds agree not to settle any Claim, 
                             incur any Defense Costs or otherwise assume 
                             any contractual obligation or admit any 
                             liability with respect to any Claim without 
                             the Company's consent, which shall not be 
                             unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not 
                             be liable for any settlement, Defense Costs,
                             assumed obligation or admission to which it 
                             has not consented.

                             The Company shall have the right and shall be 
                             given the opportunity to effectively associate 
                             with the Insureds in the investigation, 
                             defense and settlement, including but not 
                             limited to the negotiation of a settlement, of 
                             any Claim that appears reasonably likely to be 
                             covered in whole or in part by this coverage
                             section.

                             The Insureds agree to provide the Company with 
                             all information, assistance and cooperation 
                             which the Company reasonably requests and 
                             agree that in the event of a Claim the 
                             Insureds will do nothing that may prejudice 
                             the Company's position or its potential or 
                             actual rights of recovery.

                             Defense Costs shall be part of and not in 
                             addition to the Limits of Liability set
                             forth in Item 2 of the Declarations for this 
                             coverage section, and the payment by the 
                             Company of Defense Costs reduces such Limits 
                             of Liability.


Allocation             12.   If both Loss covered by this coverage section 
                             and loss not covered by this coverage section 
                             are incurred, either because a Claim against 
                             the Insured Persons includes both covered and 
                             uncovered matters or because a claim is made 
                             against both an Insured Person and others, 
                             including the Insured Organization, and/or the 
                             Outside Entity, the Insureds and the Company 
                             shall use their best efforts to agree upon a 
                             fair and proper allocation of such amount 
                             between covered Loss and uncovered loss.

                             If the Insureds and the Company agree on an 
                             allocation of Defense Costs, the Company shall 
                             advance on a current basis Defense Costs 
                             allocated to covered Loss. If the Insureds and 
                             the Company cannot agree on an allocation:

                             (a) no presumption as to allocation shall 
                                 exist in any arbitration, suit or other
                                 proceeding;

                             (b) the Company shall advance on a current 
                                 basis Defense Costs which the Company 
                                 believes to be covered under this coverage 
                                 section until a different allocation is 
                                 negotiated arbitrated or judicially 
                                 determined; and

                             (c) the Company, if requested by the Insureds, 
                                 shall submit the dispute to binding 
                                 arbitration. The rules of the American 
                                 Arbitration Association shall apply except 
                                 with respect to the selection of the 
                                 arbitration panel, which shall consist of 
                                 one arbitrator selected by the Insureds, 
                                 one arbitrator selected by the Company, 
                                 and a third independent arbitrator 
                                 selected by the first two arbitrators.

                      PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION
                    1982 EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTION PLAN

                        Effective:  July 8, 1982
                        Amended:   October 25, 1984
                        Amended:   January 29, 1987


     1.  Purpose.  This 1982 Employees Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is
designed to enable the Corporation, by the grant of options, to attract 
and retain key employees for the Corporation and its subsidiaries and to 
provide additional incentive to these employees through increased stock 
ownership.  Options granted under the Plan may be (a) incentive stock 
options within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, 
and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (collectively, the 
"Code"), or (b) nonqualified stock options.

     2.  Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by a committee 
consisting of not less than three directors of the Corporation (the 
"Committee"), to be appointed by, and to serve during the pleasure of, 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  No director who has within 
one year been eligible to participate in the Plan may be appointed or 
serve as a member of the Committee.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, 
the Committee shall have full power and authority to interpret the 
provisions and to supervise the administration of the Plan and to define 
the terms of and grant options under the Plan.  All decisions by the 
committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan 

<PAGE>

shall be made by a majority of its members and shall be final.

     3.  Employees Who May Participate in the Plan.  Employees to whom 
options are granted shall be designated from time to time by the 
Committee.  An option may be granted to any salaried employee of the 
Corporation or of a subsidiary with executive, managerial, technical or 
professional responsibility, including any officer who is a member of the 
Board of Directors.  An employee may hold more than one option; provided, 
however, that:

         (a) for incentive stock options granted prior to January 1, 
1987, no employee may be granted incentive stock options in any calendar 
year (under all plans of the Corporation and its subsidiaries) for shares 
which exceed an aggregate fair market value, determined as of the date of 
grant, of $100,000 plus any unused limit carryover to that year.  The 
carryover amount from any calendar shall be one-half of the amount by 
which $100,000 exceeds the value at the date of grant of the Common 
Shares for which options were granted to any eligible employee in such 
year.  Unused amounts may be carried forward three years.  Options 
granted in any year shall first use up the $100,000 current year 
limitation and next the unused carryovers in the chronological order of 
the calendar years in which the carryovers arose; and 

         (b)  for incentive stock options granted after December 31, 
1986, the aggregate fair market value

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

(determined at the time the option is granted) of the shares with respect 
to such incentive stock options which are exercisable for the first time 
during any calendar year (under all plans of the Corporation and its 
subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000.


       4.  Shares Subject to the Plan.  The shares subject to the Plan 
shall be the Corporation's Common Shares, $.50 par value, and may be 
authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.  The total number of 
shares that may be delivered upon the exercise of all options granted 
under the Plan may not exceed 1,125,000, subject, however, to adjustment 
as provided in Section 12.  Stock appreciation rights may be granted with 
respect to all or part of the shares subject to an option granted under 
the  Plan.  When all or part of an option is surrendered upon exercise of 
the related stock appreciation rights, the shares subject to the 
surrendered part of the option shall be considered exercised in full and 
shall not be available for the grant of future options under the Plan, 
and the number of shares that may be delivered under the Plan shall be 
reduced accordingly.  When, however, an option is surrendered or expires 
for any reason other than the exercise  of the related stock appreciation 
rights, the shares subject to the option shall again become available for 
offering under the Plan.

                                   - 3 -
<PAGE>

      5.  Option Price.  The option price shall be determined by the 
Committee or by the Board of Directors.  In the case of incentive stock 
options, the option price may not be less than 100% of the fair market 
value of the  shares subject to the option on the date the option is  
granted, except that, if the optionee owns, at the time the option is 
granted, shares possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting 
power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or a subsidiary, the 
option price may be not less than 110% of the fair market value of the 
shares on  the date the option is granted.  In no event may previously 
unissued shares be issued at a price less than that permitted by the Ohio 
General Corporation Law. For purposes of this Plan, the "fair market 
value" of shares on any date  shall be the reported closing price of the 
shares as reported for New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions on 
that date or, if no shares are traded on that date, the next preceding 
date on which trading occurred. In the  event that the shares cease to be 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the "fair market value" of the 
shares shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Committee.

       6.  Exercise of Options.  Except as otherwise  provided in Section 
7, or as may be permitted pursuant to options granted under Section 13, 
an option may be exercised only while the optionee is in the employ of 
the Corporation or of a subsidiary.  Unless an option is accelerated as 

                                    - 4 -
<PAGE>

provided in this Section 6, an optionee to whom an option has been 
granted must remain in the continuous employ of the Corporation or of a 
subsidiary for one year from the date on which the option is granted 
before he or she may exercise any part of the option.  Thereafter, and 
during the life of the option, the option may be exercised at any time 
as to all of the Common Shares subject to the option, or from time to 
time, as to any portion of such Common Shares.  No fraction of a Common 
Share may, however, be purchased upon the exercise of an option.  
Incentive stock options granted after December 31, 1986 may be exercised 
in any order and may be exercised before the exercise of incentive stock 
options granted before January 1, 1987.  No incentive stock option 
granted before January 1, 1987 shall be exercisable while there is 
outstanding any incentive stock option previously granted to the employee 
by the Corporation or by a parent, subsidiary, or predecessor 
corporation.  An option shall be treated as outstanding for this purpose 
until the option is exercised in full, is surrendered upon the exercise 
of related stock appreciation rights, or expires by reason of the lapse 
of time.

           The Board of Directors may, in its discretion and upon such 
terms as it deems appropriate, accelerate the date on which any 
outstanding option becomes exercisable in the event of a proposed merger 
or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another corporation,

another transaction or series of transactions that the Board determines 
is likely to result in a change in control of the Corporation.  In 
addition to the foregoing, the Committee may purchase stock options 
previously granted to any person who is at the time of any such 
transaction a director or officer of the Corporation for a price equal to 
the difference between the consideration per share payable pursuant to 
the terms of the transaction and the option price.

       7.  Exercise of Options After Termination of Employment. No option 
may be exercised after termination of the optionee's employment, except 
in the following situations:

           (a)  If the termination of employment is due to permanent 
disability or to retirement under the applicable retirement plan or 
policy of the Corporation or a subsidiary, the optionee shall have the 
right to exercise the option in whole or in part within the period of two 
years after the date of the termination of his employment.

           (b)  If the termination of employment is due to the death of 
the optionee, the optionee's estate, personal representative, or 
beneficiary shall have the right to exercise the option in whole or in 
part within the period of two years after the date of the optionee's 
death.

                                    - 6 -

<PAGE>

          (c)  If the termination of employment is due to any other 
reason except the optionee's permanent disability or retirement as 
specified in (a) above or the optionee's death as specified in (b) 
above, the optionee shall have the right to exercise the option in whole 
or in part within the period of three months after the date of such 
termination of employment.

       8.  Termination of Options. An option granted under this Plan 
shall terminate, and the right of the employee to purchase shares upon 
exercise of the option shall expire, on the date determined by the 
Committee at the time the option is granted. No option, however, may 
have a life of more than ten years after the date it is granted, and, in 
the case of an employee who owns, at the time the option is granted, 
stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all 
classes of stock of the Corporation or a subsidiary, no incentive stock 
option may have a life of more than five years after the date it is 
granted.  If an option is accelerated pursuant to Section 6, the Board 
may prescribe an earlier termination date.

       9.  Notice of Grant.  When an employee is granted an option under 
the Plan, the Committee shall promptly cause the employee to be notified 
in writing of the nature of the grant and the terms of the option.  The 

                                    - 7 -

<PAGE>

date on which the Committee approves the grant shall be considered to be 
the date on which the option is granted.  

      l0.  Notice of Exercise; Payment for Shares.  An option shall be 
considered to be exercised when the employee notifies the Corporation in 
writing of his intention to do so and tenders payment in full of the 
option price.  Payment of the option price may be made in cash, by 
delivery of Common Shares of the Corporation (taken at their fair market 
value on the date of exercise, as defined in Section 5), or partly in 
cash and partly in shares, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  
The employee shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect 
to shares purchased upon exercise of an option until he has paid the 
option price in full.

     ll. Nontransferrability of Options.  An option granted under the 
Plan may not be transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent 
and distribution.  Each employee to whom an option is granted, by 
accepting the option, agrees with the Corporation that, in the event 
that the Corporation merges into or consolidates with another 
corporation, the Corporation sells all or a substantial part of its 
assets, or the Corporation's Common Shares are subject to a tender or 
exchange offer, he will consent to the transfer or assumption of the 
option, or accept a new option in substitution therefor, if the Committee 
or the Board of Directors requests him to do so.

                                    - 8 -
<PAGE>

     12.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Shares.  In the event of any change 
in the shares subject to the Plan or to any option right granted under 
the Plan by reason of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, 
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, exchange of shares, or 
other change in the corporate structure of the Corporation, the aggregate 
number of Common Shares as to which options may thereafter by granted 
under the Plan, the number of Common Shares subject to each outstanding 
option, and the option price for share subject to each outstanding option 
shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee.

     13.  Substitute Options.  The Board of Directors may grant options 
in substitution for, or upon the assumption of, options granted by 
another corporation that is merged into, consolidated with, or all or a 
substantial part of the assets or stock of which is acquired by the 
Corporation or a subsidiary.  Subject to the limit in Section 4 on the 
number of shares that may be delivered upon the exercise of options 
granted under this Plan, the terms and provisions of any options granted 
under this Section 13 may vary from the terms and provisions otherwise 
specified in this Plan and may, instead, correspond to the terms and 
provisions of the options granted by the other corporation.


     14.  Purchase for Investment.  Each employee receiving shares upon 
exercise of an option may be required 

                                    - 9 -
<PAGE>

by the Corporation to furnish a representation that he is acquiring the 
shares as an investment and not with a view to distribution if the 
Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines that the representation 
is required to ensure that the resale or other disposition of the shares 
would not violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any 
applicable state securities laws.  The Corporation reserves the right to 
place any legend or other symbol on certificates for shares delivered 
pursuant to the Plan, and to issue any stop transfer or similar 
instructions to the transfer agent, that the Corporation deems necessary 
and proper to assure compliance with any such representation.

     15.  Compliance with Securities Laws. No certificate for shares 
shall be delivered upon exercise of an option until the Corporation has 
taken any action that is required to comply with the provisions of the 
Securities  Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended, and any applicable state securities laws and with the 
requirements of any exchange on which the Corporation's Common Shares 
may, at the time, be listed.

     16.  Duration and Termination of the Plan.  The Plan shall remain in 
effect until July 7, 1992, and shall then terminate, unless terminated at 
an earlier date by action of the Board of Directors.  Except as provided 
in Section 18, termination of the Plan shall not affect options 
previously granted.

                                   - 10 -

<PAGE>

     17.  Amendment of the Plan.  The Board of  Directors may alter or 
amend the Plan from time to time prior to its termination, except that, 
without shareholder approval, no amendment may increase the aggregate 
number of shares with respect to which options may be granted (except in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 12), reduce  the option price 
at which options may be exercised (except  in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 12), extend the time within which options may be 
granted or the time  within which an option may be exercised, or change 
the requirements relating to eligibility or to administration of the 
Plan.  Except in accordance with the provisions of Section 12, the Board 
of Directors may not, without the consent of the holder of the option, 
alter or impair any outstanding option previously granted under this 
Plan.  The Committee may, with the agreement of the affected optionee, 
cancel any stock option granted pursuant to the Plan.  In the event of 
such cancellation, the Committee may authorize the grant of a new option 
for the same number of Common Shares specified in the cancelled stock 
option or for a different number of Common Shares, at such option price 
and upon terms and conditions which would have been applicable under the 
Plan had the original cancelled stock option not been granted.

     18.  Effective Date.  This Plan was adopted by the Board of 
Directors and became effective on July 8,

                                    - 11 -

1982, subject to approval by the Corporation's shareholders  on or before 
July 7, 1983.  Options may be granted prior to approval of the Plan by

has been approved by shareholders.  If the shareholders do not approve 
the Plan on or before July 7, 1983, all options previously granted under 
the Plan shall terminate.

              *Numbered in accordance with Item 601 of Regulation S-K.
<PAGE>

                      PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION
                    1987 EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTION PLAN

                       Effective:  January 29, 1987



     1.  Purpose.  This 1987 Employees Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is 
designed to enable the Corporation, by the grant of options, to attract 
and retain key employees for the Corporation and its subsidiaries and to 
provide additional incentive to these employees through increased stock 
ownership.  Options granted under the Plan may be (a) incentive stock 
options within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (b) nonqualified stock options.

     2.  Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by a committee 
consisting of not less than three directors of the Corporation (the 
"Committee"), to be appointed by, and to serve during the pleasure of, the 
Board of Directors of the Corporation.  No director who has within one 
year been eligible to participate in the Plan may be appointed or serve as 
a member of the Committee.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the 
Committee shall have full power and authority to interpret the provisions 
and to supervise the administration of the Plan and to define the terms of 
and grant options under the Plan.  All decisions by the Committee pursuant 
to the provisions of the Plan shall be made by a majority of its members 
and shall be final.


<PAGE>

      3.  Employees Who May Participate in the Plan.  Employees to whom 
options are granted shall be designated from time by the Committee.  An 
option may be granted to any salaried employee of the Corporation or of a 
subsidiary with executive, managerial, technical or professional 
responsibility, including any officer who is a member of the Board of 
Directors.  An employee may hold more than one option; however, for 
incentive stock options, the aggregate fair market value (determined at 
the time the option is granted) of the shares with respect to such 
incentive stock options which are exercisable for the first time during 
any calendar year (under all plans of the Corporation and its 
subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000.

     4.  Shares Subject to the Plan.  The shares subject to the Plan shall 
be the Corporation's Common Shares, without par value, and may be 
authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.  The total number of 
shares that may be delivered upon the exercise of all options granted 
under the Plan may not exceed l,000,000, subject, however. to adjustment 
as provided in Section 12. Stock appreciation rights may be granted with 
respect to all or part of the shares subject to an option granted under 
the Plan.  When all or part of an option is surrendered upon exercise of 
the related stock appreciation rights, the shares subject to the 
surrendered part of the 

                                    - 2 -
<PAGE>

option shall be considered exercised in full and shall not be available 
for the grant of future options under the Plan, and the number of shares 
that may be delivered under the Plan shall be reduced accordingly.  When, 
however, an option is surrendered or expires for any reason other than the 
exercise of the related stock appreciation rights, the shares subject to 
the option shall again become available for offering under the Plan.

     5. Option Price.  The option price shall be determined by the 
Committee or by the Board of Directors. In the case of incentive stock 
options, the option price may not be less than 100% of the fair market 
value of the shares subject to the option on the date the option is 
granted, except that, if the optionee owns, at the time the option is 
granted, shares possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting 
power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or a subsidiary, the 
option price may be not less than 110% of the fair market value of the 
shares on the date the option is granted.  In no event may previously 
unissued shares be issued at a price less than that permitted by the Ohio 
General Corporation Law. For purposes of this Plan, the "fair market 
value" of shares on any date shall be the reported closing price of the 
shares as reported for New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions on 
that date or, if no shares are traced on that date, the 

                                    - 3 -
<PAGE>

next preceding date on which trading occurred.  In the event that the 
shares cease to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the "fair market 
value" of the shares shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the 
Committee.

     6.  Exercise of Options.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 7, 
or as may be permitted pursuant to options granted under Section 13, an 
option may be exercised only while the optionee is in the employ of the 
Corporation or of a subsidiary.  Unless an option is accelerated as 
provided in this Section 6, an optionee to whom an option has been granted 
must remain in the continuous employ of the Corporation or of a subsidiary 
for one year from the date on which the option is granted before he or she 
may exercise any part of the option.  Thereafter, and during the life of 
the option, the option may be exercised at any time as to all of the 
Common Shares subject to the option, or from time to time, as to any 
portion of such Common Shares or in such installments as the Committee may 
determine at the time the option is granted.  No fraction of a Common 
Share may, however, be purchased upon the exercise of an option.  An 
option shall be treated as outstanding for this purpose until the option 
is exercised in full, is surrendered upon the exercise of related stock 
appreciation rights, or expires by reason of the lapse of time.

     The Board of Directors may, in its discretion and upon such terms as 
it deems appropriate, accelerate the 

                                    - 4 -

<PAGE>

date on which any outstanding option becomes exercisable in the event of a 
proposed merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another 
corporation, a proposed sale of all or a substantial part of the 
Corporation's assets, a tender or exchange offer for the Corporation's 
Common Shares, or another transaction or series of transactions that the 
Board determines is likely to result in a change in control of the 
Corporation.  In addition to the foregoing, the Committee may purchase 
stock options previously granted to any person who is at the time of any 
such transaction a director or officer of the Corporation for a price 
equal to the difference between the consideration per share payable 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction and the option price.


     7.  Exercise of Options After Termination of Employment.  No option 
may be exercised after termination of the optionee's employment except in 
the following situations:

         (a)  If the termination of employment is due to permanent 
disability or to retirement under the applicable retirement plan or policy 
of the Corporation or a subsidiary, the optionee shall have the right to 
exercise the option in whole or in part within the period of two years 
after the date of the termination of his employment.

         (b)  If the termination of employment is due to the death of the 
optionee, the optionee's estate, 

                                    - 5 -
<PAGE>

personal representative, or beneficiary shall have the right to exercise 
the option in whole or in part within the period of two years after the 
date of the optionee's death.

         (c)  If the termination of employment is due to any other reason 
except the optionee's permanent disability or retirement as specified in 
(a) above or the optionee's death as specified in (b) above, the optionee 
shall have the right to exercise the option in whole or in part within the 
period of three months after the date of such termination of employment.

     8.  Termination of Options.  An option granted under this Plan shall 
terminate, and the right of the employee to purchase shares upon exercise 
of the option shall expire, on the date determined by the Committee at the 
time the option is granted.  No option, however, may have a life of more 
than ten years after the date it is granted, and, in the case of an 
employee who owns, at the time the option is granted, stock possessing 
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock 
of the Corporation or a subsidiary, no incentive stock option may have a 
life of more than five years after the date it is granted.  If an option 
is accelerated pursuant to Section 6, the Board may prescribe an earlier 
termination date.

     9. Notice of Grant.  When an employee is granted an option under the 
Plan, the Committee shall 

                                    - 6 -

<PAGE>

promptly cause the employee to be notified in writing of the nature of the 
grant and the terms of the option.  The date on which the Committee 
approves the grant shall be considered to be the date on which the option 
is granted.

     10.  Notice of Exercise; Payment for Shares. An option shall be 
considered to be exercised when the employee notifies the Corporation in 
writing of his intention to do so and tenders payment in full of the 
option price.  Payment of the option price may be made in cash, by 
delivery of Common Shares of the Corporation (taken at their fair market 
value on the date of exercise, as defined in Section 5), or partly in cash 
and partly in shares, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  The 
employee shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to 
shares purchased upon exercise of an option until he has paid the option 
price in full.

     11. Nontransferrability of Options.  An option granted under the Plan 
may not be transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and 
distribution. Each employee to whom an option is granted, by accepting the 
option, agrees with the Corporation that, in the event that the 
Corporation merges into or consolidates with another corporation, the 
Corporation sells all or a substantial part of its assets, or the 
Corporation's Common Shares are subject to a tender or exchange offer, he 
will consent to the transfer or assumption of the option, or 

                                    - 7 -

<PAGE>


accept a new option in substitution therefor, if the Committee or the 
Board of Directors requests him to do so.

     12. Adjustments Upon Changes in Shares.  In the event of any change 
in the shares subject to the Plan or to any option right granted under the 
Plan by reason of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, 
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, exchange of shares, or 
other change in the corporate structure of the Corporation, the aggregate 
number of Common Shares as to which options may thereafter be granted 
under the Plan, the number of Common Shares subject to each outstanding 
option, and the option price for shares subject to each outstanding option 
shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee.

     13.  Substitute Options.  The Board of Directors may grant options in 
substitution for, or upon the assumption of, options granted by another 
corporation that is merged into, consolidated with, or all or a 
substantial part of the assets or stock of which is acquired by the 
Corporation or a subsidiary.  Subject to the limit in Section 4 on the 
number of shares that may be delivered upon the exercise of options 
granted under this Plan, the terms and provisions of any options granted 
under this Section 13 may vary from the terms and provisions otherwise 
specified in this Plan and may, instead, correspond to the terms and 
provisions of the options granted by the other corporation.

                                    - 8 -
<PAGE>

     14.  Purchase for Investment.  Each employee receiving shares upon 
exercise of an option may be required by the Corporation to furnish a 
representation that he is acquiring the shares as an investment and not 
with a view to distribution if the Corporation, in its sole discretion, 
determines that the representation is required to ensure that the resale 
or other disposition of the shares would not violate the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, or any applicable state securities laws. The Corporation 
reserves the right to place any legend or other symbol on certificates for 
shares delivered pursuant to the Plan, and to issue any stop transfer or 
similar instructions to the transfer agent, that the Corporation deems 
necessary and proper to assure compliance with any such representation.

     15.  Compliance with Securities Laws.  No certificate for shares 
shall be delivered upon exercise of an option until the Corporation has 
taken any action that is required to comply with the provisions of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended. and any applicable state securities laws and with the 
requirements of any exchange on which the Corporation's Common Shares may, 
at the time, be listed.

     16.  Duration and Termination of the Plan. The Plan shall remain in 
effect until January 28, 1997, and shall then terminate, unless terminated 
at an earlier date 

                                    - 9 -
<PAGE>

by action of the Board of Directors.  Except as provided in Section 18, 
termination of the Plan shall not affect options previously granted.

     17.  Amendment of the Plan.  The Board of Directors may alter or 
amend the Plan from time to time prior to its termination, except that, 
without shareholder approval, no amendment may increase the aggregate 
number of shares with respect to which options may be granted (except in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 12), reduce the option price at 
which options may be exercised (except in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 12), extend the time within which options may be granted or the 
time within which an option may be exercised, or change the requirements 
relating to eligibility or to administration of the Plan.  Except in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 12, the Board of Directors may 
not, without the consent of the holder of the option, alter or impair any 
outstanding option previously granted under this Plan.  The Committee may, 
with the agreement of the affected optionee, cancel any stock option 
granted pursuant to the Plan.  In the event of such cancellation. the 
Committee may authorize the grant of a new option for the same number of 
Common Shares specified in the canceled stock option or for a different 
number of Common Shares, at such option price and upon terms and 
conditions which would have been applicable 

                                    - 10 -

under the Plan had the original cancelled stock option not been granted.

                          1990 EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTION PLAN

                            Effective:  September 1, 1990


      1.    Purpose.    This 1990 Employees Stock Option Plan (the 
"Plan") is designed to enable the Corporation, by the grant of options, to 
attract and retain key employees for the Corporation and its subsidiaries 
and to provide additional incentive to these employees through increased 
stock ownership.  Options granted under the Plan may be (a) incentive stock 
options within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (b) nonqualified stock options.

      2.    Administration.    The Plan shall be administered by a
committee consisting of not less than three directors of the Corporation (the
"Committee"), to be appointed by, and to serve during the pleasure of, the 
Board of Directors of the Corporation.  No director who has within one year 
been eligible to participate in the Plan may be appointed or serve as a 
member of the Committee.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee 
shall have full power and authority to interpret the provisions and to 
supervise the administration of the Plan and to define the terms of and 
grant options under the Plan.  All decisions by the Committee pursuant to 
the provisions of the Plan shall be made by a majority of its members and 
shall be final.

      3.    Employees Who May Participate in the Plan.    Employees to whom
options are granted shall be designated from time to time by the
Committee.  An option may be granted to any salaried employee of the
Corporation or of a subsidiary with executive, managerial, technical or
professional responsibility, including any officer who is a member of the 
Board of Directors.  An employee may hold more than one option; however, 
for incentive stock options, the aggregate fair market value (determined at 
the time the option 

<PAGE>

is granted) of the shares with respect to such incentive stock options which 
are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under all plans 
of the Corporation and its subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000.

      4.    Shares Subject to the Plan.    The shares subject to the Plan 
shall be the Corporation's Common Shares, without par value, and may be 
authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.  The total number of 
shares that may be delivered upon the exercise of all options granted under 
the Plan may not exceed 1,000,000, subject, however, to adjustment as 
provided in Section 12.  Stock appreciation rights may be granted with 
respect to all or part of the shares subject to an option granted under the 
Plan.  When all or part of an option is surrendered upon exercise of the 
related stock appreciation rights, the shares subject to the surrendered 
part of the option shall be considered exercised in full and shall not be 
available for the grant of future options under the Plan, and the number of 
shares that may be delivered under the Plan shall be reduced accordingly.  
When, however, an option is surrendered or expires for any reason other than 
the exercise of the related stock appreciation rights, the shares subject to 
the option shall again become available for offering under the Plan.

      5.    Option Price.    The option price shall be determined by the 
Committee or by the Board of Directors.  In the  case of incentive stock 
options, the option price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value 
of the shares subject to the option on the date the option is granted, except 
that, if the optionee owns, at the time the option is granted, shares 
possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes 
of stock of the Corporation or a subsidiary, the option price may be not 
less than 110% of the fair market value of the shares on the date the option 
is granted.  In no event may previously 

                                   - 2 -
<PAGE>

unissued shares be issued at a price less than that permitted by the Ohio 
General Corporation Law.  For purposes of this Plan,  the "fair market value" 
of shares on any date shall be the reported closing price of the shares as 
reported for New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions on that date, or 
if no shares are traded on that date, the next preceding date on which 
trading occurred.  In the event that the shares cease to be traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange, the "fair market value" of the shares shall be 
determined in the manner prescribed by the Committee.

      6.    Exercise  of  Options.    Except as otherwise provided in Section
7, or as may be permitted pursuant to options granted under Section 13, an 
option may be exercised only while the optionee is in the employ of the 
Corporation or of a subsidiary.  Unless an option is accelerated as provided 
in this Section 6, an optionee to whom an option has been granted must 
remain in the continuous employ of the Corporation or of a subsidiary for 
one year from the date on which the option is granted before he or she may 
exercise any part of the option.  Thereafter, and during the life of the 
option, the option may be exercised at any time as to all of the Common 
Shares subject to the option, or from time to time, as to any portion of 
such Common Shares or in such installments as the Committee may determine at 
the time the option is granted.  No fraction of a Common Share may, however, 
be purchased upon the exercise of an option.  An option shall be treated as 
outstanding for this purpose until the option is exercised in full, is 
surrendered upon the exercise of related stock appreciation rights, or 
expires by reason of the lapse of time.

            The Board of Directors may, in its discretion and upon such 
terms as it deems appropriate, accelerate the date on which any outstanding 
option becomes exercisable in the event of a proposed merger or consolidation 
of the Corporation

                                   - 3 -
<PAGE>

into or with another corporation, a proposed sale of all or a substantial part
of the Corporation's assets, a tender or exchange offer for the Corporation's 
Common  Shares, or another transaction or series of transactions that the
Board determines is likely to result in a change in control of the Corporation.
 In addition to the foregoing, the Committee may purchase stock options
previously granted to any person who is at the time of any such transaction a
director or officer of the Corporation for a price equal to the difference
between the consideration per share payable pursuant to the terms of the
transaction and the option price.

      7.    Exercise of Options After Termination of Employment.    No option 
may be exercised after termination of the optionee's employment, except in the
following situations:

            (a)    If the termination of employment is due to permanent
disability or to retirement under the applicable retirement plan or policy of 
the Corporation or a subsidiary, the optionee shall have the right to 
exercise the option in whole or in part within the period of two years after 
the date of the termination of his employment.

            (b)    If the termination of employment is due to the death of the
optionee, the optionee's estate, personal representative, or beneficiary shall
have the right to exercise the option in whole or in part within the period of
two years after the date of the optionee's death.

            (c)    If the termination of employment is due to any other reason
except the optionee's permanent disability or retirement as specified in (a)
above or the optionee's death as specified in (b) above, the optionee shall 
have the right to exercise the option in whole or in part within the period 
of three months after the date of such termination of employment.

                                   - 4 -
<PAGE>

      8.    Termination of Options.    An option granted under this Plan shall
terminate, and the right of the employee to purchase shares upon exercise of 
the option shall expire, on the date determined by the Committee at the time 
the option is granted.  No option, however, may have a life of more than ten 
years after the date it is granted, and, in the case of an employee who owns, 
at the time the option is granted, stock possessing more than 10% of the 
total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or a
subsidiary, no incentive stock option may have a life of more than five years
after the date it is granted.  If an option is accelerated pursuant to Section
6, the Board may prescribe an earlier termination date.

      9.    Notice of Grant.    When an employee is granted an option under the
Plan, the Committee shall promptly cause the employee to be notified in writing
of the nature of the grant and the terms of the option.  The date on which the
Committee approves the grant shall be considered to be the date on which the
option is granted.

     10.    Notice of Exercise: Payment for Shares.    An option shall be
considered to be exercised when the employee notifies  the  Corporation in
writing of his intention to do so and tenders payment in full of the option
price.  Payment of the option price may be made in cash, by delivery of Common
Shares of the Corporation (taken at their fair market value on the date of
exercise, as defined in Section 5), or partly in cash and partly in shares,
unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  The employee shall have none of
the rights of a shareholder with respect to shares purchased upon exercise of 
an option until he has paid the option price in full.

     11.    Nontransferability of Options.  An option granted under the Plan 
may not be transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and 
distribution. 

                                   - 5 -
<PAGE>

Each employee to whom an option is granted, by accepting the option, agrees 
with the Corporation that, in the event that the Corporation merges into or
consolidates with another corporation, the Corporation sells all or a
substantial part of its assets, or the Corporation's Common Shares are subject
to a tender or exchange offer, he will consent to the transfer or assumption of
the option, or accept a new option in substitution therefor, if the Committee 
or the Board of Directors requests him to do so.

     12.    Adjustments Upon Changes in Shares.    In the event of any change 
in the shares subject to the Plan or to any option right granted under the 
Plan by reason of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, 
stock dividend, stock split, exchange of shares, or other change in the 
corporate structure of the Corporation, the aggregate number of Common Shares 
as to which options may thereafter be granted under the Plan, the number of 
Common Shares subject to each outstanding option, and the option price for 
shares subject to each outstanding option shall be appropriately adjusted by
the Committee.

     13.    Substitute Options.    The Board of Directors may grant options
in substitution for, or upon the assumption of, options granted by another
corporation that is merged into, consolidated with, or all or a substantial
part of the assets or stock of which is acquired by the Corporation
or a subsidiary.  Subject to the limit in Section 4 on the number of shares 
that may be delivered upon the exercise of options granted under this Plan, 
the terms and provisions of any options granted under this Section 13 may 
vary from the terms and provisions otherwise specified in this Plan and may,
instead, correspond to the terms and provisions of the options granted by 
the other corporation.

                                   - 6 -
<PAGE>

     14.    Purchase for Investment.    Each employee receiving shares upon
exercise of an option may be required by the Corporation to furnish a
representation that he is acquiring the shares as an investment and not with 
a view to distribution if the Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines 
that the representation is required to ensure that the resale or other
disposition of the shares would not violate the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or any applicable state securities laws.  The Corporation reserves 
the right to place any legend or other symbol on certificates for shares 
delivered pursuant to the Plan, and to issue any stop transfer or similar 
instructions to the transfer agent, that the Corporation deems necessary 
and proper to assure compliance with any such representation.

     15.    Compliance with Securities Law.    No certificate for shares 
shall be delivered upon exercise of an option until the Corporation has 
taken any action that is required to comply with the provisions of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended, and any applicable state securities laws and with the requirements
of any exchange on which the Corporation's Common Shares may, at the time, 
be listed.

     16.    Duration and Termination of the Plan.    The Plan shall remain in
effect until August 31, 2000, and shall then terminate, unless terminated at 
an earlier date by action of the Board of Directors.  Except as provided in 
Section 18, termination of the Plan shall not affect options previously 
granted.

     17.    Amendment of the Plan.    The Board of Directors may alter or 
amend the Plan from time to time prior to its termination, except that, 
without shareholder approval, no amendment may increase the aggregate number 
of shares with respect to which options may be granted (except in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 12), reduce the option price at which options 
may be

                                   - 7 -
<PAGE>

exercised (except in accordance with the provisions of Section 12), extend the
time within which options may be granted or the time within which an option may
be exercised, or change the requirements relating to eligibility or to
administration of the Plan.  Except in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 12, the Board of Directors may not, without the consent of the holder 
of the option, alter or impair any outstanding options previously granted 
under this Plan.  The Committee, may, with the agreement of the affected 
optionee, cancel any stock option granted pursuant to the Plan.  In the event 
of such cancellation, the Committee may authorize the grant of a new option 
for the same number of Common Shares specified in the cancelled stock option 
or for a different number of Common Shares, at such option price and upon 
terms and conditions which would have been applicable under the Plan had the 
original cancelled stock option not been granted.

     18.    Effective Date.    This Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors
and became effective on September 1, 1990, subject to approval by the
Corporation's shareholders on or before October 24, 1990.  Options may be 
granted prior to approval of the Plan by shareholders, but no such option may 
be exercised until after the Plan has been approved by shareholders.  If the
shareholders do not approve the Plan on or before October 24, 1990, all 
options previously granted under the Plan shall terminate.


Approved by the Shareholders on October 24, 1990.

                             PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION
                                     1995-96-97
                              LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN


The purpose of the Plan is to provide a long-term incentive portion of bonus
compensation.  The plan's focus is on return on equity.  It balances a 
competitive base salary pay structure, an annual cash bonus compensation based 
on a return on average assets, and a stock option plan with ten-year exercise 
rights.  The return on equity objective is a key financial goal and 
comprehends return on sales at the net income level and asset utilization.  

The participants in this plan in the near term will be limited to Corporate 
Officers and Group Presidents.  They clearly can affect broadly the overall 
financial performance of the company.  At a later date, it could be expanded 
to include Operating Vice Presidents and equivalent Corporate Staff positions.

The key elements of Parker-Hannifin's plan are as follows:


Participation
Those key executives having a critical impact on the long term performance of 
the Company selected by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the 
Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board.

Performance Period
Three-year average Return on Equity with the grant to cover FY 95, 96 and 97.

Size of Awards
Commensurate with bonus compensation and stock option level of participants as
determined by the CEO with approval of the Compensation and Management 
Development Committee.

Performance Objective
The Return on Equity objective is 14%.

Value Range
Actual value of the payments under the Plan will be within a range of 25% to 
200% of target value based on performance against the objective.

Performance Range
For performance below a threshold of 8% ROE objective, no payment will be 
made.  For performance between 8% and 20% ROE, payments will be earned between 
25% and 200% of the target value on a proportional basis above and below the 
target value.  The plan is capped at 200%.

Payment
Payments earned under the plan will be paid at the end of the three-year 
performance period.  Payment will be made in restricted stock of the 
Corporation unless the participant elects a cash payment to be deferred under 
the Corporation's voluntary income deferral plan.  The restricted shares would 
be subject to a vesting schedule and such other terms and conditions 
determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of issuance.  Any payout 
pursuant to this plan that will result in the exceedance of the $1 million cap 
on the tax deductibility of executive compensation will be deferred until such 
time in the earliest subsequent fiscal year that such cap will not be 
<PAGE>

exceeded.

Termination of Employment
If a participant dies, retires (with consent of the Compensation and 
Management Development Committee if earlier than age 60) or is disabled during 
the performance period, he will receive a pro rata portion of the award 
payable upon completion of the performance period.  A participant who resigns 
or is otherwise terminated during the performance period forfeits the award.

Performance Schedule
The Plan performance schedule, based on the three year simple average of 
annual report Return on Equity, is as follows:

DISCUSSION OF STATEMENT OF INCOME

The Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes Parker's operating 
performance over the last three years.  During this period the Company 
reorganized extensively to respond to market changes.  The North American 
Industrial markets experienced a strong recovery during the latter half of 
fiscal 1993 and all of fiscal 1994.  The reorganization of prior years 
helped these operations prepare for this growth and for margin 
improvement.  Recessions in Europe and Latin America caused volume 
declines in the International Industrial markets during these years which 
led to significant reorganization and downsizing.  In late fiscal 1994 
these markets also began to show signs of recovery which the Company 
believes could be as strong as in North America.  The commercial airline 
and military aerospace markets have also experienced significant declines 
in all three years, causing significant reorganization and downsizing, as 
well as the impairment of certain long-term assets.  The declines in these 
markets continue to be a concern, but the Aerospace Segment has 
reorganized itself to maintain very good margins in spite of market 
conditions.

  In analyzing the results, it should be noted that 1994 included the effect 
of an extraordinary charge for the early-retirement of debt which is 
explained in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The 1993 
results include the effect of a 13th month for the International 
operations, to bring the year-end of those operations to June 30, 
explained in Note 1.  Also, the 1992 results include the effects of two 
accounting changes, explained in Note 1.

  Net Sales of $2.58 billion for fiscal 1994 were 3.5 percent higher than 
$2.49 billion in 1993.  Without the additional month in 1993 for 
International, the 1994 increase would have been 5.7 percent.  Fiscal 1993 
sales increased 4.8 percent from $2.38 billion in 1992.  North American 
Industrial operations experienced continued strong demand in the heavy-
duty truck, construction and farm equipment, and machine-tool industries.  
In addition, these operations captured additional market share from 
competitors that have not been able to meet customer demands.  However, 
the continuing recession in the International markets and the continuing 
slump in the commercial airline industry, as well as lower spending for 
military aircraft, partially offset these record-setting results.  
Increased volume of the North American Industrial operations is

anticipated to continue and current order trends indicate that 
International operations are showing signs of recovery.  On the other 
hand, Aerospace markets are expected to continue to decline into 1995, 
with recovery anticipated in 1996.  With a presence on virtually every 
significant current commercial and military aircraft program, any 
improvements in aerospace markets should benefit Parker.

   Net income for 1994 was 26.8 percent lower than 1993.  Without the 
additional month of operating results in 1993, the decline would have been 
25.5 percent.  Income for 1994 was reduced by $56.5 million, primarily for 
the reduction in book value of certain long-term assets, downsizing and 
relocation activities, compared to $14.7 million and $10.3 million for 
downsizing and relocations in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Without these 
charges the Industrial operations achieved a significant increase in 
earnings, as a result of higher volume and reduced losses by International 
operations.

  Net income for 1993 increased more than five times over 1992 primarily 
due to the one-time adjustments in 1992 for the cumulative effects of 
changes in two accounting principles described in Note 1 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  Income before the effect of these 
changes increased 2.5 percent in 1993, primarily as a result of the North 
American Industrial operations achieving improved earnings in spite of 
competitive pressures.

   Extraordinary item - extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million in 1994 is 
due to the redemption premiums and deferred issuance costs related to the 
early-retirement of $100.0 million of 9.45 percent debentures and $3.5 
million of Australian long-term bearer bonds.  See Note 7 for further 
description.

  Income before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of changes in 
accounting principles as a percentage of sales was 2.0 percent in 1994, 
down from 2.6 percent in 1993 and 2.7 percent in 1992.  A summary of the 
changes follows:

  Gross profit margin increased to 20.3 percent in 1994 from 19.4 percent 
in 1993 and 18.9 percent in 1992.  Increased production levels in North 
American Industrial operations provided increased margins and better 
absorption of fixed costs.  Also, the benefits of restructuring activities 
are being realized in the margin returns and are expected to benefit 
future years as well.

  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 
decreased to 11.7 percent, from 12.5 percent in 1993 and 11.9 percent in 
1992.  Increased sales volume and efficiencies as a result of 
reorganizations have contributed to the improvements in 1994.  The 
increase in 1993 was primarily a result of increased selling and 
promotional efforts to penetrate new markets and to maintain market share 
in growing domestic markets, as well as to keep market share in some 
extremely competitive shrinking markets.

  Provision for business restructuring activities is the result of 
continued actions aimed at reducing costs and has included downsizing, 
plant closings and relocations, and write-offs of related capital assets.  
Severance costs have been $38.9 million for the three years.  All of the 
actions taken are expected to result in reduced overhead charges in the 
future.

  The Industrial Segment, over the past three years, has incurred 
restructuring charges of $12.3 million, $13.6 million and $11.0 million, 
respectively.  The North American Industrial operations incurred 
restructuring charges of $5.4 million in 1994, which primarily involved 
the relocation or consolidation of higher-cost and under-utilized 
facilities.  Severance charges of $1.2 million were recorded for the 
reduction of 51 employees in 1994 and the planned reduction of 107 
employees in 1995.  Savings as a result of these actions are estimated to 
be $.8 million in 1995 and an additional $1.4 in 1996.  Net cash outflow 
from these actions is estimated to be $2.6 million in 1995 and $.9 million 
in 1996.  International's restructuring charges of $6.9 million in 1994 
were primarily for severance costs for 159 employees (106 employees in 
1994 and the remainder in 1995) and the consolidation of under-utilized 
facilities.  Savings from these actions are anticipated to be $1.8 million 
in 1995 and an additional $1.2 million in 1996.  Net cash outflow is 
estimated to be $2.0 million in fiscal 1995 and $.2 in 1996.

  The Aerospace operations incurred restructuring costs of $6.5 million in 
1994, compared to $9.3 million in 1993 and $3.8 million in 1992.  
Management continues to adjust to the changing market by reducing factory 
and office floor space and organizing into customer-focused teams to more 
effectively serve the customer.  These charges included a workforce 
reduction of 597 employees (296 in 1994 and 301 in 1995) and relocation 
costs for three facilities which will result in lower costs and enhanced 
capacity utilization in 1995.  The savings from these actions are 
estimated to be $3.8 million in 1995 and an additional $4.4 million in 
1996.  Net cash outflow is estimated to be $2.4 million in 1995 and $1.2 
million in 1996.

  Impairment of long-term operating assets of $35.5 million in 1994 
includes $28.9 million related to the write-down of goodwill and certain 
permanently impaired assets of the continuing operations of the Aerospace 
heat-transfer components product line.  This product line was purchased 
during a period of heavy defense spending in 1987 and the related goodwill 
was being amortized over 40 years.  However, with the completion of major 
contracts and the decline of aerospace markets, future cash flows are now 
estimated to be less than the carrying value of the related assets.  
Accordingly, the assets were written down to their recoverable value.  
While the effect of this charge will have no cash impact, it will reduce 
amortization and depreciation expenses $1.6 million per year.  The 
remaining impairment charges relate primarily to certain machinery and 
equipment used in operations in unprofitable product lines in Brazil and 
Germany.  Since the future cash flows of these product lines were 
anticipated to be less than the carrying value of the related assets, the 
machinery and equipment for these product lines were written down to their 
estimated recoverable value.  The effect of these charges will have no 
cash impact but will reduce depreciation expense $.7 million per year in 
1995 and 1996.

  Interest expense decreased by $9.2 million in 1994 and by $5.1 million 
in 1993 principally due to reductions in debt.

  Loss on disposal of assets was $19.6 million in 1994, $14.7 million of 
which was due to impairment of idle properties.  These properties became 
idle due to downsizing activities.  Management has decided to sell or 
lease these properties in the near term.  Accordingly, the assets were 
written-down to their estimated recoverable value based on today's 
markets.  The 1994 loss on disposal of assets was also affected by a 
charge of $1.3 million for the estimated net loss on the sale of the Metal 
Bellows operations.  The 1993 loss on disposal was comparable to 1992.  
All years reported include losses from fixed asset disposals not part of a 
plant closing.  Losses on the disposal of assets from a plant closing are 
included in the Provision for business restructuring activities.

  Income taxes increased to an effective rate of 53.6 percent in 1994 from 
a rate of 39.8 percent in 1993 and 1992.  This increase was primarily due 
to receiving no federal or state tax benefit for the charge taken to write 
down goodwill, and for tax rate changes enacted in the United States and 
Germany.


DISCUSSION OF BALANCE SHEET

The Consolidated Balance Sheet shows the Company's financial position at 
year end, compared with the previous year end.  This statement provides 
information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity 
and financial resources.

  The current ratio at June 30, 1994 was lower than the ratio at June 30, 
1993, principally due to the decrease of cash and cash equivalents.

  Accounts receivable are primarily due from customers for sales of 
product ($347.4 million at June 30, 1994, compared to $316.3 million at 
June 30, 1993).  The current year increase is primarily due to increased 
sales volume, but also increased slightly due to acquisitions.  These 
increases were offset by the effects of currency rate changes in 
hyperinflationary countries.  Lower sales volume in the Aerospace business 
offset the increased sales volume in the North American Industrial 
operations.  Days sales outstanding for the Company improved from 1993.

  Inventories were $492.9 million at June 30, 1994, compared to $499.7 
million a year ago.  Reduced Aerospace inventories were nearly offset by 
increases in the Industrial Segment inventories, reflecting volume changes 
in these segments.  Months supply of inventory on hand at June 30, 1994 
decreased from 1993.

  Accounts payable, trade increased $56.0 million in 1994 primarily within 
the Industrial operations.  The majority of the increase is due to higher 
volume within the North American Industrial operations and current year 
acquisitions.  The Aerospace accounts payable, trade remained constant 
with the prior year.

  Accrued domestic and foreign taxes increased $16.7 million in 1994 as a 
result of the increase in domestic taxable income during the current year 
and the increase in the Federal income tax rate.

  Other accrued liabilities increased $17.3 million in 1994 as a result of 
an increase in accrued  pension liabilities and an increase in accruals 
related to restructuring activities.

  Notes payable and Long-term debt decreased a total of $180.9 million 
primarily due to the retirement of $100 million of 9.45 percent debentures 
due 1997 through 2016, the  retirement of $35.1 million of foreign bearer 
bonds due in 1994 and a reduction of the ESOP debt guarantee by $11.1 
million.

  Pensions and other postretirement benefits increased $11.6 million to 
$169.1 million in 1994.  These costs are explained further in Note 9 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Deferred income taxes included in current assets increased by $12.6 
million due largely to the downsizing and relocation charges taken in the 
current year that are not deductible for income tax purposes until paid.  


                               Page 13-5
<PAGE>
Non-current deferred income tax assets increased $13.8 million in Germany 
for the funding of a portion of their pension obligation, and for a change 
in the tax accounting for inventory.  Non-current deferred income tax 
liabilities decreased $9.3 million, primarily because of reductions in the 
book/tax basis difference of depreciable assets and the tax benefit on the 
increase in the liabilities for other postretirement benefits.  

  At June 30, 1994, non-current deferred income tax assets include a $22.8 
million tax benefit for the net operating loss carryforwards of the 
Company's German operations.  The Company has not provided a valuation 
allowance that would be required under Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 109 if it is more likely that these benefits would 
not be realized.  Although future events cannot be predicted with 
certainty, management believes these benefits will be realized because: 
the tax loss carryforward period is unlimited; there are several tax 
planning strategies that can be used to reduce the carryforward; and the 
Company expects its German operations to return to their pre-1991 
profitability levels within the near future, because 26 percent of the 
recent losses were due to non-recurring restructuring charges and the 
remainder was primarily the result of the recession in Europe.

  It is the Company's goal to maintain no less than an "A" rating on 
senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds.  
To meet this objective, the Company has established the financial goal of 
maintaining a ratio of debt to debt-equity of 30 to 33 percent.  The 
calculation of the debt to debt-equity ratio at June 30, 1994 and 1993 
includes the Company's loan guarantee to the trust established by the 
Company for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan as described more fully in 
Note 7.  Excluding the effect of the loan guarantee on both Long-term debt 
and Shareholders' equity, the debt to debt-equity ratio at June 30, 1994 
and 1993 was 20.7 percent and 30.6 percent, respectively.

  The Company has negotiated a principal revolving credit agreement with 
several banks under which it may borrow up to $50 million.  Upon agreement 
with the banks, this may be increased to $200 million and is intended to 
support financing for worldwide operating needs as well as any commercial 
paper borrowings.  At June 30, 1994, $.7 million was outstanding on this 
credit line.  There are also other lines of credit with various foreign 
banks (with credit limits totaling $55 million) which provide short-term 
financing for the Company's operations overseas.  At June 30, 1994, $11 
million was outstanding from these credit lines.  The Company is also 
currently authorized by the Board of Directors to sell up to $200 million 
of commercial paper notes.  At June 30, 1994, there were no commercial 
paper notes outstanding.


                               Page 13-6
<PAGE>
  In fiscal 1995, no additional borrowings are anticipated to be used for 
the stock repurchase program, capital investments, or working capital 
purposes, but may be utilized for acquisitions.


DISCUSSION OF CASH FLOWS

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and 
outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.  
Related noncash investing and financing transactions that affect the 
Company's financial position, but do not directly affect cash flows during 
the period, are disclosed separately in Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

  Cash and cash equivalents decreased $78.4 million in 1994; but increased 
$59.9 million in 1993.  The major components of these changes in cash 
flows are as follows:

  Cash Flows From Operating Activities -- The Company's largest source of 
cash continues to be net cash provided by operating activities.  The 
charge for the impairment of long-term assets ($52.4 million) does not 
require the use of cash and therefore is a reconciling item added to Net 
income.  Changes in the principal working capital items--Accounts 
receivable, Inventories and Accounts payable, trade--contributed $24.4 
million in 1994, $19.4 million in 1993 and $50.8 million in 1992.  
Increased Accounts receivable in 1994 were more than offset by increased 
Accounts payable, trade.  Inventory reductions have provided cash for the 
last three years, but not as significantly in the current year as in the 
past.  

  Cash Flows From Investing Activities -- Capital expenditures are a 
principal use of long-term funds and have averaged $92.1 million per year 
for the 1992-1994 period.  Capital expenditures increased slightly to 
$99.9 million in 1994 and are expected to increase again in 1995.  
Financing is expected to come from internally generated cash flows.  
Proceeds from dispositions of business provided $13.7 million cash in 1994.

  Cash used for Acquisitions was $39.4 million in 1994 and $35.6 million in 
1993.  Acquisition amounts shown represent the net assets of the acquired 
companies at their respective acquisition dates and consist of the 
following:

    Cash Flows From Financing Activities -- In 1994 the Company reduced 
its outstanding borrowings by a net total of $172.3 million.  Payments of 
long-term borrowings were primarily the early-retirement of $100.0 million 
of debentures, the retirement of $35.1 million in foreign bearer bonds and 
the elimination of certain foreign bank loans.  In 1993 the Company's 
notes payable and long-term borrowings activity remained fairly steady, 
resulting in net proceeds of $3.2 million.    

  Dividends have been paid for 176 consecutive quarters, including a 
yearly increase in dividends for the last 38 fiscal years.  The current 
annual dividend rate is $1.00 per share.

  In summary, based upon the Company's past performance and current 
expectations, management believes that the cash flows generated from 
future operating activities, combined with the Company's worldwide 
financial capabilities, will provide adequate funds to support planned 
growth and continued improvements in Parker's manufacturing facilities and 
equipment.


DISCUSSION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Business Segment Information presents sales, operating income and 
assets by the principal industries and geographic areas in which Parker's 
various businesses operate.  The Industrial Segment results for 1993 
include the effect of a 13th month for the International operations.  See 
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Industrial Segment operating income as a percent of sales increased to 
9.2 percent in 1994 from 7.2 percent in 1993 and 7.0 percent in 1992.  
Return on average assets was 14.0 percent in 1994, 10.6 percent in 1993 
and 9.5 percent in 1992.

  Sales for the North American operations increased 15.5 percent over 
1993, while sales for the International operations declined 6.9 percent.  
Without the effect of the extra month for International operations in 
1993, sales for International would have increased 2.3 percent in 1994.  
North American Industrial sales achieved record levels through increased 
shipments to heavy-duty truck, construction and farm equipment, and 
machine-tool customers.  International Industrial sales continued to be 
affected by the recession in Europe and Latin America and were reduced by 
the effects of currency rate changes.  Sales for 1993, without the effect 
of the extra month for International operations, increased 6.5 percent over 
1992.  North American sales increased 10.3 percent while International sales
decreased 1.6 percent.  The North American markets began experiencing 
increased volume during 1992 which continued throughout 1993.  As in 1994 
the recession lowered volume for the International operations.  Backlog 
was $318.8 million at June 30, 1994, compared to $245.5 million at the end 
of the prior period, primarily due to increases in North America.

  Operating income for the total segment increased 38.8 percent in 1994.  
North American operations improved 33.4 percent, while operating losses 
for the International operations, without the effect of the extra month of 
operations in 1993, were reduced by 16.0 percent.  Total segment Operating 
income for 1993, without the effect of an extra month for International 
operations, increased 13.8 percent, with North America experiencing a 29.5 
percent increase, offset by a significant decline in the International 
operations.  The significant improvements in both years, for the North 
American operations, were due to volume gains which increased capacity 
utilization and therefore improved the absorption of fixed costs.  These 
gains were offset by a continuing recession in the International 
operations which caused under-absorption of fixed costs as a result of 
reduced volume.  In addition, the International operations recognized the 
impairment of long-term assets ($6.6 million pretax), primarily relating 
to certain machinery and equipment used in operations for unprofitable 
product lines in Brazil and Germany.  Despite these charges, the 
International results improved in 1994 and the total segment experienced 
margin improvements as a result of prior years' restructuring activities.

  Assets for the Industrial segment increased 8.0 percent in 1994 and 
increased only slightly in 1993.  The 1994 increase is primarily due to 
increased customer accounts receivable and inventories as a result of 
increased volume in the North American Industrial markets and acquisitions 
in both North America and International.  Net plant and equipment 
increased due to capital expenditures exceeding depreciation as well as 
acquisitions, but these increases were offset by write-downs of impaired 
assets.  Acquisitions also caused an increase in goodwill.  Deferred taxes 
increased for the tax benefits of partially funding the pension obligation 
and an inventory tax accounting change in Germany.  The slight increase in 
assets in 1993 was due to increases in short-term investments, customer 
receivables, and deferred taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the 
inventory balance as a result of currency rate changes.  The increase in 
customer receivables was due to increased volume in North America and the 


                               Page 13-9
<PAGE>
increase in deferred tax assets was caused by the tax benefits of 
increased operating loss carryforwards in Germany.  The increase in short-
term investments was principally due to the International operations' 
investment of cash generated by their operating activities. 

  Aerospace Segment operating income as a percent of sales decreased to 
3.3 percent from 8.5 percent in 1993 and 10.2 percent in 1992.  Return on 
average assets was 4.4 percent in 1994, 10.7 percent in 1993 and 12.1 
percent in 1992.

  Sales decreased 12.1 percent in 1994, and 5.9 percent in 1993, 
reflecting cutbacks in defense and commercial aircraft deliveries. The 
divestiture of the Metal Bellows operations also contributed to the 1994 
decline.  The Aerospace segment has continued to increase its penetration 
of commercial markets, with results approaching a split of nearly 60/40 
between commercial and military revenues.  Backlog at June 30, 1994 was 
$533.7 million as compared to $611.1 million at the end of the prior 
period, reflecting decreased military spending, fewer new aircraft 
deliveries and lower aftermarket volume.  

  Operating income decreased 66.1 percent in 1994 and 21.3 percent in 
1993.  The significant decrease in 1994 is due to the recognition of 
impairment losses of $28.9 million pretax in the third quarter related to 
the write-down of goodwill and permanently impaired assets of the 
continuing operations of the heat-transfer components product line.  The 
decline experienced in 1994 was also due to under-absorption of fixed 
costs as a result of reduced volume, offset by gains that are being 
realized as a result of prior years' restructurings.  The 1993 decline was 
due to higher restructuring costs than the prior year.  

  Assets decreased 23.5 percent in 1994 and 13.4 percent in 1993, 
primarily due to reductions in customer receivables, inventories and net 
plant and equipment, and in 1994 the write-down of goodwill related to 
impaired assets and the divestiture of the Metal Bellows operations.  The 
decrease in customer receivables and inventories are both the result of 
the lower volume experienced during the respective years.  Inventories in 
1993 were also affected by write-offs of excess and obsolete materials.  
Net plant and equipment decreased as a result of downsizing and 
consolidation of facilities as well as from write-downs of impaired assets 
in 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts.)


1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below.

   Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements 
include the accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  All 
material intercompany transactions and profits have been eliminated in 
the consolidated financial statements.

   Financial Instruments - The Company has provided fair value estimates 
and information about valuation methodologies of financial instruments 
in this note and Note 7 to the financial statements.  The Company's 
financial instruments consist primarily of investments in cash, cash 
equivalents and long-term investments as well as obligations under notes 
payable and long-term debt.

   Cash - Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid 
investments, with a three month or less maturity, carried at cost plus 
accrued interest, which are readily convertible into cash.  The carrying 
value for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.

                                             1994       1993       1992
Cash paid for:
Interest, net of capitalized interest    $ 34,221   $ 42,905   $ 46,974
Income taxes                               71,375     39,148     49,190
Noncash financing activities:
Principal reduction of
   ESOP debt guarantee                     11,067     10,003      9,016

   Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  
The majority of domestic inventories are valued by the last-in, first-
out method and the balance of the Company's inventories are valued by 
the first-in, first-out method.

   Long-Term Contracts - The Company enters into long-term contracts for 
the production of products.  For financial statement purposes, sales are 
recorded as deliveries are made (units of delivery method of percentage-
of-completion).  Unbilled costs on these contracts are included in 
inventory.  Progress payments are netted against the inventory balances.  
Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the 
period in which such losses are determined.

   Plant, Equipment and Depreciation - Plant and equipment are recorded 
at cost and are depreciated principally using the straight-line method 
for financial reporting purposes.  Depreciation rates are based on 

                               Page 13-19
<PAGE>

estimated useful lives of the assets.  Improvements which extend the 
useful life of property are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are 
expensed.  When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost 
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the appropriate accounts 
and any gain or loss is included in current income.

   Investments and Other Assets - Investments in joint-venture companies 
in which ownership is 50% or less are stated at cost plus the Company's 
equity in undistributed earnings.  These investments and the related 
earnings are not material to the consolidated financial statements.  The 
carrying value of Investments and other assets approximates fair value.

   Excess Cost of Investments - The excess cost of investments over net 
assets acquired is being amortized, on a straight-line basis, over 
various periods not exceeding 40 years.  Unamortized cost in excess of 
associated expected operating cash flows is considered to be impaired 
and is written down to fair value.

   Income Taxes - Income taxes are provided based upon income for 
financial reporting purposes.  Deferred income taxes arise from 
temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax 
purposes.  Tax credits and similar tax incentives are applied to reduce 
the provision for income taxes in the year in which the credits arise.  
Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reinvested in their 
operations.  Accordingly, no provision is made for additional income 
taxes that might be payable on the distribution of such earnings.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

   Concurrent Close - In fiscal 1993 the Company changed the end of the 
twelve-month reporting period for subsidiaries outside of North America 
from May 31 to June 30 to provide uniform reporting on a global basis.  
Accordingly, an additional month of operating results (June 1993) for 
these subsidiaries is included in the fiscal 1993 financial statements.  
The results of this month for the affected subsidiaries were Net sales 
of $40,089, Income (loss) from operations of $(1,191), Interest expense 
of $1,122 and a Net income (loss) of $(1,484) or $(.03) per share.  For 
fiscal years 1992 and prior, the consolidated financial statements for 
subsidiaries outside of North America were consolidated on the basis of 
twelve-month periods ending May 31 and have not been restated.

   When comparing fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1993 the additional month of 
operating results for these subsidiaries would be June 1992.  The 
results of this month were Net sales of $50,801, Income from operations 
of $2,263, Interest expense of $470 and Net income of $1,057 or $.02 per 
share.

<PAGE>
   Accounting for Postretirement Benefits and Accounting for Income 
Taxes - Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted the provisions of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions and SFAS 
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  For postretirement benefits, the 
Company changed its method from expensing the cost of medical and life 
insurance claims when they are paid to accruing these costs during the 
employees' active working career.  For income taxes, the Company changed 
its method from the deferred method to the asset and liability method.  
Under this method, deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary 
differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of 
the Company's assets and liabilities.  These deferred taxes are measured 
by the provisions of currently enacted tax laws. 

   Effects of SFAS No. 106 and 109 Accounting Changes - The cumulative 
effects for these changes in accounting, for the periods prior to July 
1, 1991, are shown separately in fiscal 1992.  For postretirement 
benefits, the cumulative effect was expense of $60,619 (after an income 
tax benefit of $35,602).  For income taxes, the cumulative effect was 
income of $8,358, consisting of a $1,847 income tax benefit and $6,511 
that was accounted for as an increase in Plant and equipment for prior 
business combinations.  

2.   ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Acquisitions - In August 1994, the Company acquired the Automation 
Division of Atlas Copco AB, a manufacturer of pneumatic components in 
Sweden.  Sales for the most recent fiscal year prior to acquisition 
exceeded $35 million for this operation.

   In April 1994 the Company purchased the assets of a leading 
Scandinavian filter manufacturer, Finn-Filter Oy, for $9.6 million cash, 
which included manufacturing locations in Urjala and Hyrynsalmi, Finland 
and a sales subsidiary in Sweden.  In December 1993 the Company 
increased its ownership in LDI Pneutronics Corp., which specializes in 
advanced-technology pneumatic valves and components for medical, 
semiconductor, and analytical instrumentation markets, from 40 percent 
to 100 percent, for an additional investment of $5.7 million.  In 
November 1993 the Company acquired the Electro-pneumatic Division of 
Telemecanique in Evreux, France, a leading European manufacturer of 
pneumatic products for industrial applications for $26.7 million cash.  
Sales for these operations for their most recent fiscal year prior to 
acquisition exceeded $63.2 million.  These acquisitions were accounted 
for by the purchase method.

   During the year ended June 30, 1993, the Company acquired the Ross 
hydraulic motor and hydrostatic steering controls business of TRW Inc. 
located in Greeneville, Tennessee and Dusseldorf, Germany for 
approximately $31.3 million cash.  Sales for these operations for the 
most recent fiscal year prior to acquisition exceeded $39 million.  This 
acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method.

                               Page 13-21
<PAGE>
   During fiscal 1992, the Company acquired the assets of the hydraulic 
hose business of Trelleborg AB located in Hoogezand, the Netherlands and 
Sundsvall, Sweden for $8.0 million cash and the assets of FACOA, C.A. of 
Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, a manufacturer of hydraulic hose fittings, for 
$1.1 million cash.  Sales for these operations for the most recent 
fiscal year prior to acquisition were approximately $14.5 million.  
These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method.

   Divestitures - Effective April 1, 1994, the Company divested nearly 
all of the assets related to its Metal Bellows operations, which 
manufactured welded and formed bellows, accumulators and other 
fabricated assemblies, principally for the aerospace market.  The sale 
resulted in proceeds of $14.2 million.  Sales for this product line, for 
the most recent fiscal year, were approximately $30 million.

   In December 1992, the Company purchased the assets of Gromelle S.A., 
a manufacturer of hydraulic and pneumatic quick couplings in Annemasse, 
France.  In August 1993, a French Court of Appeals rescinded the 
purchase and on September 1 control of the operations was returned to an 
administrator.  On November 9, 1993 the Court of Appeals accepted a 
purchase proposal submitted by another party and ordered the return of 
the purchase price to the Company.  The effects of this transaction are 
not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements and were 
reported as a disposition of business in fiscal 1994.

3.  INCOME TAXES

Income taxes before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of changes 
in accounting principles include the following:

                                             1994       1993       1992

   Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences 
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities.  The differences comprising the net deferred taxes shown on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30 were as follows:

                                                        1994       1993
Postretirement benefits                             $ 45,051   $ 33,425
Other liabilities and reserves                        39,358     28,656
Long-term contracts                                    8,944      9,648
Operating loss carryforwards                          38,403     39,036
Foreign tax credit carryforwards                       3,093      1,263
Valuation allowance                                  (11,035)    (9,078)
Depreciation                                         (57,848)   (63,986)
Acquisitions                                          (7,584)   (11,420)
Inventory                                              4,048     (1,040)
Net deferred tax asset (liability)                  $ 62,430   $ 26,504

Change in net deferred tax asset (liability):
    Provision for deferred tax                      $ 34,438   $ 14,923
    Translation adjustment                             1,978       (299)
    Acquisitions                                        (490)
Total change in net deferred tax                    $ 35,926   $ 14,624

   At June 30, 1994, foreign subsidiaries had benefits for tax and 
financial reporting operating loss carryforwards of $38,403 and $38,900, 
respectively, most of which can be carried forward indefinitely.  All of 
the foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3,093 are available through 1995.

   Provision has not been made for additional U.S. or foreign taxes on 
undistributed earnings of certain international operations as those 
earnings will continue to be reinvested.  It is not practicable to 
estimate the additional taxes, including applicable foreign withholding 
taxes, that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such 
earnings.

4.   EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of 
shares of common stock outstanding during the year, adjusted for shares 
issued in acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests and stock 
splits distributed to shareholders.  Fully diluted earnings per share 
are not presented because such dilution is not material.

5.   INVENTORIES

Inventories valued on the last-in, first-out cost method are 
approximately 40% in 1994 and 36% in 1993 of total inventories.  The 
current cost of these inventories exceeds their valuation determined on 
the LIFO basis by $130,710 in 1994 and $130,610 in 1993.  Progress 
payments of $11,429 in 1994 and $12,964 in 1993 are netted against 
inventories.

6.   LINES OF CREDIT

At June 30, 1994, the Company had available $50,000 through a multi-
currency unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks.  
The interest on this credit agreement, which expires October 1996, is 
based upon the type of debt advanced.  The agreement also requires a 
facility fee equal to 1/8 percent of the commitment per annum. Covenants 
in the agreement include a limitation on the Company's debt to debt-
equity ratio.  The Company had $660 outstanding under this credit line 
at June 30, 1994.

   The Company has other lines of credit, primarily short-term, 
aggregating $55 million, from various foreign banks.  Most of these 
agreements are reviewed annually. At June 30, 1994, the Company had $11 
million outstanding under these lines of credit.

   The Company is also currently authorized to sell up to $200 million 
of short-term commercial paper notes.  These notes are rated A-1 by 
Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's.  There were no commercial paper 
notes outstanding at June 30, 1994 or 1993. 

7.   LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt at June 30 consists of the following:
                                                        1994        1993

       9.6%, due 1995-1998                            10,286      14,286 
       9.45%, due 1998-2017                                      100,000 
       10.375%, due 1999-2018                        100,000     100,000 
       9.75%, due 2002-2021                          100,000     100,000 
    Industrial revenue bonds
       2.05% to 8.25%, due 1995-2015                  25,121      30,671 
    ESOP loan guarantee
       8.41%, due 1995-1996                           25,697      36,764 
Foreign:
    Bearer bonds
       5.75%, due 1995                                            35,142 
    Bank loans, including revolving credit
       2.25% to 12.0%, due 1995-2006                  10,842      17,314 
Other long-term debt, including capitalized leases     1,864       1,207 
Total long-term debt                                 277,810     441,384 
Less long-term debt payable within one year           20,551      62,908 
Long-term debt, net                                $ 257,259   $ 378,476 

Principal amounts of long-term debt payable in the five years ending 
June 30, 1995 through 1999 are $20,551, $20,865, $7,853, $5,395, and 
$10,516, respectively.


                               Page 13-24

   The carrying amount of the Company's notes payable approximates fair 
value.  The fair value of the Company's long-term debt (excluding 
leases) was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the 
Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of 
borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value of this debt, $277,215, was 
estimated to have a fair value of $284,499.

   In November 1993, the Company used cash from operating activities to 
early-retire $100,000 of 9.45 percent debentures due November 1997 
through 2016, resulting in an early redemption premium and write-off of 
deferred issuance costs totaling $4,207, which is net of income taxes of 
$3,515.  In addition, the Company early-retired $3,509 of 15.08 percent 
Australian debt due in 1995, resulting in an early redemption premium of 
$316.  These have been accounted for as extraordinary items in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

   ESOP loan guarantee -  In February 1989, Parker established a 
leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which covers 
substantially all domestic employees.  Under the ESOP, the Company 
established a trust which borrowed $70 million.  The loan is 
unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and therefore the unpaid 
balance of the borrowing is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as Long-term debt.  An equivalent amount representing Deferred 
compensation is recorded as a deduction from Shareholders' equity. 
Proceeds of this borrowing were used by the ESOP to purchase 2.5 million 
shares of the Company's common stock on the open market at an average 
cost of $28 per share. Commencing July 1, 1989, and continuing over the 
period of the loan, the shares purchased by the ESOP with the loan 
proceeds are being allocated to employees who make contributions to the 
Company's existing 401(k) Savings Plan.  Company contributions plus 
interest income and dividends earned on the unallocated shares are used 
to service the loan. Company contributions in excess of loan service 
requirements are used to obtain additional shares, which are all 
allocated to employees.  Compensation and interest components of ESOP 
expense, equal to the amount of Company contributions to the ESOP, are 
included in Net income.
                                             1994       1993       1992
Company contributions to the ESOP        $ 15,764   $ 15,217   $ 14,523

Interest expense on ESOP debt              (2,848)    (3,764)    (4,550)

   Lease Commitments - Future minimum rental commitments as of June 30, 
1994, under noncancelable operating leases, which expire at various

   On August 16, 1990 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, 
from time to time, of up to 3 million shares of the Company's common 
stock on the open market, at prevailing prices.  The repurchases were 
funded from operating cash flows and the shares are being held as 
treasury stock.

   The Company's stock option and stock incentive plans provide for the 
granting of incentive stock options and/or nonqualified options to 
officers and key employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price 
not less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock on the dates 
options are granted.  All outstanding options are exercisable one year 
after the date of grant and expire no more than ten years after grant.  
At June 30, 1994, the Company had 3,131,656 common shares reserved for 
issuance in connection with these plans.  Additional information as to 
shares subject to options is as follows:

   The Company derives a tax deduction measured by the excess of the 
market value over the option price at the date nonqualified options are 
exercised.  The related tax benefit is credited to additional capital.  
The Company makes no charges against capital with respect to options
granted.

9.   RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Pensions -- The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension 
plans covering eligible employees, including certain employees in 
foreign countries.  Benefits for salaried plans are generally based on 
the employees' compensation during the three to five years prior to 
retirement.  Under the hourly plans, benefits are generally based on 
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. The Company 
also has contractual arrangements with certain key employees which 
provide for supplemental retirement benefits.  In general, the Company's 
policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, tax 
considerations, local practices and investment opportunities.  The 
Company also sponsors defined contribution plans and participates in 
government-sponsored programs in certain foreign countries.  
Contributions and costs are determined as a percentage of each covered 
employee's salary.

                               Page 13-27
<PAGE>

   Pension costs for all plans were $10,850, $14,649 and $10,369 for 
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Pension costs were reduced in 1994 
by curtailment gains of $1,899 for the Metal Bellows divestiture.  
Pension costs for all defined benefit plans are as follows:

                                             1994        1993       1992

Net periodic pension costs              $   9,767    $ 13,683   $  9,458

   For domestic plans, the weighted average discount rates and the rates 
of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the 
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations were 8% and 
5%, respectively, at June 30, 1994 and 1993.  The expected long-term 
rate of return on assets was 9% at June 30, 1994 and 1993.  For the 
principal foreign plans located in the United Kingdom and Germany, the 
weighted average discount rates used were 7.5% and 7%, respectively, at 
June 30, 1994 and 9% and 6.5%, respectively, at June 30, 1993 and rates 
of increase in future compensation used were 5.5% and 4.5%, 
respectively, at June 30, 1994 and 7% and 4%, respectively, at June 30, 
1993.  The rates of return on assets used in the United Kingdom were 
8.5% at June 30, 1994 and 10% in 1993 and was 7% at June 30, 1994 for 
Germany.

   The following tables set forth the funded status of all the plans 
accounted for using SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, and 
the amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet:

   The majority of the underfunded plans relate to foreign and
supplemental executive plans.

   The plans' assets consist primarily of listed common stocks, 
corporate and government bonds, and real estate investments.  At June 
30, 1994 and 1993, the plans' assets included Company stock with market 
values of $10,068 and $7,824, respectively.

   Other Postretirement Benefits--The Company provides postretirement 
medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and eligible 
dependents.  Most plans are contributory, with retiree contributions 
adjusted annually.  The plans are unfunded and pay stated percentages of 
covered medically necessary expenses incurred by retirees, after 
subtracting payments by Medicare or other providers and after stated 
deductibles have been met.  For most plans, the Company has established 
cost maximums to more effectively control future medical costs.  The 
Company has reserved the right to change or eliminate these benefit 
plans.

   As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, with respect 
to its domestic postretirement benefit plans effective July 1, 1991.  
Certain of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have similar plans for 
retirees.  However, most retirees outside the United States are covered 
by government-sponsored and administered programs, and the cost of the 
postretirement programs are not significant.  Postretirement benefit 
costs included the following components:
                                             1994       1993       1992
Service cost-benefits attributed to 
 service during the period               $  3,414   $  3,767   $  3,622 
Interest cost on accumulated 
 postretirement benefit obligations         9,656      9,009      7,826 
Net amortization and deferral                 364       (125)
Net periodic postretirement 
 benefit costs                           $ 13,434   $ 12,651   $ 11,448 

                               Page 13-29
<PAGE>

   The following table reconciles the plans' combined funded status to 
amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet:

                                                      1994         1993

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:
 Retirees                                        $ (61,488)   $ (49,800)
 Fully eligible active plan participants           (27,532)     (27,060)
 Other active plan participants                    (39,026)     (42,989)
 Unrecognized (gain) loss                            6,976        6,768 
 Unrecognized prior service cost                       754          816 
Accrued postretirement benefit costs             $(120,316)   $(112,265)

   For measurement purposes, an 11.25% annual rate of increase in the 
per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) 
was assumed for 1995.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 6% 
by 2007 and remain at that level thereafter.  The health care cost trend 
rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported.  To 
illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1 
percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30, 1994 by $5,535, and the 
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic 
postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by $429.  The 
weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation was 8% at June 30, 1994 and 1993.

10.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

The Company's major foreign operations are located in Germany, the 
United Kingdom, Brazil, France, and Italy.  Their business activities 
are conducted principally in their local currency. 

   Assets and liabilities of most foreign subsidiaries are translated at 
current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using 
weighted average exchange rates.  The effects of these translation 
adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain intercompany 
transactions, are reported in a separate component of Shareholders' 
equity.  Such adjustments will affect Net income only upon sale or 
liquidation of the underlying foreign investments, which is not 
contemplated at this time.

   Exchange gains and losses from transactions in a currency other than 
the local currency of the entity involved, and translation adjustments 
in countries with highly inflationary economies (Argentina, Brazil and 
Venezuela), are included in income.  Net transaction and translation 
adjustments reduced Net income in 1994, 1993 and 1992 by $382, $2,218 
and $1,168, respectively. Such amounts are net of the tax benefits from 
monetary corrections for inflation and exclude the effect on Cost of 
sales resulting from valuing inventories at acquisition cost since sales 
price increases in each year more than offset this effect.

                               Page 13-30
<PAGE>
   Net sales, Income before income taxes (and before extraordinary item 
in 1994 and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in 
1992) and Net income include the following amounts from foreign 
operations:

                                           1994         1993         1992
Net sales                             $ 588,098    $ 616,717    $ 583,044 
Income before income taxes              (17,070)     (25,804)      (7,595)
Net income                              (14,594)     (17,468)      (6,588)

   Net assets of foreign operations at June 30, 1994 and 1993 amounted 
to $416,756 and $349,407, respectively.

   Accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign operations reinvested 
in their operations amounted to $38,938, $58,101, and $79,142 at June 
30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

11.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Research and development costs amounted to $64,518 in 1994, $60,054 in 
1993, and $50,019 in 1992.  Customer reimbursements included in the 
total cost for each of the respective years were $22,640, $16,648 and 
$20,089.  The costs and customer reimbursements amounts for 1993 and 
1992 have been restated to be consistent with 1994.  All years now 
include costs related to independent research and development as well as 
customer reimbursed and unreimbursed development programs.

12.  CONTINGENCIES

The Company is self-insured in the U.S. for health care, workers 
compensation, general liability and product liability up to 
predetermined amounts, above which third party insurance applies.  The 
Company purchases third party product liability insurance for products 
manufactured by its international operations and for products that are 
used in aerospace applications.

   Product Liability - The Company's costs are limited by third party 
insurance coverage to $2,000 per occurrence and $6,000 per year.  As of 
June 30, 1994 the Company has a reserve of $11,848 for product liability 
costs accrued, of which $3,298 is for claims incurred but not reported.  
This reserve is estimated using the history of claims paid over the last 
ten years, and is net of $2,148 to discount at a 7.5% annual rate those 
claims expected to be paid over the next eight years.  As an offset to 
this liability, the Company has an account receivable of $710 for 
anticipated insurance recoveries for litigation matters regarding 
asbestos-related product liability.


                               Page 13-31
<PAGE>
   Environmental - The Company is subject to environmental laws and 
regulations which require the Company to remove or mitigate the effect 
on the environment of the disposal or release of certain chemical 
substances.  The Company is currently involved in environmental 
remediation at 22 manufacturing facilities presently or formerly 
operated by the Company and has been named as a "potentially responsible 
party", along with other companies, at 7 off-site waste disposal 
facilities.  

   As of June 30, 1994, the Company has a reserve of $10,718 for 
environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable.  This 
reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of net costs to be 
incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of 
remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by 
governmental authorities, the amount of the Company's liability in 
proportion to other responsible parties and any recoveries receivable.  
This reserve is net of $638 for discounting at an 8% annual rate a 
portion of the costs at 7 locations for established treatment procedures 
required over periods ranging from 5 to 21 years.  The Company also has 
an account receivable of $533 for anticipated insurance recoveries.

   The Company's estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites 
ranges from a minimum of $10,678  to a maximum of $30,651.  The actual 
costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final 
delineation of contamination, final determination of remedial action 
required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with respect to 
cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in 
investigatory and remedial technology, effectiveness of remedial 
technologies employed, the ultimate ability to pay of the other 
responsible parties and any insurance recoveries.

Report of Management

The Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy 
of the financial information contained in this annual report.  
Management believes that the financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in 
the circumstances and that the other information in this annual report 
is consistent with those statements.  In preparing the financial 
statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where 
necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions 
that have not been completed.

Management is also responsible for maintaining an internal control 
system designed to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that 
assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that 
financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.  The system is supported by written policies and guidelines, 
by careful selection and training of financial management personnel and 
by an internal audit staff which coordinates its activities with the 
Company's independent accountants.  To foster a strong ethical climate, 
the Parker Hannifin Code of Ethics is publicized throughout the Company.  
This addresses, among other things, compliance with all laws and 
accuracy and integrity of books and records.  The Company maintains a 
systematic program to assess compliance.

Coopers & Lybrand, independent accountants, are retained to conduct an 
audit of Parker Hannifin's financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards and to provide an independent 
assessment that helps ensure fair presentation of the Company's 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed entirely of 
outside directors.  The committee meets periodically with management, 
internal auditors and the independent accountants to discuss internal 
accounting controls and the quality of financial reporting.  Financial 
management, as well as the internal auditors and the independent 
accountants, have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Parker Hannifin Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Parker 
Hannifin Corporation and its subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and 
the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994.  These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test 
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, 
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parker 
Hannifin Corporation and its subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and 
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994 in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed 
its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
and accounting for income taxes in 1992.
