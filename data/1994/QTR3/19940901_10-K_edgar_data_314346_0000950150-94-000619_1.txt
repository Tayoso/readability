Item 1.  Business

Bell Industries, Inc. ("Bell" or "the Company") is primarily a national
distributor of electronic components. In addition, Bell also distributes
graphic arts and recreational-related products. Bell presently employs 1,400
persons.

The Electronics Group (79% of 1994 sales) includes one of the nation's largest
electronic components distributors, which sells semiconductors; passive and
electromechanical components; connectors; and personal computers, software and
related accessories. The group also manufactures high-precision,
close-tolerance products for the computer and aerospace markets. The Graphic
Arts Group (13% of 1994 sales) distributes electronic imaging equipment, film,
plates, chemicals, and related supplies throughout California and southern
Nevada to the advertising and printing industries. After-market products for
the recreational vehicle, motorcycle, mobile home, snowmobile, and marine
industries are distributed by the Recreational Products Group (8% of 1994
sales).

The Electronics Group's distribution business markets electronic components
through seven regional service centers and over 20 sales facilities located
throughout the United States. Regional service centers support selling
operations in the following geographic areas and locations: Northwest
(Sunnyvale, California); Southwest (Orange County, California); Central
(Chicago, Illinois); Heartland (Indianapolis); Northeast (Boston,
Massachusetts); Mid-Atlantic (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and Southern
(Orlando, Florida). The group's microcomputer distribution and services
business is based in Indianapolis, Indiana and provides services through four
facilities located in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Electronics manufacturing
facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, Mountain View, California and
Gardena, California.

The Graphic Arts Group is based in Los Angeles, California and markets its

For the most part, the Company's facilities are fully utilized, although excess
capacity exists from time to time, based on product mix and demand. Management
believes that these properties are in good condition and suitable for their
present use.

The Company has subleased substantially all of the facilities related to
discontinued operations.

FISCAL 1994 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1993

Overall Results

For fiscal 1994, net sales increased 23% to $451.2 million and operating income
increased 27% to $28.2 million. Income from continuing operations, as well as
net income, was $9.1 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to income from
continuing operations of $5 million, or $.81 per share, in fiscal 1993. After
providing for the effects of an accounting change and losses on discontinued
operations, the Company recorded a net loss of $5 million, or $.81 per share,
in the prior year.

Continuing Operations

Electronics Group sales increased 27% to $358 million and operating income
increased 35% to $23.7 million. The improved performance was primarily
attributed to strong electronic component shipments, including the first
significant sales from the Company's franchise agreement with IBM
Microelectronics. Operating income improvement was attributed to stronger
sales, while operating expenses remained unchanged due to the Company's
restructuring and cost control programs. These improvements were partially
offset by reductions in gross margins in electronic components sales due to
product mix changes primarily arising from increased sales of lower margin
memory and microprocessor products. While IBM products contributed to the
group's excellent performance for the year, the longer term impact of this line
on the Company's electronics business is difficult to judge given IBM's recent
entry in the electronic component merchant market.

The Electronics Group sells the following products to over 20,000 customers
nationally:  semiconductors (Analog Devices, IBM, Maxim, National
Semiconductor, SGS-Thomson, Siliconix); passive components (Aromat, Bourns,
Kemet, Vishay); connectors (Amphenol, Berg); computers (Apple, Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM); power supplies (Power-One) and board-level products. The
group provides value-added services including Bell's Just-In-Time Delivery
System, assembly of custom cables, harnesses and connectors, contract
purchasing and direct programming of chips. Group manufacturing operations
produce switches, push-buttons and electroluminescent panels used in commercial
aircraft; precision stampings used in the personal computer industry; and
electronic components including coils, filters and chokes marketed under the 
J. W. Miller name.

Graphic Arts Group sales increased 6% to $58.8 million while operating income
decreased 34% to $1.4 million. Margin pressures resulting from adverse economic
conditions in California contributed to the overall decrease in operating
performance for the group.  Results during the last half of fiscal 1994
improved over the first six months as a result of programs to increase gross
margins and reduce operating expenses.

Major product lines distributed by the Graphic Arts Group include film, plates,
chemicals and other printing supplies from Agfa, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, and 3M,
as well as prepress and related electronic imaging equipment from Agfa, Apple,
Howtek, Intergraph, and Screen.

Sales and operating income for the Recreational Products Group increased 24% to
$34.4 million and 20% to $3.1 million, respectively. Sales and income growth
resulted from enhanced efforts to penetrate winter product markets and the
expansion of certain product lines.





                                       8

The Recreational Products Group sells parts and accessories to dealers for
motor homes, mobile homes, motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats and other
recreational vehicles. The group supplies more than 9,000 recreational
vehicle-related products, as well as over 8,500 marine items, 11,000 motorcycle
items, and 4,000 snowmobile items. Major product lines distributed by the group
include Alcoa, Coleman/Recreational Products, Inc., Dunlop, NGK, and Nordyne.

The following table sets forth the consolidated percentage relationship of
various costs and expenses to net sales:

The increase in cost of products sold primarily resulted from product mix
changes in electronics distribution. Selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased as a result of cost control programs. Interest expense
decreased due to reductions in long-term debt. The Company's income tax rate on
continuing operations was 42% in both fiscal 1994 and 1993. In fiscal 1992, the
income tax rate of 53.5% resulted from lower earnings and the effects of
certain expenses for which tax benefits are limited, including goodwill and
state income taxes.

Discontinued Operations

During the last half of fiscal 1993, the Company recorded an after-tax charge
of $8.1 million in connection with a plan to dispose of its Building Products
Group. Income tax benefits of approximately $5.9 million were recorded in
connection with the disposal charge. In July 1993, the Company sold a majority
of the assets of the discontinued operations for approximately $11 million in
cash. During the first quarter of fiscal 1995, the Company sold substantially
all of the remaining operating net assets of the discontinued operations for
cash and notes totaling approximately $4.5 million.

FISCAL 1993 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1992

For fiscal 1993, net sales increased 3% to $365.3 million and operating income
increased 11% to $22.2 million. Income from continuing operations was 
$5 million, or $.81 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of
$0.9 million, or $.15 per share, for the prior year. The Company recorded a net
loss of $5 million, or $.81 per share, compared to net income of $0.4 million,
or $.07 per share, in fiscal 1992.

Electronics Group sales increased 3% to $282.2 million and operating income
increased 10% to $17.5 million. Sales growth was primarily attributed to strong
electronic component and computer systems shipments in the eastern, southern
and southwestern United States. Value-added and telemarketing programs also
contributed to the solid sales performance. In addition, sales increased as a
result of strong shipments of precision-stamped metal products for the
electronics and computer industries. Operating income improvement was
attributed to sales growth and previously announced restructuring and payroll
cost reduction programs and increased manufacturing volumes. These improvements
were partially offset by reductions in gross margins in electronics
distribution during the year due to product mix changes and competitive
pressures.

Graphic Arts Group sales were $55.4 million, a 5% increase over the prior year.
Operating income increased 32% to $2.1 million.  Sales and operating income
benefited from the expansion into new product lines, including electronic
imaging equipment, and stronger market performance in northern California.
Operating margins improved as a result of efficiency programs.

Recreational Products Group sales increased 7% due to stronger marketing
efforts and favorable weather conditions. Operating income increased slightly
as a result of increased sales offset by decreases in gross margins due to
competitive pricing efforts and changes in product mix.

In fiscal 1994, operating activities generated cash totaling $6.6 million
compared to $2.7 million in the prior year. The increase in operating cash
flows in fiscal 1994 was primarily related to the growth in earnings offset by
increased investment in working capital required to support the Company's
electronics business. Cash provided by investing activities included the
proceeds from the sale of certain assets of discontinued operations. Offsetting
these proceeds were payments for accounts payable and other obligations
relating to the discontinued operations. In addition, the Company invested $5.9
million to acquire a microcomputer distribution and services business during
the year. Investing activity cash flows in the prior year included the addition
of peripheral equipment for the Company's computer system and the addition of
leasehold improvements and related equipment at the Company's corporate
offices. Financing activity cash flows primarily included scheduled and
optional repayments on the Company's Senior Notes. Non-cash investing and
financing activities for fiscal 1994 included a $1.6 million equipment 
addition which was financed through a capital lease.

The Company believes that sufficient cash resources exist to support short-term
requirements, including debt and lease payments, and longer term objectives,
through available cash, bank borrowings, cash realized on the disposition of
discontinued operations, and cash generated from continuing operations.

The financial data included in the financial statement schedule should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. All other schedules
have been omitted because they are not applicable or the required information
is shown in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto. The
individual financial statements of the Company have been omitted since the
Company is primarily an operating company and the subsidiaries included in the
consolidated financial statements are considered wholly owned and deemed to be
totally held and do not have indebtedness to any person other than the Company
or its consolidated subsidiaries in amounts which together exceed five percent
of total consolidated assets as of June 30, 1994.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
Price Waterhouse LLP


To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Bell Industries, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Bell Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits in fiscal 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Cash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Revenue recognition and receivables - The Company is a distributor of
electronic components, graphic arts supplies and equipment, and
recreational-related products. Sales are recognized and trade receivables are
recorded when products are shipped. Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to trade receivables are limited due to the large number and general dispersion
of trade accounts which constitute the Company's customer base. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral. The Company estimates reserves for potential credit losses
and such losses have been within these estimates.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using
weighted average and first-in, first-out methods) or market (net realizable
value).

Properties, depreciation and amortization - All properties are depreciated
using the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives which range
from 15 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 10 years for machinery and
equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of their estimated service lives or the term of the
lease.

Intangibles - Cost in excess of the fair value of net assets of purchased
businesses (goodwill) is amortized using the straight-line method over 25
years. The costs of other intangible assets purchased from acquired businesses,
primarily composed of customer lists, franchise agreements and the assembled
work force, are being amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.

Income taxes - Provision is made for the tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets
and liabilities. In estimating deferred tax balances, the Company considers all
expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or
rates.





                                       18
<PAGE>   19

Stock option plans - The Company recognizes compensation expense relating to
the plans in an amount equal to the difference between the market value of
shares at the date of option grant and the expected proceeds upon exercise.
Such compensation expense is accrued ratably over the period to be benefited.
When an installment of a grant is exercised, common stock is credited with the
par value of shares issued and other paid-in capital is credited with the
balance of market value at date of grant.

Per share data - Operating results data per common and common equivalent share
is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding, after adjustment to reflect the 4% stock dividend declared
in July 1993. Common equivalent shares represent the net number of shares which
would be issued assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options, reduced by the
number of shares which could be repurchased from the proceeds of such
exercises.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

During fiscal 1993 the Company adopted two new accounting principles, Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" and SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for
Income Taxes."

The Company provides postretirement medical coverage for qualifying employees.
Annual costs associated with these benefits, which were immaterial to the
Company's financial results, were previously expensed as incurred. In 1993, the
Company implemented SFAS No. 106 and elected to record the previously
unrecognized obligation covering prior years for postretirement medical
coverage provided to qualifying employees. The charge of $830,000 relating to
this accounting change was recorded net of estimated tax benefits of $600,000.
Accumulated and vested benefit obligations relating to postretirement medical
benefits were not significant at June 30, 1994 and 1993.

SFAS No. 109 replaced the Company's prior method of accounting for income taxes
under SFAS No. 96. The cumulative and current annual impact of the accounting
change was not material to the financial position or operating results of the
Company.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In April 1993, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a plan to dispose of
its Building Products Group. In connection with this plan, the Company recorded
an after-tax loss on disposal of $8.1 million which included a provision for
future operating costs during the phase-out period, primarily lease commitments
of approximately $2.0 million, and adjustments of net assets to estimated
realizable values. Income tax benefits of $5.9 million were recorded in
connection with the disposal charge.

In July 1993, the Company sold a majority of the assets of the discontinued
operations for approximately $11 million in cash. The Company retained
liabilities, primarily accounts payable and accrued payroll costs, in
connection with the asset sale. During the first quarter of fiscal 1995, the
Company sold substantially all of the remaining operating net assets of the
discontinued operations for cash and notes totaling approximately $4.5 million.

COMPUTER WRITE-DOWN

During 1992, management decided to replace the mainframe computer which was
utilized by a substantial portion of the Company's operations. The resulting
before-tax charge of $4.4 million represented the remaining book value of the
old computer equipment which was replaced.

The Company's bank loan agreement provides for a $25 million secured revolving
line of credit which is available through October 1995. Borrowings against the
line accrue interest at either the bank's reference rate or LIBOR plus .875%
(5.375% at June 30, 1994). The Company is subject to an annual commitment fee
of .25% on the unused line of credit.

The agreement underlying the 9.70% Senior Notes, as amended, requires the
Company to make annual principal payments. In addition, the Company has the
right, but not the obligation, to prepay $2 million in fiscal 1995. Interest
payments on the Senior Notes are due in semi-annual installments.

The fair value of the Senior Notes at June 30, 1994 was approximately $39
million. The fair value was estimated using an interest rate currently
available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

In connection with certain amendments to the Senior Note agreement, the
noteholders received warrants to purchase 187,200 shares of the Company's
common stock. The warrants may be exercised at any time prior to February 1,
2001 at $13.05 per share.

The Senior Notes and bank borrowings under the revolving line of credit are
secured by receivables and certain inventories of the Company. These agreements
contain various provisions for the maintenance of financial ratios and amounts,
limitations on long-term borrowings, payments of cash dividends, and other
provisions.

Aggregate maturities of notes payable are as follows (in thousands):

COMMON STOCK

The Company's 1990 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan), which
succeeded the 1981 Restricted Stock Purchase Plan, authorized 500,000 shares of
common stock to be available for purchase by employees. Under the 1990 Plan,
both incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock may be granted. At June 30, 1994, 511,097 shares were reserved
for future issuance under both plans.

shareholders of record on August 20, 1993. Share and per share amounts were
adjusted to give effect to the dividend.

Collateral Trust Indenture, as amended by this Amendment, the "Amended
Collateral Trust Indenture"), dated as of June 1, 1992, between the Company and
the Security Trustee.

                                   RECITALS:

     A.     The Company entered into separate Note Purchase Agreements
(collectively, as amended, the "Note Purchase Agreement") with each of the

($50,000,000) of 9.70% Senior Notes due February 1, 2001 (the "Notes");

     B.     The Company has entered into a certain Second Amended and
Restated Loan Agreement, dated August 13, 1992, with the Bank, (as amended

the "Existing Loan Agreement") which provided for the extension of credit by
the Bank to the Company in the nature of a revolving line of credit as

maximum principal amount of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and for the
extension of a trade letter of credit facility in the maximum amount of Three
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000).  The Company has requested that the Bank,
and the Bank has agreed to, increase the amount of credit available under the
New Revolving Note to a maximum principal amount of Twenty-Five Million Dollars

the New Loan Agreement to a maximum aggregate principal amount of Twenty-Five
Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($25,300,000).

     C.  Certain obligations of the Company owed to the Holders and the Bank
have been secured pursuant to the Existing Collateral Trust Indenture and that
certain Security Agreement, dated as of June 1, 1992, between the Company and
the Security Trustee (the "Existing Security Agreement," and the Existing

Agreement").

     D.  As a condition precedent to entering into the New Loan Agreement, the
Bank requires that the contemplated increase in the maximum principal amount of
credit available to the Company thereunder be secured by the Existing
Collateral Trust Indenture and the Existing Security Agreement.

     E.  The Company has requested the Holders and the Bank to amend and modify
the Existing Collateral Trust Indenture and the Existing Security Agreement, as
in effect on the date hereof and has also requested the Bank to enter into the
New Loan Agreement.

     the Required Secured Parties.

                 "(b)    The Collateral is now, and at all times shall be,
     solely owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens, security
     interests, claims and encumbrances, except as permitted under the Note
     Purchase Agreements and the New Loan Agreement.  The security interests of

     Collateral Trust Indenture and any Permitted Liens).  The Company shall,
     at the request of the Required Secured Parties, defend the Collateral from
     all claims and demand of all other Persons.  The Company shall comply with
     the requirements of all state and federal laws, rules and regulations in
     order to grant the security interests herein granted in and to the
     Collateral, to maintain the perfection and priority of such security
     interests and to permit the Security Trustee to realize promptly and

     Parties from time to time to evidence, perfect, preserve the priority of,

     expense, execute and deliver to the Security Trustee such financing
     statements pursuant to the Code or any other applicable Uniform Commercial
     Code, and other papers, documents, resolutions, certificates or
     instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Security Trustee or the
     Majority Secured Parties in connection with this Agreement, and the
     Company hereby authorizes the Security Trustee to execute and file at any
     time and from time to time one or more financing statements or copies
     thereof or of this Agreement with respect to the Collateral signed only by
     Security Trustee.

                 "(c)    The Company shall not assign, sell, transfer, or
     otherwise dispose of, nor shall the Company suffer or permit any of the
     same to occur with respect to, any Collateral other than (i) in respect of
     the sale of California Inventory in the ordinary course of business, on
     open account or for cash and on terms substantially similar to the terms
     currently being extended by the Company to its current customers, (ii) as
     otherwise permitted under the Note Purchase Agreements and the New Loan
     Agreement, (iii) in respect of the collection of checks, drafts, money
     orders or other instruments in respect of the Accounts as contemplated by

     notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Note Purchase Agreements
     and the New Loan Agreement, the Required Secured Parties may, in their
     sole discretion, withdraw the aforesaid permissions to assign, sell,
     transfer or otherwise dispose of California Inventory upon the existence
     of any Event of Default.

     access to and right of inspection of the Collateral and any records
     pertaining thereto (and the right to make extracts from and to receive
     from the Company originals or true copies of



                                       11

     upon request therefor).

                 "The Company shall advise the holders of Secured Obligations
     promptly and in sufficient detail of any substantial change relating to
     the type, quantity or quality of the California Inventory or any event
     which would have a material adverse effect on the value of the California
     Inventory.

                 "The Company shall maintain the Books and Records and such
     other records as will enable it and the Security Trustee to determine the
     status of each Account.

                 "(e)    Anything contained in the Note Purchase Agreements or
     the New Loan Agreement notwithstanding, the Company agrees to maintain
     insurance, with financially sound and reputable insurers acceptable to the
     Required Secured Parties, with respect to the California Inventory and any
     returned, repossessed or reclaimed tangible personal Property included in
     the Collateral against casualties, contingencies, hazards and such other
     risks (including, without limitation, (i) fire, hurricane, tornado, wind
     damage, and such other risks insured against by a standard all-risk
     property and fire insurance policy and endorsement for extended coverage
     and (ii) flood, earthquake and public disturbance insurance) and in such
     amounts as shall be satisfactory to the Required Secured Parties.  The
     Company shall deliver the copies of the policies of such insurance to the
     Security Trustee with satisfactory lender's loss payable endorsements
     naming the Security Trustee as loss payee to the extent of its interest
     and as such interest may appear.  Each such policy of insurance or
     endorsement shall contain a clause requiring the insurer to give not less
     than ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Security Trustee in the
     event of cancellation of the policy for any reason whatsoever and a clause
     that the interest of the Security Trustee shall not be impaired or
     invalidated by any act or neglect of the Company.  If the Company shall
     fail to provide and pay for such insurance, or have the same provided and
     paid for, the Security Trustee, upon being instructed by the Required
     Secured Parties, may, at the Company's expense, procure the same, but may
     not be required by the Company to do so.  The Company agrees to deliver to
     the Security Trustee, promptly as rendered, true copies of all reports
     made in any reporting form to insurance companies.

                 "Anything contained in the Note Purchase Agreements or the New
     Loan Agreement notwithstanding, the Company shall maintain or caused to be
     maintained insurance with financially sound and reputable insurers with
     respect to its Property and business (including, without limitation, the
     Collateral) covering any public and/or product liability of the Company or
     its officers, agents or employees and in such amounts as are satisfactory
     to the Required Secured Parties.  The Security Trustee shall be named as a
     co-insured on such policies.  The Company shall deliver to the Security
     Trustee on the Effective Date evidence of insurance of the type and in the
     amounts provided for in this Section 2.2(e) being in full force and effect
     and payment of all premiums in respect thereof."

            4.1.3.  is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is 
     in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the

     4.2.    The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Amendment, and to perform its
obligations under the Amended Collateral Trust Indenture and the Amended

     laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally; and

            4.3.2.  subject to the availability of equitable remedies.

     4.4.    The authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of

result in the imposition of a Lien (as such term is defined in the Note
Purchase Agreement) upon any Property (as such term is defined in the Note
Purchase Agreement) of the Company


                                       14

with, or taking of any other action in respect of or by, any federal, state or

defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) is required with respect to:

                 4.5.1.    the authorization, execution and delivery by the
         Company of this Amendment; or

delivery by the Company of this Amendment, the Lien (as such term is defined in
the Note Purchase Agreement) of the Amended Security Agreement and the Amended
Collateral Trust Indenture will continue to constitute a valid and perfected
security interest in and to the Collateral (as such term is defined in the
Amended Security Agreement), and such Lien will continue to have such priority
with respect to such Collateral as such Lien had immediately preceding the
consummation of the foregoing transactions.

         4.7.    After giving effect to this Amendment, no Default or Event of
Default will exist under the Note Purchase Agreement and no default or event of
default exists under the Amended Collateral Trust Indenture, the Amended
Security Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreements or the New Loan Agreement.

To each of the Holders of Warrants Named 
on the Signature Lines Below


             Re:     Warrants to Purchase Shares of Common Stock

Dear Sirs and Madams:

     Reference is hereby made to the Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant
Agreement"), dated as of September 15, 1993, among Bell Industries, Inc.  (the
"Company") and each of the holders of the Warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase
shares of the Common Stock, par value $.25 per share, of the Company named
below (the "Holders").  Capitalized terms used herein, and not defined herein,
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

          1.     The Company agrees, and each of the undersigned Holders
agrees, that, upon the effectiveness of this letter agreement, the first
sentence of the definition of "Market Price" contained in Section 6 of the
Warrant Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                 " 'MARKET PRICE' shall mean, as of any date of determination, 
          the arithmetic mean of the daily Closing Prices for the twenty (20) 
          consecutive trading days immediately preceding such date of 
          determination; provided that if the Common Stock is not then listed 
          or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or quoted
          in the over-the-counter market, then 'Market Price' shall mean the 
          greater of (i) the book value of one share of Common Stock, as 
          determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
          principles, as of the date of determination, and (i) the Fair 
          Valuation of one share of Common Stock, as of the date of 
          determination."

Except as expressly set forth in this paragraph 1, the Warrant Agreement shall
not be amended hereby and shall remain in full force and effect.

          2.     Each undersigned Holder agrees that, upon the effectiveness of
this letter agreement, the Holders waive any right or entitlement to receive
any payment of liquidated damages from the Company pursuant to Section 5.1(d)
of the Warrant Agreement in respect of, and waive the effect of any default or
violation which occurred or may have occurred pursuant to the Warrant Agreement
solely in respect of, the failure of Amendment No. 2 to the Company's
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 33-71030), as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on April 18, 1994, to be declared effective by the
Securities Exchange Commission prior to April 19, 1994.
<PAGE>   2

      This letter agreement shall become effective and binding upon the Company
and each Holder upon the execution and delivery of a counterpart of this letter
agreement by the Company, the Required Warrantholders and the Holders of at
least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of all Registrable Stock then
outstanding (excluding any Registrable Stock directly or indirectly held by the
Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate).

     If you are in agreement with the provisions of this letter agreement,
please so indicate by executing it below.

                                  Yours very truly,
