Item 1.     Business
_________   __________         


(a)     The Registrant, Delchamps, Inc.  (the "Company") is a 
corporation which was organized under the laws of the State of
Alabama in 1946; from the Company's founding in 1921 until it
was incorporated, it operated as a partnership.  The Company
operates a chain of supermarkets under the name "Delchamps" in 
Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi and has operated
continuously for over 70 years.

     The number of supermarkets operated by the  Company has
grown from 110 at June 30, 1990 to 115 at June 27, 1992, and
120 at July 2, 1994.  In addition to regularly opening new
stores, the Company expands and remodels existing units, and 
closes outmoded or unprofitable stores.  During the five years
ended July 2, 1994, the Company closed 11 outdated or un-
profitable stores and opened 27 new stores that are all
considerably larger than the stores that were closed.  The 
Company also remodeled and expanded 22 stores during the same 
5 year period.

     The Company, in addition to operating supermarkets, operates
twelve liquor stores in the State of Florida.  Eleven are 
small units located adjacent to the Company's supermarkets, and 
the twelfth liquor store, operating under the name of "The
Liquor Place", is a free-standing unit of approximately 26,000
square feet from a converted Delchamps supermarket in Pensacola,
Florida.

     The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Supermarket Cigarette
Sales,  Inc., functions as the purchasing agent and
distributor for cigarettes sold by the Company's supermarkets
in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida.

     The 120 supermarkets operated by the Company at July 2, 
1994 range in size from 12,000 square feet to 57,669 square
feet, and average 40,068 square feet.  The average square 
footage of selling area per supermarket increased from ap-
proximately 26,291 square feet at June 30, 1990, to approximately
28,950 at July 2, 1994, and the total sales area in all
stores increased from 2,892,000 to 3,474,000 square feet
during the same period.  The Company's new stores will range
from approximately 46,000 to 62,000 square feet in size (and
from approximately 34,000 to 47,000 square feet of selling
space) depending upon the size of the store's market area.

     The Company plans to continue to expand the supermarket 
chain through the addition of new supermarkets in its present
areas of operation, in new market areas and through expansion
of existing stores.
     
     The Company opened three new supermarkets during fiscal year
1994, closed one store, and has opened or has plans to open
four additional supermarket during fiscal year 1995.  Four
stores were expanded during the 1994 fiscal year and the Company
plans to remodel and expand nine existing supermarkets in fis-
cal 1995.
     
     The following table sets forth certain statistical information
with respect to the Company's operations for the periods indicated:

</TABLE>


     The Company believes that a vital factor in a successful
supermarket expansion program is the careful selection of store
locations.  The Company analyzes prospective locations on a continuous
basis, both internally and with assistance of outside
consultants, and locates stores primarily in suburban shopping
centers in areas with stable or growing middle and upper-middle
class populations.  The Company enlarges, modernizes, relocates
or closes stores in light of their past performance and the 
Company's assessment of their future potential.

(b)     Financial information on industry segments and lines of 
business is omitted because, apart from its principal business
of operating retail self-service food stores and liquor stores, 
the Company had no other lines of business or  industry segments.

(c)     (i)     Merchandising is the responsibility of the Senior Vice
President of Merchandising who supervises the directors of 
the five merchandising departments:   Grocery; Meat; Produce;
Deli/bakery; and General Merchandise and Health and Beauty
Care.  The department directors, in turn, supervise the twelve
category managers responsible for purchasing and merchandising 
various lines of products.
     
     The Company's principal merchandising strategies are to 
maintain an overall value image and to achieve high sales
volume by offering quality products and services at 
competitive prices.  Since the Company's stores carry many of the 
same products, centralized purchasing and distribution facilities
are essential.  All purchases are made by specialized
category managers under central buying procedures, rather than
on a store-by-store basis, which allows the Company to maintain
quality control of its products and to take advantage of 
volume discounts.  Inventories are adjusted on a frequent
basis to take into account seasonal changes in consumer demand.
     
     Delchamps supermarkets operate on a self-service basis, and 
the vast majority are open from 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. seven
days per week, except Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving.  The
Company's beachfront stores are open 24 hours per day four
months out of the year.  The supermarkets are clean, spacious,
air conditioned, well-lighted, colorfully decorated, well-stocked
equipped with modern features and adjacent to offstreet
parking facilities.  Except in selected locations, customers
carry their own purchases from the check-out counters to their
automobiles unless they ask for special assistance.
     
     Delchamps supermarkets carry fresh meat and produce,
frozen and other convenience foods, dairy products, specialty
and other gourmet products, and general grocery products, as well as
selected lines of non-grocery merchandise.  All stores opened
during the last several years have contained salad bars,
bakeries, delicatessens and service meat departments and offer
prepared ready-to-eat foods.  In addition, delicatessens, salad
bars, bakeries and service meat departments have been added
to most of the Company's other larger stores.  Seafood 
departments, video departments, banking facilities and dining
areas have been added to several stores and nearly all new
stores will offer these departments.  The Company operates one
pharmacy and intends to add pharmacies to selected locations.
     
     The Company's supermarkets offer a selection of national 
and regional brand-name products, generic products and products
bearing brand names of Topco Associates, Inc. ("Topco"), a
cooperative purchasing organization of which the Company is a 
shareholding member.
     
     The Company's affiliation with Topco, the largest cooperative
grocery products purchasing organization in the United
States, enables it to procure quality merchandise on a competitive
basis with larger, national food retailers.  Topco's membership
of 32 retail grocery chains and wholesalers located
throughout the United States enables it to employ large volume
buying techniques on behalf of its members.  Topco products are
sold under its own brand names, such as "Food Club", "Topco",
"Top Fresh" and "Top Frost", or under generic labels.  The
Company's purchases from or through Topco were approximately
20% of total inventory purchases in fiscal year 1994, 23%
in 1993, and 26% in 1992.  The Company's president serves as a 
director of Topco.
     
     Advertising and promotion are important factors in the 
Company's merchandising strategy.  In fiscal year 1994, the 
Company's advertising expenditures, including television, radio,
newspaper, magazine and circular advertising, were .90% of
sales.  The  Company's advertising program features a quality
image, emphasizing value with competitive prices and "bonus
buys" (merchandise purchased at reduced prices from vendors and 
featured for resale with favorable retail prices).  The Company
does not issue trading stamps at any of its stores and does not 
expect to do so in the future.
     
     Store operations are the responsibility of the Senior Vice
President, of Retail Operations, who supervises the Company's 
Vice President, Retail Operations, who in turn supervises the
Company's six area supervisors.  Each area supervisor is 
responsible for approximately 15 to 25 supermarkets in his area.
Area supervisors regularly visit the supermarkets under their
jurisdiction, thereby providing continuous, direct supervision
of day-to-day store operations, including such matters as
quality of merchandise, adequacy of staffing levels and 
adherence to Company policies.  Each supermarket is individually
supervised by a store manager, assistant store managers, a meat 
market manager and other department managers.  The Company's 
management monitors the results of operations of each
supermarket through the close and direct supervision of the 
area supervisors.
     
     The Company stresses the importance of customer satisfaction 
with its associates and insists that associates provide
courteous and efficient service.  Customer satisfaction is also
achieved through rapid response to changing consumer tastes
and well-stocked stores.  Additionally, it is the Company's
polity to have a management or supervisory associate respond
personally to customer complaints.
     
     Technology also enables the Company to more efficiently
serve its customers.  The use of such technological advances
as computerized scanning check-out equipment, direct store
delivery systems and time and attendance systems are designed
to enhance customer satisfaction and employee productivity.
     
     The Company was among the first grocery chains  
operating in the Southeast to install computerized scanning check-out
equipment in its stores and now has such equipment in all of
its stores.  A computerized order entry system is used at each
of the Company's supermarkets to record merchandise orders and 
transmit them electronically to the Company's central distribution
facilities.  Restocking is achieved through frequent deliveries
from the Company's central distribution centers and from
local suppliers, thus minimizing the space required at each 
store for warehousing inventory.
     
     A computerized direct store delivery system has been implemented 
in all of the Company's stores.  This system improves
accounting for and control of the merchandise delivered directly
to the Company's supermarkets by suppliers, which represented
30% of total merchandise inventory purchases in fiscal year 1994.
In addition, an electronic time, attendance and work scheduling system, 
utilizing the same hardware as the direct store delivery system, has been 
installed in the Company's supermarkets.  This latter system assists the 
Company in controlling labor costs through more efficient use of manpower.
     
     Advances in technology are important to the Company's 
ability to improve productivity and keep costs in line and 
emphasis will continue to be placed on innovations in this area.
     
     The Company's supermarket products are purchased from over
1,000 suppliers, of which Topco is by far the most important,
supplying approximately 20% of the Company's total inventory
purchases during fiscal year 1994.  No other supplier accounted
for more than 5% of the Company's purchases during the fiscal
year.  During fiscal year 1994, approximately 70% of inventories
(valued at cost) were supplied to the Company's stores
through its central distribution facilities in Mobile and Hammond.
The remaining items were furnished directly to the stores
by local distributors.  Major product lines supplied in this
manner included beverages, bread and snack foods.
     
     The Company's central distribution facilities are serviced
by rail and truck and are operated 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week.  All supermarkets receive deliveries 7 days per week from
the Mobile and Hammond facilities through a transportation
fleet leased by the Company.  The Company believes that its
distribution system has an effective range of approximately
350 miles in all directions.

(ii)     The Company has not publicly announced or otherwise made
public information about any new product or industry segment
that would require the investment of a material amount of the 
assets of the Company or which otherwise is material.

(iii)     Sources and availability of raw materials are factors
that do not directly affect the Company's business.

(iv)     Patents and trademarks owned by the Company are not of 
material importance to its operations.

(v)     Seasonality does impact the Company, as sales tend to increase
in the summer season because certain of its stores are 
located near Gulf Coast beaches.

(vi)     The Company has no unusual working capital requirements.

(vii)     The business of the Company is not dependent upon a single
or a few customers.  The Company does not sell goods or 
services in an amount that equals 10 percent or more of the 
Company's consolidated revenue to any single customer or group
of customers under common control or to any affiliated group of 
customers.

(viii)   Backlog ordering is not a factor in the business of the Company.

(ix)    No portion of the business of the Company is subject to 
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts 
at the election of any government.

(x)     The supermarket business is intensely competitive.  The
number of competitors and the amount of competition experienced
by the Company's supermarkets vary by location.  Principal competitive
factors include store location, price, service, convenience,
cleanliness and product quality and variety.  Because the 
supermarket business is characterized by narrow profit margins,
the Company's earnings depend primarily on the efficiency of its
operations and its ability to maintain a large sales volume.
     
     The Company's principal competitors are the supermarket
chains operated by Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., The Great Atlantic 
and Pacific Tea Company, Bruno's, Inc., The Kroger Co. and  
Albertson's, Inc., and other large regional and national food 
store chains.  Both Winn-Dixie and A&P compete with the Company 
throughout Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
Bruno's Supermarkets compete with the Company's Alabama,
Florida and Mississippi Gulf Coast supermarkets.  Albertson's
competes with the Company in the Florida panhandle
and certain locations in Louisiana.  Kroger has stores on the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast and Central and Southwestern Louisiana.
Delchamps supermarkets also compete with local supermarkets, 
specialty and convenience food stores and local chains that 
have significant market shares in limited aeas, such as the 
Schwegmann Brothers' Giant Supermarket chain in Southeastern
Louisiana.  Certain of the Company's major competitors have 
financial resources that are substantially greater than those of 
the Company.

(xi)    The Company did not spend a material amount on Company
sponsored research and development activities or on customer
sponsored research activities relating to the development of 
new products, services or techniques, or the improvement of 
existing products, services or techniques during fiscal years
1994, 1993, and 1992.

(xii)  The Company's compliance with federal, state, and local 
provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of 
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection 
of the environment has not had, and is not expected to have, a material 
effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

(xiii)  At the end of fiscal year 1994, the Company had approximately
4,065 full-time and 4,095 part-time employees, none of 
whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

(d)     The Company does not engage in any operations in foreign
countries, nor is any portion of its sales or revenue derived
from customers in any foreign country.  All sales by the Company
occur at locations in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.


Item 2.          Properties
_________       ______________

     The Company leases all of its supermarkets under standard
commercial leases, no one of which is material to the Company.
Most of these leases are for a period of 20 years,
and contain several renewal options.  The leases provide for
fixed rentals ranging from $2.00 to $14.15 per square foot, with 
an average rental of $7.45 per square foot.  Many of its leases,
including most of the leases negotiated in the last five years,
provide for the payment by the Company of taxes, insurance and
certain maintenance expenses, as well as additional rental based
on sales volume.  One of the Company's store leases is
scheduled to expire by the end of the 1995 fiscal year, and no
more than five leases will expire in any one year thereafter
until the year 2005.

The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Delchamps, Inc.

Under date of August 5, 1994, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets 
of Delchamps, Inc. and subsidiary as of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and 
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and 
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 2, 1994, 
as contained in the 1994 annual report to stockholders.  These financial 
statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual 
report on Form 10-K for the year 1994.  In connection with our audits of the 
aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the 
related supplementary financial statement schedules as listed in the

express an opinion on these supplementary financial statement schedules based 
on our audits.

In our opinion, such supplementary financial statement schedules, when

as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set 
forth therein.

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for assets acquired
after July 1, 1984; for assets acquired before July 1, 1984, depreciation is  
computed primarily on the double-declining balance method, except for 
buildings acquired after 1969 on which depreciation is computed on the 
150% declining balance method.  The Company uses the following period for 
depreciating and amortizing property and equipment:

                 Buildings                                10-50 years

Reports of Independent Auditors and Management
______________________________________________________________________________
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Delchamps, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delchamps, 
Inc. and subsidiary as of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and the related 
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended July 2, 1994.  These 
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
     
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.
     
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Delchamps,
Inc. and subsidiary at July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year 
period ended July 2, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
     
As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the Company 
changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1994 to adopt
the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits".  As discussed in note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for income 
taxes in 1994 to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes".

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The Management of Delchamps, Inc. and subsidiary (the "Company") is 
responsible for the preparation, integrity, and objectivity of the 
consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in the 
Annual Report.  The consolidated financial statements were prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts 
and interpretations that are based on Management's best estimates and 
judgments.
     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting control which 
provides reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable for 
preparation of financial statements and that assets are properly accounted 
for and safeguarded.
     The consolidated financial statements were audited by KPMG Peat Marwick 
LLP, independent auditors appointed by the Stockholders of the Company upon 
the recommendation of the Board of Directors.  Their audits provide an 
independent review of Management's discharge of its responsibilities for 
reporting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  
The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, the majority of 
whom are outside directors, meets periodically with the internal and 
independent auditors to review their accounting, financial and audit reports 
and any recommendations they have for improvements in the system of internal 
accounting control.

DELCHAMPS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993, and June 27, 1992

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)  Description of Business
     
     Delchamps, Inc. and subsidiary (the "Company")  are
engaged in the business of retail food distribution through
the Company's supermarkets located in Alabama, Florida
Louisiana, and Mississippi.

(b)  Definition of Fiscal Year
     
     The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday
closest to June 30.  Fiscal years 1994 and 1992 comprised
52 weeks while fiscal year 1993 comprised 53 weeks.

(c)  Principles of Consolidation
     
     The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of Delchamps, Inc. and its wholly owned
wholesale subsidiary.  All significant intercompany balances
and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.

(d)  Cash Equivalents
     
     For purposes of the consolidated statements of 
cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

(e)  Merchandise Inventories
     
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out ("LIFO")  basis for
87% of inventories in 1994, 85% in 1993, and 87% in 1992.
With respect to the remaining inventories, primarily produce
and market, cost is determined on the first-in, first-out ("FIFO")
basis.  Inventories developed from the retail method
comprised approximately 50% of total inventories in 1994,
52% in 1993, and 58% in 1992.

(f)  Property and Equipment
     
     Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Buildings 
and equipment acquired prior to July 1, 1984 are depreciated
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using
primarily the double-declining-balance method.  Buildings
and equipment acquired subsequent to July 1, 1984, are
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective 
assets using the straight-line method.
      
     Buildings and equipment under capital leases are 
stated at the lower of the present value of the minimum
lease  payments at the beginning of the lease term or fair
value of the property at the inception of the lease.  Assets
leased under capital leases and leasehold improvements
are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser
of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related
assets.  The Company uses the following periods for depre-
ciating and amortizing property and equipment:

Buildings............................... 10-50 years
Leasehold improvements......................10 years
Fixtures and equipment....................5-10 years

(g) Cost in Excess of Fair Value of Assets Acquired
    
    Cost in excess of fair value of assets acquired arose
from the purchase of 3 supermarkets and real estate in 
August, 1987 and is being amortized over a 40 year period
on a straight-line basis.
     
(h)  Income Taxes
     
     Deferred income taxes are recognized for all
significant temporary differences between the tax basis and 
financial statement amount of assets and liabilities.  The tax
consequences of those differences expected to occur in 
the subsequent year are classified as a current asset
or liability.
     
     Job credits are recorded as a reduction of the pro-
vision for Federal income taxes in the year realized.
     
     In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109")
which supersedes SFAS No. 96.  Under the asset and 
liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to tax-
able income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under SFAS No. 109,
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in 
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date.
     
     In fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, 
and has reported the cumulative effect of that change in the 
method of accounting for income taxes in the 1994 consolidated 
statements of earnings.

(i)   Earnings Per Share
            
     Earnings per share are computed by dividing net 
earnings by the weighted average number of shares of 
common stock outstanding.

(2) Cash Equivalents
           
    Cash equivalents are stated at cost which
approximates market value.  Cash equivalents at July 2, 1994, and 
July 3, 1993 consisted of the following:

                                      =========== ===========

(3) Merchandise Inventories
     
     The  Company uses the LIFO method of valuing
certain of its merchandise inventories to minimize inflation
induced inventory profits and to achieve a better matching of 
current costs with current revenues.  Inventories would
increase by approximately $13,012,000 at July 2, 1994 and 
$13,050,000 at July 3, 1993 if all of the Company's inventories 
were stated at cost determined by the first-in, first-out
method.  Further, net earnings would decrease by approxi-
mately $24,000 in fiscal year 1994, increase by $130,000 in
fiscal year 1993, and decrease by $732,000 in fiscal year
1992, after applying the Company's marginal tax rate and 
without assuming an investment return on the applicable
income tax savings.
     
     The Company is a member of a cooperative asso-
ciation from which it purchases private label merchandise
for resale and certain store equipment.  Merchandise inven-
tories purchased from this cooperative association approxi-
mated 20% of total inventory purchases in 1994, 23% in 
1993, and 26% in 1992.

(4) Leases
          
     The Company leases certain store properties and 
warehouse equipment under capital leases that expire over
the next 13 years.  The Company also leases store proper-
ties, and transportation equipment under noncancelable
operating leases that expire over the next 23 years.
Contingent rentals on store properties are paid as a
percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum.  In
the normal course of business, it is expected that most
leases will be renewed or replaced by leases on other
properties and equipment.
     
     Included in property and equipment are the following
amount applicable to capital leases:

    Agreements underlying the notes payable contain
restrictive covenants which limit the payment of dividends,
additional debt, lease rentals, and transactions with affiliates,
and require maintenance of certain working capital and
equity levels.  At July 2, 1994, the Company was in compliance
with all covenants.  At July 2, 1994, approximately $22,070,000
of the Company's retained earnings was available for the 
payment of dividends under such restrictive provisions.
     
     Cash payments for interest were approximately
$4,312,000, $5,383,000, and $5,275,000 in 1994, 1993 
and 1992, respectively.
     
     Aggregate annual maturities on long-term debt for 
fiscal years after July 2, 1994 are approximately as follows:

     Based on the borrowing rates currently available
to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and 
maturities, the fair value of the long-term debt outstanding
at July 2, 1994 approximates the carrying value.

(6)  Notes Payable

     Notes payable as of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993
consisted of the following:

                                     (In thousands)

Unsecured borrowings under
lines of credit, due on
various dates throughout
fiscal 1995, with floating
interest rates that are 
currently less than the 
prime rate                      $ 11,574        3,847



     At July 2, 1994, the Company had $93,426,000
in available unsecured lines of credit with various financial
institutions which expire throughout fiscal 1995 and provide for 
interest at rates of at least 200 basis points below the prime 
interest rates.

(7) Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan

     In November 1987, the Company leveraged its
existing Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP").  The
ESOP used the proceeds of the loan to purchase approxi-
mately 1,097,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
The common stock is held by the ESOP trustee in a 
"suspense account" and these shares serve as collateral for
the loan.  Each year the Company will make a contribution to
the ESOP which the trustee will use to make principal
payments.  With each loan payment a portion of the common
stock is released from the "suspense account" and allocated
to participating employees.  The Company is required to pay
interest on the loan in excess of any dividends received on
unallocated shares.
     
     The Company guaranteed $20 million of ESOP debt
under the loan agreement.  The loan is repayable in 10 equal 
annual installments of principal, with the final installment due
in June 1996.  Interest is payable quarterly at a rate equal to
80% of the prime rate.  The loan obligation of the ESOP 
is considered an unearned employee profit sharing trust con-
tribution and is recorded as a reduction of the Company's
stockholders' equity.  Both the loan obligation and the unearned
employee profit sharing trust contribution are reduced by the 
amount of any loan repayments made by the ESOP.


(8)  Employee Benefit and Incentive Plans
     
     The Company has a profit-sharing plan and an 
employee stock ownership plan covering substantially all
employees who have completed two years of service.  The
total annual contributions to these plans for fiscal years
1994, 1993, and 1992 were as follows:

                                      (In thousands)

Employee stock ownership plan     $2,000    2,000    2,000

     The Company has an incentive compensation plan for
certain management personnel tied to the Company's overall
performance.  There was no charge to operations for this plan 
in 1994, $2,274,000 was charged to operations in 1993 and 
$725,000 in 1992.
     
     In fiscal 1988, the Company adopted, with stock-
holder approval, a restricted stock award plan.  The plan
provides that a maximum of 150,000 shares of common
stock be awarded to key executives.  During 1989, 138,000  
shares were awarded to key executives at a price of $.01
per share.  No shares have been awarded since 1989.  Total
compensation expense to be charged to operations over the
term of the plan is approximately $3,209,000.  Total
compensation expense associated with the plan was determined
based on the difference between the market value and the 
purchase price of the stock at the date of award, and is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over the period
the restrictions lapse.  Charges to operations for this plan
were approximately $215,000 in 1994, $219,000 in 1993,
and $262,000 in 1992.
     
     In February 1992, the Company repurchased shares 
previously awarded to three key executives.  A total of 18,000
shares was repurchased for $.01 per share, the cost to the 
key executives at award date.  Restricted stock awards totaling
$481,000 and representing the market value of the awarded
shares at grant date, were retired concurrent with the repurchase.


(9)  Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions

     Effective for fiscal year 1994 the Company adopted 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
("SFAS No. 112"), "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." Under SFAS No. 112, the cost of employment
benefits must be recognized on an accrual basis as
employees perform services to earn the benefits.
     
     The Company provides a bonus to associates who
leave employment.  The amount of the bonus is based on 
longevity.
     
     The Company previously expensed the cost of this
bonus as incurred.  The  Company has elected to recognize
this change in accounting principle on the immediate recog-
nition basis.  The cumulative effect for fiscal year 1994 of
adopting SFAS No. 112 was an increase in accrued postemploy-
ment benefit costs of $2,600,000 ($1,600,000 after the income)  
tax benefit of $.22 per share).

(10) Income Taxes
     
     As discussed in note 1, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109") for fiscal
1994.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting for 
income taxes of $900,000 is determined as of July 4, 1993
and is reported separately in the consolidated statements of 
earnings for the year ended July 2, 1994.  Prior years'
financial statements have not been restated to apply the
provisions of SFAS No. 109.
     
     The components of income tax expense are as follows:

     No valuation allowance was recorded against the 
deferred tax assets at July 2, 1994.  The Company's manage-
ment believes the existing net deductible temporary differences
comprising the total gross deferred tax assets will reverse
during the periods in which the Company generates net
taxable income.
     
     The sources of deferred income taxes and their tax 
effects are as follows:

     Cash payments for income taxes were approximately
$5,741,000, $5,452,000, and $3,896,000 in 1994, 1993,and 
1992, respectively.


(11)  Share Purchase Rights Plan

     In October 1988, the Company adopted a Share
Purchase Rights Plan and declared a dividend distribution
of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock.
Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Junior Participat-
ing Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $70, subject to
adjustment.  The Company will be entitled to redeem the 
Rights at $.01 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of the 
expiration of the Rights in October 1998 or ten days following
the time a person or group acquires or obtains the right to
acquire a 15% position in the Company.  The Rights do not
have voting or dividend privileges.  Until such time as they
become exercisable, the Rights have no dilutive effect on the 
earnings per share of the Company.

(12) Commitments and Contingencies

     The Company is a defendant in various claims and legal
actions considered to be in the normal course of business.
Management intends to vigorously default these claims
and believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
consolidated financial condition.
     
     In fiscal 1989, and subsequently, the Company has 
entered into certain agreements with officers and key man- 
agement.  The agreements contain provisions entitling each
officer or employee covered by these agreements to receive
from 1 to 3 times his annual compensation (as defined) if 
there is a change in control of the Company (as defined) and
a termination of employment.  The agreements also pro-
vide for severance benefits under certain other circumstances.
The agreements do not constitute employment contracts and 
only apply in circumstances following a change in control of 
the Company.  In the event of a change in control of the 
Company and termination of all persons covered by these
agreements, the cost would be approximately $10,000,000.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION

      The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the financial statement and notes thereto 
contained herein.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     At the end of the 1994 fiscal year Delchamps operated
120 supermarkets in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and 
Louisiana, compared with 118 at the end of the 1993 fiscal
year and 115 at the end of fiscal year 1992.  The Company
also operated twelve liquor stores in Florida at the end of
fiscal year 1994, compared with ten liquor stores at the end

     Sales increased in 1994 because of the addition
of new supermarkets (three were opened in 1994 and four
were opened in 1993), the expansion of supermarkets (four
were expanded in 1994 and seven were expanded in 1993),
and same store sales increased 1.2% based on a compa-
rable 52 week period in fiscal year 1993.  Same store
sales increased because of supermarket expansions
and increased sales from promotional activities.  Promo-
tional activities include increased "Bonus Buy" promotions
(in which certain products are featured at reduced retail
prices), implementing a continuity program and 
introducing a line of soft drink products with Delchamps
as the brand name.  In addition, there was significant
growth in the existing Cash Back For Schools program (in
which the Company makes cash donations to schools
equal to 1% of the total cash register receipts collected
by each school over a specified time period).

     Sales increased in 1993 because of the addition of 
new supermarkets (four were opened in 1993 and six were
opened in 1992), the expansion of supermarkets (seven
were expanded in 1993 and five were expanded in 1992),
the extra week in the 1993 53-week period compared to the 
1992 52-week period, and same store sales increased 3.2%
based on a comparable 53-week period for fiscal year 1992.
Same store sales increased in 1993 because of supermarket
expansions and success from promotional activities.  Promo-
tional activities included Double Coupons (implemented
during fiscal year 1992 under which the Company doubles 
coupons that have a face value of up to sixty cents), Triple 
Coupons (implemented in selected markets during fiscal
year 1993 under which the Company triples coupons that
have a face value of up to thirty-four cents), and Cash Back
For Schools (implemented during fiscal year 1992).

     Sales decreased in 1992 because same store sales
decreased.  Same store sales decreased because of a 
sluggish economy, heavy promotional activity by competitors,
food price deflation of approximately 1.5%, and the opening
of a significant number of supermarkets by competitors.  As
noted above, the Company implemented the Double Coupon
and Cash Back For Schools programs in an effort to improve
sales trends.  In addition, the Company continued its program
of remodeling and expanding existing supermarkets in 
order to add service departments and increase the variety
of merchandise sold.  These efforts resulted in improved
sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1992.

     Gross profit percentage decreased slightly in 1994
because of increased markdowns (retail price reductions)
from the "Bonus Buy" promotional program.

      Gross profit percentage increased in 1993 because
of increased buying allowances, increased sales of higher
margin products located in the specialty departments of 
the Company's newer and expanded supermarkets, and 
increased sales of private label products (which have higher
margins than brand name products).

     Gross profit percentage decrease in 1992 because 
of increased promotional activity and reductions in retail prices.

     SG & A expense increased in 1994 because of 
increased supermarket expenses which occurred primarily
as a result of new and expanded supermarkets.  Supermarket
expenses that increased over the 1993 period include the 
following: wages and salaries increased $3.5 million, utilities
increased $1.2 million, promotion expenses relating to the 
Double Coupon program and continuity program (described
in the sales section) increased $2.2 million, and building rent
increased $2.7 million.  Wages and salaries, utilities and rent
increased primarily because of new and expanded supermarkets.
Promotion expenses increased because of the 
implementation of the continuity program in 1994.  SG & A
increased as a percentage of sales over the 1993 fiscal year
because the 1993 period included 53-weeks; therefore, in
1993 fixed costs such as rent and depreciation were divided
into sales for a 53-week period.

     SG & A expense increased in 1993 because of added
costs of new and expanded supermarkets and the extra         
week in the 1993 53-week period compared to the 1992
52-week period.  SG & A as a percentage of sales decreased
in 1993 as a result of the additional week in 1993.  The decline
was also attributable to savings from an ongoing cost con-   
trol program which improved labor scheduling, reductions in 
advertising and improvements in the utilization of supplies.
   
     SG & A expense in 1992 increased because of added 
costs associated with new and expanded supermarkets.
SG & A as a percentage of sales increased in 1992 because
of slow sales growth combined with the increased cost of 
operating new locations and service departments.

Decrease from prior year           (83)        (158)      (36)

     Interest expense decreased in 1994 primarily
because the Company refinanced $25 million of long-term
debt at the end of the 1993 fiscal year.  The interest rate on
this debt was reduced to 5.51% from 7.70%  The decrease
in interest expense was also caused by lower levels of 
indebtedness and a general decline in interest rates. 

     Interest expense increased in 1993 because of
increased levels of short-term indebtedness under the 
Company's lines of credit.  Interest expense decreased 
in 1992 because of an overall decline in interest rates and 
because the Company refinanced a large portion of its debt
at lower interest rates.
     
     Interest income decreased in the 1994, 1993, and 
1992 periods.  These decreases resulted from lower levels
of invested cash and reduction in interest rates.

     In fiscal year 1994, the Company's effective income 
tax rate decreased from the 1993 level because earnings 
decreased (in 1994 the majority of earnings were taxed at 
a Federal rate of 34% and in 1993 the majority of earnings 
were taxed at a Federal rate of 35%) and targeted jobs tax 
credits were reinstated by the Revenue Reconciliation
Act of 1993.
     
     In fiscal year 1993, the Company's effective income
tax rate increased because of the expiration of targeted
jobs tax credits.  The effective rate in 1993 approximates
the combined Federal and states statutory rates.

     In fiscal year 1992, the Company's effective income
tax rate decreased because of decreased earnings combined
with consistent levels of targeted jobs tax credits.

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", ("SFAS No. 109") which
supersedes SFAS No. 96.  The Company implemented
SFAS No. 109 in fiscal year 1994.  The cumulative effect of 
implementing SFAS No. 109 was to increase earnings $900,000.
     
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,"
("SFAS No. 112") which the Company implemented in fiscal
year 1994.  SFAS No. 112 requires that postemployment
benefits, representing longevity bonus, be recognized on
an accrual basis.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS
No 112 was to decrease earnings $1,600,000.

     Net earnings decreased in 1994 from 1993 because
same store sales growth decreased (to 1.2% in 1994 from
3.2% in 1993) and the Company experienced an increased
rate of growth in SG & A expenses (to 23.3% of sales in
1994 from 22.8% of sales in 1993).

     Net earnings for 1993 increased because of improved
sales, an increase in gross profit margin, and a reduction in 
SG & A expenses.     

     Net earnings for 1992 decreased because of weak 
sales and a decline in gross profit margin.

     In fiscal years 1994 and 1993, the rate of inflation 
was relatively unchanged from the prior year.  Fiscal year
1992 had deflation of approximately 1.5%.  The effect of
inflation on the Company's operating earnings is considered
to be minimal.  Management does not expect the Company
to be adversely affected by future inflation because a large
number of its stores are leased at fixed rents for up to
twenty-five year periods and because increases in the cost
of merchandise can be generally passed on through retail
price increases.  While inflation has not had a material impact
on past operating results, there is no assurance that the  
Company will not be affected by inflation in the future.

     Inventory turnover decreased slightly in 1994 compared
to 1993 because the 1994 period was a 52-week fiscal year
compared to the 1993 period which was a 53-week fiscal year.

     In 1993, inventory turnover increased because the 1993
period was a 53-week period compared to the 1992 period which
was a 52-week fiscal year.

     Inventory turnover decreased in 1992 because
of weak sales and higher inventory levels.  Inventory levels
increased because of the introduction of the Company's 
new and expanded formats, which contain significantly
greater square footage, more inventory and more 
service departments.

     In fiscal year 1994, dividends as a percentage of net
earnings increased from 1993 because of decreased earnings
in 1994.  Dividends paid per share remained unchanged
for the 1994, 1993 and 1992 periods.

     The Company's plans with respect to store construction,
acquisition, remodeling, and expansion are frequently
reviewed and revised in light of changing conditions.  In 
addition, the Company's ability to proceed with projects, or to
complete projects during a particular period, is subject to
successful negotiation of satisfactory contractual arrangements,
and the timing of projects is subject to normal construction
and other delays.  Therefore, it is possible that not all the 
projects described above will be commenced or completed
in fiscal year 1995, and it is possible that a portion of the 
expenditures with respect to projects commenced during a
fiscal year carry over to the next year.

Financing and Liquidity

     Although the Company's supermarket locations are
leased, the Company makes substantial expenditures to  
equip new and expanded supermarkets.  The cost to equip a
new supermarket is approximately $2.3 million while the 
cost to equip an expanded supermarket is approximately
$1.7 million.  In addition, the Company makes substantial
expenditures for distribution center facilities and equipment.
The Company plans to finance its capital expenditures
with funds provided by operations.  However, if an insufficient
amount of funds is generated, the Company may
obtain long-term financing or draw on short-term credit lines.
The Company has $105.0 million in credit lines from financial
institutions of which $93.4 million is available for future use.
While these credit lines expire throughout fiscal year 1995, the
Company expects the majority of these credit lines to be 
extended annually as they are deemed necessary.

    Working capital increased $5,415,000 to $54,926,000 
to July 4, 1993 to July 2, 1994.  Additions to property and 
equipment were $17,705,000 during fiscal 1994 and
consisted primarily of purchases of fixtures and equipment
for new and remodeled stores and equipment for distribution 
center facilities.
