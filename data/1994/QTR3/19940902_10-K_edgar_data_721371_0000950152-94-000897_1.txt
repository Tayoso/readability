                                     PART I


ITEM 1:  BUSINESS
- - -----------------

GENERAL
- - -------

         The Company is a national, full-service wholesaler distributing a
broad line of pharmaceuticals, surgical and hospital supplies, health and
beauty care products, and other items typically sold by hospitals, retail drug
stores, and other health care providers.  An important component of the
Company's distribution activities is the broad range of support services it
offers to its customers, which are designed to assist the Company's customers
in maintaining and improving their market positions.  These support services
foster strong relationships between the Company and its customers by
positioning the Company as a valuable resource capable of offering the
centralized services which are increasingly important in today's competitive
market place.  The Company believes that in most instances it would not be
economically feasible for its customers to develop and maintain these services
independently.

         Cardinal Health, Inc. is a holding company with sixteen principal
operating subsidiaries:  Whitmire Distribution Corporation ("Whitmire"); James
W. Daly, Inc. ("Daly"); Ellicott Drug Company ("Ellicott"); Cardinal Syracuse,
Inc. ("Syracuse"); Marmac Distributors, Inc.  ("Marmac"); Bailey Drug Company
("Bailey"); Ohio Valley-Clarksburg, Inc. ("Ohio Valley"); Chapman Drug Company
("Chapman"); Solomons Company ("Solomons"); Cardinal Florida, Inc. ("Florida");
Cardinal Mississippi, Inc. ("Mississippi"); Humiston-Keeling, Inc. ("H-K");
Behrens Inc.  ("Behrens"); National PharmPak Services, Inc. ("PharmPak");
National Specialty Services, Inc. ("NSS"); and PRN Services, Inc. ("PRN").
These separate operating subsidiaries are sometimes collectively referred to as
the "Cardinal Health" companies.  As used in this report, the "Registrant" and
the "Company" refers to Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries, unless the
context requires otherwise.  Prior to February 7, 1994, the Company was known
as Cardinal Distribution, Inc.  The term "Cardinal," as used herein, refers to
Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the business combination
with Whitmire on February 7, 1994.

         The Company distributes products to hospitals, drug stores, alternate
care centers, and the pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass
merchandisers located throughout the continental United States.  The Company
obtains its products from many different suppliers, the largest of which
accounted for approximately 7% (by dollar volume) of its net sales in fiscal
1994.  The Company's five largest suppliers accounted for approximately 29% (by
dollar volume) of its net sales during fiscal 1994.  The loss of certain
pharmaceutical or medical/surgical product suppliers could adversely affect the
Company's business because many suppliers are the sole source of certain
pharmaceuticals and medical/surgical products under exclusive patents or
processes.  The Company has agreements with many of its suppliers which
generally require the Company to maintain an adequate quantity of the
supplier's products in inventory.  These agreements typically have a term of
one year and may be canceled by either the Company or the supplier, without
cause, upon specified prior notice. Management believes that the Company's
relationships with its suppliers are excellent.

SUPPORT SERVICES
- - ----------------

         As a full-service wholesale distributor, the Company complements its
distribution activities by offering a broad range of value-added support
services to assist customers and suppliers in maintaining and improving their
market positions and to strengthen the Company's role in the channel of
distribution.  These support services include computerized order entry and
order confirmation systems, customized invoicing, generic sourcing programs,
product movement and management reports, consultation on store operation and
merchandising, and customer training.


                                      2
<PAGE>   3
         Most customers transmit merchandise orders directly to the Company's
data processing system through computerized order entry devices.  The Company's
proprietary software systems feature customized databases specially designed to
help its customers order more efficiently, contain costs, and monitor their
purchases which are covered by group contract purchasing arrangements.  Upon
receipt of the customer's order at a distribution center, the Company's
warehouse management system processes the order and provides customized price
information to facilitate the customer's pricing of items.  Customer orders are
routinely processed for next-day delivery, enabling the Company's customers to
minimize the size and carrying cost of their own inventories.  In addition, the
Company's AccuNet(R), Otis(R), and Network(TM) proprietary software systems
facilitate primary supply relationships between the Company and its customers
and enable the Company's customers to reduce their costs.  These systems
provide a variety of information which assist the customer to identify the best
price available under group purchasing contracts with pharmaceutical
manufacturers, maintain formulary compliance, and better manage their own
inventories.  Over 2,800 of these systems have been placed with hospital,
managed care, and chain drug customers located throughout the United States.


SPECIALTY WHOLESALING
- - ---------------------

         In addition to the comprehensive support services provided in
connection with its core drug wholesaling activities, the Company also offers
diversified "specialty wholesaling" enhancements to its customers and
suppliers.  For example, the Company's PharmPak subsidiary operates a
pharmaceutical repackaging program for both independent and chain customers.
In January 1992, the Company formed National Specialty Services, Inc. ("NSS").
NSS is a distributor of therapeutic plasma products and other specialty
pharmaceuticals to hospitals and other managed care facilities on a nationwide
basis through the utilization of telemarketing and direct mail programs.  In
December 1993, the Company expanded its specialty wholesaling business through
the acquisition of PRN Services, Inc., a distributor of pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies to oncologists and oncology clinics across the United States.
These specialty wholesaling activities are part of the Company's overall
strategy, which combines competitive pricing with diversified offerings in
order to enhance the profitability of its core business and that of its
customers and suppliers



CUSTOMERS
- - ---------

         The Company regularly supplies pharmaceuticals, surgical and hospital
supplies, health and beauty care products, and other items to hospitals,
independent and chain drug stores, alternate care centers, and pharmacy
departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers located throughout the
continental United States.  In fiscal 1994, approximately 50% of the Company's
net sales were to hospitals and managed care facilities, approximately 23% of
the Company's net sales were to chain drug stores and the pharmacy departments
of supermarkets and mass merchandisers, approximately 21% of the Company's net
sales were to independently owned drug stores, and approximately 6% of the
Company's net sales were to specialty wholesaling customers.

COMPETITION
- - -----------

         The Company's markets and those of its customers are highly
competitive.  The Company competes directly with other national and regional
wholesalers, direct selling manufacturers, mail-order houses, and specialty
distributors on the basis of price, breadth of product lines, marketing
programs, and support services.  The Company's businesses have narrow profit
margins and accordingly, the Company's earnings depend significantly on its
ability to distribute a large volume and variety of products efficiently and to
provide quality support services.

RECENT ACQUISITIONS
- - -------------------

         Since March 31, 1993, the Company has completed five business
combinations.  On May 4, 1993, the Company purchased Solomons Company, a
Savannah, Georgia based drug wholesaler serving customers located primarily in
the southeastern region of the United States.  On December 17, 1993, the
Company merged with PRN (see "Specialty Wholesaling" above).  On February 7,
1994, the Company completed its largest business combination to date when it
merged with Whitmire Distribution Corporation, a Folsom, California based drug
wholesaler (the "Whitmire Merger").  The majority of Whitmire's sales were
concentrated in the western and central United States, complementing Cardinal's
former concentration of sales in the eastern United States and positioning the
combined company to service both customers and suppliers on a national basis.
Whitmire's customer base was weighted toward hospital, managed care, and large
retail chain customers, complementing Cardinal's rapidly expanding presence in
these customer categories and Cardinal's well-developed programs and services
for independent retail pharmacies.

         The Company has completed two additional business combinations since
the Whitmire Merger.  On July 1, 1994, the Company purchased Humiston-Keeling,
Inc., a Calumet City, Illinois based drug wholesaler serving customers located
primarily in the upper midwest region of the Unites States.  On July 18, 1994,
the Company completed its merger with Behrens Inc., a Waco, Texas based drug
wholesaler serving customers located primarily in Texas and adjoining states.

         The Company continually evaluates possible candidates for acquisition
and intends to continue to seek opportunities to expand its healthcare
distribution operations and services.  For additional information concerning
the acquisitions described above see Notes 3 and 16 of "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements."

EMPLOYEES
- - ---------

         At August 1, 1994, the Company had approximately 3,500 employees, of
which approximately 300 are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The
Company considers its employee relations to be good.


REGULATORY MATTERS
- - ------------------

         The Company, as a distributor of prescription drugs, including certain
controlled substances, is required to register for permits and/or licenses with
appropriate federal and state agencies and comply with certain operating and
security standards.  In addition, the Company is subject to the Prescription
Drug Marketing Act of 1987, an amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
which requires each state to regulate certain aspects of the purchase and
distribution of prescription drugs.  The Company believes that it is in
substantial compliance with all federal and state statutes and regulations
applicable to its activities.


                                      4
<PAGE>   5


INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS
- - -----------------------

         An aging population, new product introductions, and a higher
concentration of distribution through wholesalers are all factors which have
created favorable growth patterns for the drug wholesaling industry.  At the
same time, it is also a very competitive industry undergoing rapid change and
consolidation.  A number of factors have in the recent past affected and are
expected to continue to affect the business equation for the Company,
including: (a) a greater mix of higher volume customers, where the lower cost
of distribution and better asset management and cash flow enable the Company to
offer lower pricing to the customer; (b) reduced inventory gains associated
with lower drug price inflation, which are partially offset by corresponding
decreases in last-in, first-out (LIFO) earnings charges and inventory carrying
costs; (c) increased merchandising funding from manufacturers, particularly
related to the growth in generic pharmaceuticals; (d) improved selling, general
and administrative cost absorption due to significant productivity investments
and the operating leverage associated with sales growth and acquisitions; and
(e) increased sales and earnings from specialty distribution services.

         In response to cost containment pressure from private and governmental
payers and the current focus on healthcare reform in the United States,
customers are consolidating into super-regional and national affiliations while
manufacturers are under increased pressure to slow the rate of drug price
inflation and to seek more cost-effective methods of marketing and distributing
their products.  In this regard, drug wholesalers, including the Company, will
be challenged to service customers over a wider geographic base, offer
manufacturers innovative marketing and distribution services, and provide both
manufacturers and customers with the common system and reporting links
necessary to streamline the efficient flow of product and information among
distribution partners.  Another consideration associated with healthcare reform
is the wide variety of legislation which has been proposed at both the federal
and state level.  The Company is unable to predict which, if any, of the
current legislative proposals may be adopted or what impact, if any, such
legislation would have upon the Company's business.



ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES
- - -------------------

         Because of the nature of the Company's business, office and
warehousing facilities are operated in widely dispersed locations across the
United States.  At August 19, 1994, the Company distributed products from forty
principal operating facilities located in twenty-six states, eight of which
are owned by the Company and the balance of which are leased.  The Company's
principal executive offices consist of leased office space located at 655 Metro
Place South, Dublin, Ohio.  The Company considers its operating properties to
be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet its present needs.  However,
the Company expects to make further additions, improvements, and consolidations
to its properties  as the Company's business continues to expand.

         For certain financial information regarding the Company's office and
warehousing facilities, see Notes 5 and 9 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements."

<PAGE>   6
ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- - --------------------------

         In November 1993, Cardinal and Whitmire  were each named as defendants
in a series of purported class action antitrust lawsuits which were later
consolidated and transferred by the Judicial Panel for Multi District
Litigation to the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois (the "Brand Name Prescription Drug Litigation").  Subsequent to the
consolidation, a new consolidated complaint ("amended complaint") was filed
which included allegations that the wholesaler defendants, including Cardinal
and Whitmire, conspired with manufacturers to inflate prices by using a
chargeback pricing system.  Cardinal and Whitmire have filed an answer denying
the allegations in the amended complaint.  Subsequent to the filing of the
answer, the wholesaler defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  The
Court has not yet ruled on the motion for summary judgment.  In addition to the
federal court case described above, Whitmire has been named as a defendant in a
series of state court cases alleging similar claims under various state laws
regarding the sale of Brand Name Prescription Drugs.  The Company believes that
both the federal and state court allegations against Cardinal and Whitmire are
without merit, and it intends to contest such allegations vigorously.

         The Company also becomes involved from time-to-time in ordinary
routine litigation incidental to its business, none of which is expected to
have any material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------
MATTERS
- - -------

        The Company's common shares, without par value (the "Class A Common
Shares") are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "CDIC."  
Application has been made, however, to list the Class A Common
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CAH" and such listing
is expected to occur in September 1994.

        The following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the range of
the reported high and low last sale prices of the Class A Common Shares as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market, and the per share dividends
declared thereon.  The information in the table has been adjusted to reflect
all stock splits and stock dividends and also to reflect the
Company's decision, as of March 1, 1994, to change its fiscal year end from
March 31 to June 30.

</TABLE>
 
        At August 19, 1994, there were approximately 1,150 shareholders of
record of the Company's Class A Common Shares.

        In connection with the Whitmire Merger in February 1994, the Company
issued Class B common shares, without par value (the "Class B Common
Shares"),  to a former Whitmire stockholder. Holders of Class B Common Shares
are entitled to one-fifth of one vote per share in the election of Directors
and upon all matters on which shareholders are entitled to vote.  At August 19,
1994, all 2,971,375 Class B Common Shares issued and outstanding were held by
one holder. There is no established public trading market for the Class B
Common Shares.

        All holders of Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares
(collectively, "Common Shares") participate equally in dividends when and as
declared by the Company's Board of Directors.  The Company paid a 25% stock
dividend on June 30, 1994, to effect a five-for-four stock split of the
Company's Common Shares.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay
quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment and amount of
future dividends remain within the discretion of the Company's Board of
Directors and will depend upon the Company's future earnings, financial
condition, capital requirements, and other factors.

ITEM 6:  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
- - --------------------------------

        The following selected consolidated financial data of the Company
has  been prepared giving retroactive effect to the business
combination with Whitmire Distribution Corporation ("Whitmire")
on February 7, 1994 (the "Whitmire Merger" ), which has been accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests transaction.  The term "Cardinal," as used herein, refers
to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the Whitmire Merger.
Cardinal's fiscal year has historically ended on March 31, while Whitmire's
fiscal year has ended on the Saturday closest to the end of June.  On March 1,
1994, the Company changed its fiscal year end from March
31 to June 30.  As a result, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1993, and
prior years, the information presented is derived from consolidated financial
statements which combine data from Cardinal for the fiscal years ended March
31, 1993, March 31, 1992, March 31, 1991, and March 31, 1990, with data from
Whitmire for fiscal years ended July 3, 1993, June 27, 1992, June 29, 1991, and
June 30, 1990, respectively.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, and the
twelve months ended June 30, 1993, the information presented is derived from
consolidated financial statements which combine data from Cardinal for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, and the twelve months ended June 30, 1993,
with data from Whitmire for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994, and July 3,
1993.   Due to the different fiscal year ends of the merged companies,
Whitmire's results of operations for the three months ended July 3, 1993, have
been included in both the twelve months ended June 30, 1993, and the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1993.  The selected consolidated financial data below
should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial
statements and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OF OPERATIONS
- - -------------

        Management's discussion and analysis presented below has been
prepared giving retroactive effect to the pooling-of-interests business
combination with Whitmire on February 7, 1994 (see Note 3 of
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").  The term "Cardinal," as used
herein, refers to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the
Whitmire Merger.  Cardinal's fiscal year has historically ended on March 31,
while Whitmire's fiscal year has ended on the Saturday closest to the end of
June. On March 1, 1994, the Company changed its fiscal
year end from March 31 to June 30.  Accordingly, the Company's consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, and for the
twelve months ended June 30, 1993, combine the information for Cardinal and
Whitmire as of June 30, 1994, and for each of the two years then ended.  The
Company's consolidated financial statements for earlier fiscal years combine
information for Cardinal's March year end with Whitmire's subsequent fiscal
June year end.  The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes
appearing in this report.

        The table below sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial
data expressed in a percentage relationship to net sales and in comparison to
prior periods.  The data for the twelve months ended June 30, 1993, is
unaudited and is presented for informational purposes only.  In the discussion
and analysis which follows the table, comments regarding the comparison of
fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1993 apply generally to the comparison of fiscal 1994 to
the twelve month period ended June 30, 1993.

        NET SALES.  Net sales in fiscal 1994 increased 25% compared to fiscal
1993 due to internal business growth of 20%, the merger with PRN Services, Inc.
in December 1993, and the acquisition of Solomons Company in May 1993 (see Note
3 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").  The 26% increase in net
sales in fiscal 1993 compared to fiscal 1992 was due to internal business
growth of 22%, sales resulting from the acquisition of Chapman Drug Company in
October 1991 (see Note 3 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"), and
the full consolidation of the Company's repackaging operation.  The internal
business growth in both fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993 resulted primarily from the
addition of new customers (partially as a result of expanded sales
territories), increased sales to existing customers, and price increases.

        GROSS MARGIN.  As a percentage of net sales, gross margin declined to
6.13% in fiscal 1994 from 6.42% in fiscal 1993 and 6.98% in fiscal 1992.  The
decreases in the gross margin percentages were due to (a) lower selling margin
rates, reflecting a more competitive market and a greater mix of higher volume
customers, where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management and
cash flow enabled the Company to offer lower selling margins, and (b) reduced
purchasing gains associated with lower drug price inflation.  The reduced
purchasing gains were partially offset by a lower LIFO charge.  The Company
expects the decline in gross margin rates to continue, but at a more moderate
rate.  

        SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general, and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales have improved consistently
from 5.01% in fiscal 1992 to 4.40% in fiscal 1993 and 4.03% in fiscal 1994.
The improvements are due primarily to economies associated with the Company's
significant sales growth, particularly with major customers where support costs
are generally lower, and to productivity improvements.

        UNUSUAL ITEMS.  In February 1994, the Company recorded a nonrecurring
charge to reflect estimated Whitmire Merger costs of approximately $35.9
million ($28.2 million net of tax), including (a) fees and other transaction
costs related to the combination, and (b) other nonrecurring costs expected to
be incurred in connection with the integration of Cardinal's and Whitmire's
business operations.  These estimated costs include approximately $7 million
for investment banking, legal, accounting, and other related transaction fees
and costs associated with the combination; $13 million for corporate
restructuring and distribution rationalization; $6 million for integration of
information systems; and $2 million for restructuring Whitmire's revolving
credit agreement.  Of these estimated costs, approximately $7 million pertain
to the revaluation of certain operating assets and $2 million pertain to
employee relocation, retraining and termination costs.  Certain of these
amounts are based on a preliminary estimate of costs to be incurred by the
Company, and actual costs may differ from such estimate.  At June 30, 1994, the
Company had incurred actual costs aggregating approximately $11.7 million
relative to the Whitmire Merger.  The current estimates of merger costs
ultimately to be incurred are not materially different than the amounts
originally recorded.

        During fiscal 1993, the Company received a termination fee of
approximately $13.5 million resulting from the termination by Durr-Fillauer
Medical, Inc. of its agreement to merge with the Company.  Also during fiscal
1993, the Company recorded nonrecurring charges totaling approximately $13.7
million, primarily related to the closing of certain non-core operations and
the rationalization, standardization and improvement of selected distribution
operations, information systems and support functions.  The charges included
the write-down of certain assets, moving costs and other costs associated with
the affected operations, and modification costs necessary to centralize and
standardize certain information systems and support functions. At June 30,
1994, the Company had incurred actual costs aggregating approximately $9.1
million related to these charges and expects most of the remaining amounts to
be incurred in fiscal 1995.  The modification of the terms of certain Whitmire
stock options in fiscal 1993 also resulted in a one-time stock option
compensation charge of approximately $5.2 million (see Note 11 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements").

        In fiscal 1992, the completion by Whitmire of certain equity
transactions resulted in the recording of an unusual expense of approximately
$2.0 million (see Note 11 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").

                                      12
<PAGE>   13



        INTEREST EXPENSE.  The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 1994
compared to fiscal 1993 is due primarily to the following: (a) the conversion
of debt to equity following the call for redemption, effective July 2, 1993, of
the Company's $75 million face amount of 7.25% Convertible Debentures due 2015
(the "Subordinated Debentures") (see Note 5 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements"), and (b) reduced borrowings under Whitmire's revolving credit
agreements.  The reductions in interest expense as discussed above were
partially offset by (a) increased interest expense resulting from the sale by
the Company of $100 million of 6.5% Notes due 2004 (the "New Notes") on
February 23, 1994 (see Note 5 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"),
and (b) increased average short-term borrowings (see Note 4 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements").  The increased average short-term
borrowings were a result of (a) increased working capital requirements, (b) the
repayment of amounts outstanding under Whitmire's revolving credit agreements
at the time of the Whitmire Merger (see Note 5 of "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements"), and (c) the redemption of Whitmire's preferred stock
(see Note 10 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").

        Additional interest expense recognized in fiscal 1993 compared to
fiscal 1992 relating to the issuance of the Company's $100 million 8% Notes due
1997 (the "Notes") on March 11, 1992, was primarily offset by (a) the use of
the proceeds of the Notes to reduce short-term borrowings, and (b) lower
average interest rates on amounts borrowed under Whitmire's revolving credit
agreements.  Fiscal 1992 interest expense also includes a charge of
approximately $1.8 million associated with the replacement of a 
Whitmire credit agreement (see Note 5 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements").

        The Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements
which serve to hedge the Notes (see Note 5 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements").  The net effect of the swap agreements is that the Company
exchanged its 8% fixed rate position on the Notes for a fixed rate of 5.1% for
the period July 15, 1992, through March 1, 1993, a fixed rate of 6.5% for the
period March 2, 1993, through March 1, 1994, and, thereafter, a fixed rate of
8.1% through March 1, 1997 (the maturity date of the Notes).  In May 1993, two
of the offsetting swap agreements were canceled at no gain or loss to the
Company.

        PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  The Company's provision for income taxes
relative to pretax earnings increased significantly in fiscal 1994 compared to
fiscal 1993 due primarily to (a) certain nondeductible costs associated with
the Whitmire Merger recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 1994 (see Note 2 of
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"), (b) the reduction of income from
tax-advantaged investments, and (c) the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act's 1% tax rate increase enacted on August 11, 1993, retroactive to January
1, 1993.

        CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE.  Effective at the
beginning of fiscal 1993, Cardinal adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109).  The cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 ($10 million) by Cardinal has been reported as
a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of fiscal 1993.
The $10 million cumulative effect recorded by Cardinal resulted primarily from
the fact that SFAS No. 109 modifies the accounting for business combinations
recorded using the purchase method.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No.
109 by Whitmire was not material and has been included in the fiscal 1992
provision for income taxes, and not presented separately in the consolidated
statement of earnings.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        Net working capital increased to $471.1 million at June 30, 1994, from
$440.7 million at March 31, 1993, and included increased investments in
merchandise inventories and trade receivables of $233.1 million and $92.5
million respectively, offset primarily by (a) an increase in accounts payable
of $219.7 million, (b) a reduction in cash and equivalents and marketable
securities of $49.1 million, and (c) an increase in notes payable-banks of
$25.0 million.  The increases in merchandise inventories and accounts payable
primarily reflect the timing of seasonal purchases and related payments.  The
increase in trade receivables was due primarily to increased sales (see "Net
Sales", above).  The decrease in cash and marketable securities and the
increase in notes payable-banks resulted primarily from (a) the increased
investments in merchandise inventories and trade receivables (net of the
increase in accounts payable) as described above, (b) the repayment of amounts
outstanding under Whitmire's revolving credit arrangements at the time of the
Whitmire Merger (approximately $120 million, including a prepayment penalty of
approximately $1.2 million), and (c) the redemption of Whitmire's preferred
stock (approximately $20.4 million).

        Long-term obligations decreased from $275.8 million at March 31, 1993,
to $210.1 million at June 30, 1994, due primarily to (a) the issuance by the
Company of additional Class A Common Shares upon the conversion of $74.9
million of the Subordinated Debentures, and (b) the repayment of amounts
outstanding under Whitmire's revolving credit arrangements, offset primarily by
the sale of the $100 million New Notes described above.

        Shareholders' equity increased to $368.5 million at June 30, 1994 from
$247.9 million at March 31, 1993 due primarily to (a) the issuance of
additional Class A Common Shares upon conversion of $74.9 million of the
Subordinated Debentures, offset by approximately $1.8 million of unamortized
debenture offering costs charged to shareholders' equity, (b) net earnings of
the Company of approximately $35.1 million in fiscal 1994 and net earnings of
approximately $7.8 million by Cardinal (exclusive of Whitmire) in the three
months ended June 30, 1993 (see Note 1 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements"), and (c) the issuance of approximately 1,062,000 Class A Common
Shares to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Solomons Company (see Note 3
of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"), offset primarily by (i) the
repurchase of approximately 725,000 Class A Common Shares owned by subsidiaries
of North American National Corporation (see Note 15 of "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements"), and (ii) dividends paid by the Company of approximately
$3.9 million in fiscal 1994.

        The Company has line-of-credit agreements with various bank sources
aggregating $321 million, of which $100 million is represented by committed
line-of-credit agreements and the balance is uncommitted.  The Company had
drawn upon $25 million of the available lines-of-credit at June 30, 1994,
leaving $296 million available under the Company's existing line-of-credit
agreements.

        On May 6, 1993, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a Registration Statement for the public offering, from time-to-time,
of its debt securities (the "Debt Securities") issuable in one or more series
in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $150 million.  On February 23,
1994, the Company sold $100 million of the New Notes (see Note 5 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements"), the net proceeds of which were used for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of the bank lines of credit
incurred as part of the Whitmire Merger.  At June 30, 1994, $50 million of the
Debt Securities remain issuable.

        On August 17, 1994, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a registration statement for an underwritten public offering of
5,250,000 Class A Common Shares.  Of the 5,250,000 shares, 1,600,000 are being
sold by the Company and 3,650,000 are being sold by certain shareholders of the
Company.  The underwriters have been granted an option to purchase up to
787,500 additional Class A Common Shares to cover overallotments, if any,
including up to 266,949 such shares from the Company.

                                      14
<PAGE>   15





        The Company believes that it has adequate capital resources at its
disposal (exclusive of the anticipated proceeds from the proposed public
offering of Class A Common Shares described above) to meet currently
anticipated capital expenditures, routine business growth and expansion, and
current and projected debt service, including the additional liquidity and
capital requirements associated with recent and prospective business
combinations (see Notes 3 and 16 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements").

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Shareholders and Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and March 31, 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1994, March 31, 1993 and March 31,
1992. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 14.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.  The consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule give retroactive effect to the
pooling-of-interests business combination of Cardinal Health, Inc. and Whitmire
Distribution Corporation on February 7, 1994, as described in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements.  We did not audit the balance sheet of
Whitmire Distribution Corporation as of July 3, 1993, or the related statements
of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows of Whitmire Distribution
Corporation for the years ended July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, which
statements reflect total assets of $451,855,000 as of July 3, 1993; net sales
of $2,666,829,000 and $2,033,067,000 for the years ended July 3, 1993 and June
27, 1992, respectively; and net earnings available for common shares before
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $4,039,000 and $330,000
for the years ended July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, respectively.  Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to
us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Whitmire
Distribution Corporation in the March 31, 1993 and 1992 financial statements,
is based solely on the report of such other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits and the report of other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cardinal Health, Inc. and
subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and March 31, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1994, March 31,
1993, and March 31, 1992 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes to conform with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 by applying it retroactively effective
April 1, 1992.

CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- - ------------------------------------------

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The Company is a full service wholesaler distributing a broad line of
     pharmaceuticals, surgical and hospital supplies, health and beauty care
     products, and other items typically sold by hospitals, retail drug stores,
     and other health care providers.  The Company is currently operating in
     only one business segment.
        
     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
     of all majority-owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany
     amounts have been eliminated.  The consolidated financial statements have
     been prepared to give retroactive effect to the pooling-of-interests
     business combination with Whitmire Distribution Corporation (the "Whitmire
     Merger") on February 7, 1994 (see Note 3).  The term "Cardinal," as used
     herein, refers to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the
     Whitmire Merger.  Cardinal's fiscal year has historically ended on March
     31, while Whitmire's fiscal year has ended on the Saturday closest to the
     end of June.  On March 1, 1994, the Company changed its fiscal year end
     from March 31 to June 30.  Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated
     financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, and for the
     twelve months ended June 30, 1993, combine the information for Cardinal
     and Whitmire as of June 30, 1994, and for each of the two years then
     ended. The accompanying consolidated financial statements for earlier
     fiscal years combine information for Cardinal's March year end with
     Whitmire's subsequent fiscal June year end.  The consolidated statement of
     earnings for the twelve months ended June 30, 1993, is unaudited and is
     presented for the purpose of supplemental analysis.
        
     Due to the different fiscal period ends of the merged companies, the
     results of Whitmire for the three months ended July 3, 1993, have been
     included in the consolidated statements of earnings for both the periods
     ended June 30, 1993, and March 31, 1993.  Cardinal's results of operations
     (exclusive of Whitmire) for the three months ended June 30, 1993, are not
     included in the consolidated statement of earnings but have been included
     as an adjustment in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.
     Such amounts, along with certain cash flow information, are summarized as
     follows (in thousands):

  MARKETABLE SECURITIES

  Marketable securities are recorded at cost, which approximates market value.

  TRADE RECEIVABLES

  Trade receivables are presented net of the related allowance for doubtful
  accounts of approximately $21,594,000 and $13,428,000 at June 30, 1994, and
  March 31, 1993, respectively.

  MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

  Substantially all merchandise inventories are stated at lower of cost,
  last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.  If the Company had used the
  first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates
  current replacement cost, inventories would have been higher than reported at
  June 30, 1994, by $61,852,000 and at March 31, 1993, by $55,374,000.  The
  impact of partial inventory liquidations in certain LIFO pools reduced the
  LIFO provision by approximately $2,500,000 in fiscal 1993.

  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

  Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation and amortization for
  financial reporting purposes are computed using the straight-line method
  over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to forty
  years, including capital lease assets which are amortized over the terms of
  their respective leases.  Amortization of capital lease assets is included in
  depreciation and amortization expense.

  OTHER ASSETS

  Other assets primarily represent intangible assets related to the excess of
  cost over net assets of subsidiaries acquired and noncurrent deferred tax
  assets (see Note 7).  Intangible assets are being amortized using the
  straight-line method over lives which range from ten to forty years.
  Accumulated amortization was $16,571,000 and $15,369,000 at June 30, 1994,
  and March 31, 1993, respectively.  At each balance sheet date, a
  determination is made by management to ascertain whether the intangible
  assets have been impaired based on several criteria, including, but not
  limited to, sales trends, undiscounted operating cash flows, and other
  operating factors.

  SALES RECOGNITION

  The Company records sales when merchandise is delivered to its customers and
  the Company has no further obligation to provide services related to
  merchandise delivered.  Service fees related to bulk sales of pharmaceuticals
  are included in net sales.  Such amounts are not significant in fiscal 1994,
  1993 and 1992.

  INCOME TAXES

  Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 1993, Cardinal began accounting
  for income taxes under the liability method by adopting Statement of
  Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
  (SFAS No. 109).  The cumulative effect of adopting this statement
  ($10,000,000) has been reported as a change in accounting principle
  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal 1993.  The cumulative effect of
  adopting SFAS No. 109 by Whitmire was not material and has been included in
  the fiscal 1992 provision for income taxes, and not separately presented in
  the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Prior to the adoption of
  SFAS No. 109, both Cardinal and Whitmire accounted for income taxes in
  accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11.  

                                      23

     CAPITAL STOCK

     The Company's authorized capital shares consist of:  (a) 60,000,000 common
     shares, without par value ("Class A Common Shares"), of which at June 30,
     1994, 34,862,835 were outstanding; (b) 5,000,000 Class B common shares,
     without par value ("Class B Common Shares"), of which at June 30, 1994,
     2,971,375 were outstanding; and (c) 500,000 non-voting preferred shares
     without par value ("Preferred Shares"), none of which has been issued. 
     The Class B Common Shares were issued to a former Whitmire stockholder in
     February 1994 in connection with the Whitmire Merger.  All of the  
     outstanding Class B Common Shares are held by one holder.
        
     All holders of Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares
     (collectively, "Common Shares") participate equally in dividends when and
     as declared by the Company's Board of Directors.  Holders of Class A
     Common Shares are entitled to one vote per share for the election of
     Directors and upon all matters on which shareholders are entitled to vote. 
     Holders of Class B Common Shares are entitled to one-fifth of one vote per
     share in the election of Directors and upon all matters which shareholders
     are entitled to vote.
        
     EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

     Primary earnings per Common Share are based on the weighted average number
     of Common Shares outstanding during each period and the dilutive effect of
     stock options and warrants from the date of grant computed using the
     treasury stock method.
        
     Fully diluted earnings per Common Share reflect:  (a) the dilutive effect
     of stock options and warrants from the date of grant computed using the
     treasury stock method; and (b) the full conversion of the 7.25%
     Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015 through their conversion and
     redemption in July 1993 (see Note 5).

     The Company paid a 25% stock dividend on June 30, 1994, to effect a
     five-for-four stock split of the Company's Common Shares.  All share and
     per share amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,
     except the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity, have been
     adjusted to reflect this stock split.
        
2.   UNUSUAL ITEMS

     In February 1994, the Company recorded a nonrecurring charge to reflect
     estimated Whitmire Merger costs of approximately $35.9 million ($28.2
     million net of tax), including (a) fees and other transaction costs
     related to the combination, and (b) other nonrecurring costs expected to
     be incurred in connection with the integration of Cardinal's and
     Whitmire's business operations.  These estimated costs include
     approximately $7 million for investment banking, legal, accounting, and
     other related transaction fees and costs associated with the combination;
     $13 million for corporate restructuring and distribution rationalization;
     $6 million for integration of information systems; and $2 million for
     restructuring Whitmire's revolving credit agreement.  Of these estimated
     costs, approximately $7 million pertain to the revaluation of certain
     operating assets and $2 million pertain to employee relocation, retraining
     and termination costs.  Certain of these amounts are based on a
     preliminary estimate of costs to be incurred by the Company, and actual
     costs may differ from such estimate.  At June 30, 1994, the Company had
     incurred actual costs aggregating approximately $11.7 million relating to
     the Whitmire Merger.  The Company's current estimates of merger costs
     ultimately to be incurred are not materially different than the amounts
     originally recorded.

<PAGE>   25
     During fiscal 1993, the Company received a termination fee of
     approximately $13.5 million, resulting from the termination by
     Durr-Fillauer Medical, Inc. of its agreement to merge with the Company. 
     Also during fiscal 1993, the Company recorded nonrecurring charges
     totaling approximately $13.7 million, primarily related to the closing of
     certain non-core operations and the rationalization, standardization and
     improvement of selected distribution operations, information systems and
     support functions.  The charges included the write-down of certain assets,
     moving costs and other costs associated with the affected operations, and
     modification costs necessary to centralize and standardize certain
     information systems and support functions.  At June 30, 1994, the Company
     had incurred actual costs aggregating approximately $9.1 million related
     to these charges and expects most of the remaining amounts to be incurred
     in fiscal 1995.  The modification of the terms of certain Whitmire stock
     options in fiscal 1993 also resulted in a one-time stock option
     compensation charge of approximately $5.2 million (see Note 11).
        
     In fiscal 1992, the completion by Whitmire of certain equity transactions
     resulted in the recording of an unusual expense of approximately $2.0
     million (see Note 11).
        
     The following supplemental information summarizes the results of
     operations of the Company, adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect (a)
     the elimination of the effect of the unusual items discussed above, and
     (b) the redemption of Whitmire's preferred stock pursuant to the terms of
     the Reorganization Agreement.  Solely for purposes of the summary
     presented below, such redemption is assumed to have been funded from the
     liquidation of investments in tax-exempt marketable securities.

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     On January 27, 1994, shareholders of Cardinal and Whitmire approved and
     adopted the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated October 11, 1993
     (the "Reorganization Agreement"), pursuant to which Cardinal Merger Corp.,
     a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal, was merged with and into Whitmire
     effective February 7, 1994.  In the merger, which was accounted for as a
     pooling-of-interests business combination, holders of outstanding Whitmire
     common stock received an aggregate of approximately 6,802,000  Class A
     Common Shares and approximately 1,861,000 Class B Common Shares in
     exchange for all of the previously outstanding common stock of Whitmire.
     In addition, Whitmire's outstanding stock options were converted into
     options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1,721,000 additional
     Class A Common Shares pursuant to the terms of such options and the
     Reorganization Agreement.

     On December 17, 1993, the Company issued approximately 296,000 Class A
     Common Shares in a merger transaction for all of the capital stock of PRN
     Services, Inc., a distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to
     oncologists and oncology clinics.  The transaction was accounted for as a
     pooling-of-interests business combination.  The impact of the PRN merger,
     on both an historical and pro forma basis, is not significant.
     Accordingly, prior periods have not been restated for the PRN merger.

     On May 4, 1993, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
     of Solomons Company, a wholesale drug distributor based in Savannah,
     Georgia, in exchange for approximately 1,062,000 Class A Common Shares.
     The transaction was accounted for by the purchase method.  Had the
     acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1993, operating results on
     a pro forma basis would not have been significantly different.

     On October 15, 1991, the Company acquired all of the issued and
     outstanding shares of Chapman Drug Company, a drug wholesaler based in
     Knoxville, Tennessee, for cash of $16,800,000 in a transaction accounted
     for by the purchase method.  Had the acquisition occurred at the beginning
     of fiscal 1992, operating results on a pro forma basis would not have been
     significantly different.



4.   NOTES PAYABLE - BANKS

     The Company has entered into various uncommitted line-of-credit
     arrangements which allow for borrowings up to $221,000,000 at various
     money market rates.  The amount outstanding under such arrangements as of
     June 30, 1994 was $25,000,000.

     In addition to the aforementioned credit arrangements, at June 30, 1994,
     the Company has revolving credit agreements with eight banks which have a
     maturity of less than one year, are renewable on a quarterly basis, and
     allow the Company to borrow up to $100,000,000 (none of which was in use
     at June 30, 1994) at either the prime rate, eurodollar rates plus .5%, or
     a mutually agreed upon rate.  The Company is required to pay a commitment
     fee at the annual rate of .125% on the average daily unused amounts of the
     total credit allowed under the revolving credit agreements.

     Total unused lines of credit at June 30, 1994 and March 31, 1993 were
     $296,000,000 and $176,000,000, respectively.

     On February 23, 1994, the Company sold $100,000,000 of 6.5% Notes due 2004
     (the "New Notes") in a public offering.  The New Notes represent unsecured
     obligations of the Company, are not redeemable prior to maturity and are
     not subject to a sinking fund.  Issuance costs of approximately $860,000
     incurred in connection with the offering are being amortized on a
     straight-line basis over the period the New Notes will be outstanding.
     The Company used the proceeds of this sale for general corporate purposes,
     including the repayment of bank lines of credit incurred as part of the
     Whitmire Merger (see Note 3).  In anticipation of the sale of the New
     Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate hedge agreement, which
     was terminated at the approximate time of the issuance of the New Notes,
     resulting in a deferred gain of approximately $1.3 million which will be
     amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the period the New Notes
     are outstanding.

     On March 11, 1992, the Company sold $100,000,000 of 8% Notes due 1997 (the
     "Notes") in a public offering.  The Notes represent unsecured obligations
     of the Company, are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject
     to a sinking fund.  Issuance costs of approximately $718,000 incurred in
     connection with the offering, are being amortized on a straight-line basis
     over the period the Notes will be outstanding.  


                                      27
<PAGE>   28
     The Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements which
     serve to hedge the Notes. The net effect of the swap agreements is that
     the Company exchanged its 8% fixed rate position on the Notes for a fixed
     rate of 5.1% for the period July 15, 1992, through March 1, 1993, a fixed
     rate of 6.5% for the period March 2, 1993, through March 1, 1994, and,
     thereafter, a fixed rate of 8.1% through March 1, 1997 (the maturity date
     of the Notes).  In May 1993, two of the offsetting swap agreements were
     canceled at no gain or loss to the Company.  Due to the offsetting nature
     of the swaps, the market value of those in a net receivable position
     approximates the market value of those in a net payable position.  The
     risk of accounting loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties
     is approximately $4 million as of June 30, 1994; however, based on the
     credit quality of the counterparties, the Company believes the     
     likelihood of such a credit loss to be remote.



     During fiscal 1992, the Company, through Whitmire, entered into a
     revolving credit agreement under which it could borrow up to $210,000,000.
     During fiscal 1993, the agreement was amended to provide for seasonal
     increases in the availability up to $235,000,000.  Interest was payable
     monthly at 1.5% over the prime rate or, at Whitmire's election, 3.25% over
     the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  The average interest rate
     under the revolving credit agreement at the end of fiscal 1993 was 6.9%.
     This agreement replaced a $175,000,000 credit agreement, and interest
     expense in fiscal 1992 includes a charge of $1,837,000 associated with
     this replacement.  On February 7, 1994, the revolving credit agreement was
     terminated.

     The Subordinated Debentures outstanding at March 31, 1993, were
     convertible into the Company's Class A Common Shares at any time on or
     before July 1, 2015, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of
     $17.51 per share.  Issuance costs of approximately $2,000,000 incurred in
     connection with the offering were being amortized on a straight-line basis
     over the original period the Subordinated Debentures were to be
     outstanding.  On June 11, 1993, the Company called the Subordinated
     Debentures for redemption, effective as of July 2, 1993.  Following this
     call, $74,920,000 of Subordinated Debentures outstanding as of March 31,
     1993, were converted into Class A Common Shares of the Company.  The
     remaining $80,000 of Subordinated Debentures outstanding as of March 31,
     1993, were redeemed for cash.  The pro forma primary earnings per share of
     the Company, as if the above conversion and redemption had occurred as of
     the beginning of fiscal 1992, would have been $0.80 and $0.74 in fiscal
     1993 and 1992, respectively.

     The amount credited to shareholders' equity as a result of the conversion
     of the Subordinated Debentures was reduced by unamortized offering costs
     of approximately $1,767,000 and costs directly related to the conversion
     of approximately $13,000.

     Certain long-term obligations are collateralized by property and equipment
     of the Company with an aggregate book value of approximately $13,500,000
     at June 30, 1994.

6.   DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
     of each material class of financial instruments for which estimates are
     practicable:


     CASH AND EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES

     The carrying amount at June 30, 1994, and March 31, 1993, approximates the
     fair value because of the short-term maturities of these items.
        

     LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS

     The Company's long-term obligations are composed of notes, a long-term
     revolving credit agreement, convertible debentures, and various mortgage
     revenue bonds, notes and capital leases.  The fair value of the Company's
     long-term obligations is estimated based on the quoted market prices for
     the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for debt
     of the same remaining maturities.
        
        
     Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop
     the estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein
     are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could
     realize in a current market exchange.  The fair values do not include
     early redemption premiums, underwriter's fees and commissions, and
     refunding costs (legal and registration fees).

     The estimated value of the Company's long-term obligations was
     $206,116,000 and $313,704,000, as compared to the carrying amounts of
     $213,015,000 and $281,225,000 at June 30, 1994, and March 31, 1993,
     respectively.

     The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent
     information available to management as of the dates indicated.  Although
     management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the
     estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
     revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date, and
     current estimates of fair values may differ significantly from the amounts
     presented herein.

7.   INCOME TAXES                      

     Effective the beginning of fiscal 1993, Cardinal adopted Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS
     No. 109).  Under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, income taxes are recorded
     under the liability method.  SFAS No. 109 results in the recognition of
     deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
     consequences of existing differences between financial reporting and tax
     reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), and
     operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.  The
     cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 ($10,000,000) by Cardinal has
     been reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the
     beginning of fiscal 1993.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109
     by Whitmire was not material and has been included in the fiscal 1992
     provision for income taxes, and not separately presented in the
     accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

     The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):

8.   EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

     Substantially all of the Company's non-union employees are enrolled in
     Company-sponsored contributory profit sharing and retirement savings plans
     which include features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code,
     and provide for matching Company contributions.  The Company's
     contributions to the plans are determined by the Board of Directors
     subject to certain minimum requirements as specified in the plans.

     Qualified union employees are covered by Company-sponsored and
     multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the provisions of
     collective bargaining agreements.  Benefits under these plans are
     generally based on the employee's years of service and average
     compensation at retirement.


     The effect of the Company-sponsored defined benefit plans on the Company's
     consolidated financial statements is not material.

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement No. 112,
     "Employer's Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" which requires
     employers to accrue for certain postemployment benefits provided to former
     or inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents after
     employment, but before retirement.  This change must be implemented by the
     Company in fiscal 1995.  Based upon preliminary estimates, management does
     not believe that the new statement will have a material effect on the
     consolidated financial statements of the Company.


9.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

     The Company leases certain warehouse and office facilities, vehicles, and
     data processing equipment under operating leases.  The leases expire at
     various dates over the next thirteen years.  Certain of these leases
     provide for renewal options and/or contingent rentals based on various
     factors.

     The minimum rental payments above have been reduced by sublease rentals of
     approximately $582,000 in 1995, $215,000 in 1996, $79,000 in 1997, and
     $12,000 in 1998.  Rental expense (net of sublease rental income) relating
     to operating leases and short-term cancelable leases was approximately
     $11,189,000, $10,316,000 and $8,990,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992,
     respectively.

     In connection with its supplier relationship with various customers, the
     Company has guaranteed certain indebtedness and lease payments.  As of
     June 30, 1994, these guarantees total approximately $2,251,000.

     During fiscal 1994, the Company began a program whereby certain customer
     notes receivables were sold, with full recourse, to a commercial bank.  As
     of June 30, 1994, amounts outstanding on customer notes receivables sold
     to the commercial bank under this program totaled approximately $6.7
     million.


     The Company becomes involved from time-to-time in litigation arising out
     of its normal business activities.  In addition, in November 1993,
     Cardinal, Whitmire, five other pharmaceutical wholesalers, and twenty-four
     pharmaceutical manufacturers were named as defendants in a series of
     purported class action antitrust lawsuits alleging violations of various
     antitrust laws associated with the chargeback pricing system.  The Company
     believes that the allegations set forth against Cardinal and Whitmire in
     these lawsuits are without merit.  In the opinion of management, the
     Company's liability, if any, under any pending litigation would not have a
     material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.


10.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK


     The Company had authorized 360,000 shares of redeemable preferred $.01
     par value stock in Whitmire.  The redeemable preferred stock was divided
     into two series:  350,000 shares designated as Senior Preferred Stock and
     10,000 shares designated as Series A Preferred Stock.


                                      32
<PAGE>   33
     The holders of the Whitmire redeemable preferred stock were entitled to
     cumulative annual dividends of $10.00 per share for Senior Preferred Stock
     and $10.125 for Series A Preferred Stock when and as declared by
     Whitmire's board of directors.  In lieu of paying cash dividends to the
     holders of Senior Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, Whitmire
     could, at its election, pay scheduled dividends with additional shares of
     Senior Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as appropriate.

     Whitmire would have been required to redeem, at $100.00 per share plus
     accrued but unpaid dividends, all shares of its Senior and Series A
     Preferred Stock commencing in October 1994 through July 1996.
     Stockholders' equity was charged $840,000 in each of fiscal 1993 and 1992
     for accretion relative to this mandatory redemption obligation.  As of
     March 31, 1993, a total of $4,200,000 had been credited to redeemable
     preferred stock through accretion.  Pursuant to the terms of the
     Reorganization Agreement between Cardinal and Whitmire (see Note 3), all
     of the outstanding shares of Senior and Series A Preferred Stock were
     redeemed as  of February 7, 1994, the date of the Whitmire Merger.


11.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     During fiscal 1992, the Company, through Whitmire, completed a series
     of transactions which affected its capitalization as follows: warrants for
     the purchase of Whitmire common stock were returned and canceled; options
     were granted for the benefit of key employees to purchase shares of
     Whitmire common stock; outside investors were granted adjustment share
     rights representing rights to purchase shares of Whitmire common stock (a
     defined percentage of the adjustment share rights were cancelable
     annually, up to 100%, based upon the achievement of certain financial
     targets); shares of Whitmire's Series A Preferred Stock were issued to
     certain outside investors as reimbursement of expenses incurred in
     connection with their ownership interest; and put and call provisions of
     certain outstanding warrants were canceled. The fiscal 1992 consolidated 
     statement of earnings reflects an expense associated with the above
     transactions of approximately $2.0 million.

     During fiscal 1993,  the adjustment share rights were canceled and certain
     conditions relative to the exercise of options were eliminated.  For
     financial reporting purposes, the modification of the terms of these
     options has been treated as if the options were issued on the date that
     the terms were modified.  Accordingly,  a compensation charge totaling
     approximately $5.2 million was recorded relative to these changes.  The
     compensation charge is equal to the fair value (as determined by an
     independent appraisal) of the options on the date that the terms of the
     options were modified.

     Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Agreement (see Note 3),
     warrants to purchase shares of Whitmire common stock which, upon exercise
     became convertible into approximately 2,831,000 Common Shares at an
     average price of $.08 per share, were exercised prior to the consummation
     of the pooling-of-interests business combination of Cardinal and Whitmire.


12.  STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES

     The Company maintains stock incentive plans (the "Plans") for the benefit
     of certain officers, directors and key employees.  Under the Plans, at
     June 30, 1994, the Company was authorized to issue up to an aggregate of
     approximately 3,875,000 Class A Common Shares in the form of incentive
     stock options, nonqualified stock options, and restricted shares.  Options
     granted are generally exercisable for periods up to ten years from the
     date of grant at a price approximating fair market value at the date of
     grant.

</TABLE>


     At June 30, 1994, approximately 389,000 option shares under the Plans were
     exercisable and approximately 2,919,000 Class A Common Shares were
     reserved for issuance under the Plans.

     In connection with a 1988 acquisition, the Company issued options for
     approximately 133,000 Class A Common Shares at $7.45 per share.  All of
     these options were exercised in fiscal 1993.

     In connection with the Whitmire Merger, outstanding Whitmire stock options
     granted to current or former Whitmire officers or employees were
     automatically converted into options ("Cardinal Exchange Options") to
     purchase an aggregate of approximately 1,721,000 additional Cardinal Class
     A Common Shares pursuant to the terms of such options and the
     Reorganization Agreement (see Note 3).  Under the terms of their original
     issuance and as reflected in the Reorganization Agreement, the exercise
     price for substantially all of the Cardinal Exchange Options is remitted
     to certain former investors of Whitmire.  During fiscal 1994, Cardinal
     Exchange Options to purchase approximately 271,000 shares were exercised
     with an average option price of $1.60 per share.  At June 30, 1994,
     Cardinal Exchange Options to purchase approximately 1,450,000 shares were
     outstanding with an average exercise price of $1.60 per share.
     Substantially all of the Cardinal Exchange Options outstanding at June 30,
     1994, are 100% vested and are exercisable through October 25, 1995.


     The market value of restricted shares awarded by the Company is recorded
     as unamortized restricted stock awards and shown as a separate component
     of shareholders' equity.  The compensation awards are amortized to expense
     over the period in which participants perform services, generally four to
     seven years.  As of June 30, 1994, approximately 414,000 restricted shares
     have been issued, of which approximately 195,000 shares remain restricted
     and subject to forfeiture and approximately 16,000 shares have been
     forfeited.


                                                                34

13.  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING
     ACTIVITIES

     Capital lease obligations of $906,000, $648,000 and $2,130,000 were
     incurred in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, as a result of the Company
     entering into leases for equipment.

     $6,275,000 in fiscal 1992 and $4,315,000 in the three months ended June
     30, 1993, and is included as part of the amount of liabilities assumed.

     In conjunction with the pooling-of-interests combination with PRN (see
     Note 3) in fiscal 1994, the historical cost of PRN assets combined was
     approximately $16,946,000, and the total PRN liabilities assumed
     (including total debt of approximately $5,847,000) were approximately
     $16,564,000.

     The following supplemental information, presented to show the seasonal
     trend of earnings, reflects the selected quarterly financial data on the
     basis of consolidating the same calendar quarters for Cardinal and
     Whitmire, excludes the impact of unusual items (see Note 2) and assumes the
     redemption of Whitmire's preferred stock.  Solely for purposes of the
     supplemental information presented below, such redemption is assumed to
     have been funded from the liquidation of investments in tax-exempt
     marketable securities.

15.  COMMON SHARES REPURCHASE

     On April 14, 1993, the Company repurchased all of the Class A Common Shares
     (approximately 725,000) owned by subsidiaries of North American National
     Corporation, the former Chairman of which is also a Director of the
     Company, at a price of $21.20 per share.  Nearly all of these shares were
     subject to certain restrictions contained in a Shareholders Agreement among
     North American National Corporation and other individual shareholders,
     which restrictions were released as part of the repurchase transaction.
        

16.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
  
     On July 1, 1994, the Company purchased all of the common stock of
     Humiston-Keeling, Inc. in a transaction to be accounted for by the
     purchase method.  Humiston-Keeling is a Calumet City, Illinois based
     wholesale drug distributor with annualized revenues of approximately $330
     million.

     On July 18, 1994, the Company issued Class A Common Shares in exchange for
     all of the common shares of Behrens Inc. in a transaction to be accounted
     for as a pooling-of-interests business combination.  The impact of the
     Behrens combination, on both an historical and pro forma basis, is not
     significant.  Accordingly, prior periods will not be restated for the
     Behrens combination.  Behrens is a Waco, Texas based wholesale drug
     distributor with annualized revenues of approximately $185 million.

     On August 17, 1994, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange
     Commission a registration statement for an underwritten public offering of
     5,250,000 Class A Common Shares.  Of the 5,250,000 shares, 1,600,000 are
     being sold by the Company and 3,650,000 are being sold by certain
     shareholders of the Company.  The underwriters have been granted an option
     to purchase up to 787,500 additional Class A Common Shares to cover
     overallotments, including up to 266,949 such shares from the Company.  The
     net proceeds payable to the Company will be used to finance working
     capital growth and for other general corporate purposes.

(1)  Prior to the Whitmire Merger, Mr. Whitmire held options to purchase 51,002 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value,
     of Whitmire. In connection with the Whitmire Merger, these options were automatically converted into options to 
     purchase 532,333 Class A Common Shares of the Company (as adjusted to reflect the Company's 5-for-4 stock split paid
     June 30, 1994).
</TABLE>


EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
- - ----------------------
   In connection with the Whitmire Merger, Messrs. Whitmire, Clare and Close
each entered into an employment agreement with Whitmire, the performance of
which was guaranteed by the Company. The employment agreements provide for an
employment term of three years commencing February 7, 1994, and payment of a
base salary of $275,000 for Mr. Whitmire, $98,400 for Mr. Clare and $180,000 for
Mr. Close, such base salaries to be reviewed for possible increase at least
annually. The agreements also provide for an annual bonus payable in accordance
with the bonus plan in which other Company executive officers participate from
time to time. The emplyment agreements provide that individual parties to the
employment agreements will be entitled to participate in group health, life,
disability insurance, retirement savings and other employee benefit plans which
are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to either (i) Whitmire's group
benefit plans in effect at the time of the Whitmire Merger or (ii) the group
benefit plans maintained from time to time by the Company in which the other
executives of the Company participate. In addition, the employment agreements
contain noncompete covenants effective throughout the employment term, and for
up to two additional one year periods following the employment term (the
"Extension Period"). As consideration for his noncompete covenants, Mr. Whitmire
will receive two consecutive annual payments of $600,000 each, with the first
such payment to be paid on the 30th day after the earlier of the termination of
Mr. Whitmire's employment or February 7, 1999. As consideration for their
respective noncompete covenants following the termination of their employment
with the Company, each of Messrs. Clare and Close may, if the noncompete
covenants are triggered during the Extension Period by the Company, at its
election, continue to receive during the Extension Period base salary, 50% of
their bonus target, and participation in certain group benefit plans.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
- - -------------------------
   The Company's non-employee Directors are paid $2,000 per quarter plus $1,000
for each Board meeting attended. Non-employee Directors are also entitled to
receive $600 for each Committee meeting attended. Employee Directors do not
receive compensation in their capacity as a Director.

   Pursuant to the Company's Directors' Stock Option Plan, as amended (the
"Directors' Option Plan"), options to purchase that number of Class A Common
Shares having a fair market value of $50,000 on the date of grant are
automatically granted on an annual basis to each non-employee Director who has
served as such for three consecutive annual meetings.  The exercise price of
these options is the fair market value of the Class A Common Shares on the date
of grant.  In addition, options to purchase that number of Class A Common
Shares having a fair market value of $100,000 on the date of grant are
automatically made to each non-employee Director subsequently added to the
Board. The exercise price of these options is the fair market value of Class A
Common Shares on the date of grant.  All grants under the Directors' Option
Plan vest immediately, are exerciseable for ten years from the date of grant,
and are subject to adjustment for subsequent stock dividends, splits, and other
changes in the Company's capital structure.  If a Director ceases to serve as
such, then options previously granted under the Directors' Option Plan lapse
unless exercised within six months (twelve months in the case of a Director's
death).  Options granted under the Directors' Option Plan are treated as
"nonqualified options" under the Code.
 
   The Company has entered into Indemnification Agreements with each of its
Directors.  See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--
Indemnification Agreements."

 (1) Mr. Walter's address is 655 Metro Place South, Suite 925, Dublin, Ohio
     43017.  Mr. Walter, Edward D. Esping and members of his family (the
     "Espings"),  and Mr. Moritz are parties to a Shareholders Agreement dated
     July 13, 1984, as amended (the "Shareholders Agreement"), pursuant to
     which they have agreed to act jointly in voting certain Class A Common
     Shares (the "Pooled Shares") owned by each of them in a manner determined
     desirable by the holders of a majority of the Pooled Shares.  The Pooled
     Shares are owned as follows:  Mr. Walter - 2,525,146 shares; the
     Espings - 173,505 shares; and Mr. Moritz - 528,428 shares.  Since Mr.
     Walter owns a majority of the Pooled Shares, he controls the voting of the
     Pooled Shares.  The Pooled Shares are subject to a right of first refusal
     in favor of the owners of the remaining Pooled Shares.  The terms of the
     Shareholders Agreement will continue through September 14, 1999, unless
     earlier terminated by, among other things, the decision by then-holders of
     a majority of the Pooled Shares, any event which results in Mr. Walter not
     owning a majority of the Pooled Shares, or the release from the
     Shareholders Agreement of more than 50% of the original Pooled Shares.
     Mr. Walter has sole investment power with respect to the 2,525,146 Pooled
     Shares he owns of record and, as a result of the Shareholders Agreement,
     he has shared voting power with respect to all the Pooled Shares (which
     include such 2,525,146 shares).

 (2) Bank One Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee of separate trusts (the
     "Walter Trusts") for the benefit of each of Mr. Walter's three children.
     Each such trust owns 45,897 Class A Common Shares. Class A Common Shares
     listed as being beneficially owned by Mr. Walter exclude the 137,691 Class
     A Common Shares owned by the Walter Trusts, and Mr. Walter disclaims
     beneficial ownership of such Class A Common Shares.

     (5)). As a result of the Company's merger with Whitmire Distribution 
     Corporation in February 1994 (the "Whitmire Merger"), Apollo has the right
     to designate two nominees for election as Directors of the Company for so 
     long as (A) Apollo, including any of its affiliates and any of its
     accounts under common management and control (the "Apollo Group"), and
     (B) any former shareholder of Whitmire (exclusive of Apollo Advisors, L.P.
     and any such shareholders who were current or former employees of Whitmire 
     as of October 11, 1993,  or any family members of such employees or trusts
     for their benefit ("Management Shareholders")) each continue to have a
     pecuniary interest in 1,250,000 or more Common Shares issued to such 
     person in the Whitmire Merger (the "Threshold Amount"). Further, Apollo
     Advisors, L.P. has the right to designate one individual for so long as
     only one of the Apollo Group or any former shareholder of Whitmire
     (exclusive of Apollo Advisors, L.P. or Management Shareholders) shall
     continue to have a pecuniary interest in a number of Common Shares which
     equals or exceeds the Threshold Amount. In connection with the Whitmire 
     Merger, Apollo designated  Messrs. Gross and Blutt as nominees for 
     Directors of the Company and they were elected by the Company's
     shareholders. In addition, until the Apollo Group no longer has
     a pecuniary interest in a number of Common Shares equal to or exceeding 
     the Threshold Amount, the Company  must include as a member of its Audit 
     Committee one Director designated by the Apollo Group and, if Mr.Whitmire
     ceases to be a member of the Company's Executive Committee, one Director 
     designated by the Apollo Group on the Company's Executive Committee.

     Class A Common Shares beneficially owned by Apollo, CEA or Banc One
     (including the 137,691 Class A Common Shares owned by the Walter Trusts).

ITEM 13: CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
- - -------------------------------------------------------
BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
- - ---------------------
    A property which includes parts of the Company's former Columbus food
distribution center is leased by the Company from a limited partnership in
which the general partner is Mr. Walter and the limited partners include
certain shareholders and directors of the Company or their affiliates.  The
Company has subleased this property to third parties at rentals substantially
in excess of the rentals it is required to pay.  The initial term of the
Company's lease expired February 29, 1984, and the lease is currently in its
second ten-year renewal term.  The Company has options to renew the lease for
two additional ten-year terms.  The rent payable by the Company is $92,000 per
annum during each of the first two renewal terms, and the fair rental value of
the premises during each of the last two renewal terms.  The Company has a
first- refusal option to purchase the premises in the event the lessor proposes
to sell the premises to a third party.  See also, "Executive Compensation -
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation."

    In the opinion of management, the transactions described above are on
terms at least as favorable as could be obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

below received either Class A Common Shares or Class B Common Shares of the
Company in exchange for Whitmire common stock or Whitmire class B common stock
(including Whitmire stock acquired upon the exercise of warrants):

<FN>
         (1)  At the time of the Whitmire Merger, the Whitmire stock was held
             of record by M.D. investors, L.P. ("MD"), a limited partnership
             whose general partner was Apollo and whose limited partner was
             CEA.  Shortly following the Whitmire Merger, MD was dissolved and
             the Common Shares of the Company issued in the Whitmire Merger
             were distributed to MD's partners.  The numbers shown in the table
             above reflect the Common Shares held by Apollo and CEA following
             the dissolution of MD.

</TABLE>

         CONVERSION OF OPTIONS

         In connection with the Whitmire Merger, options to purchase Whitmire
common stock were automatically converted into options to purchase a number of
Class A Common Shares equal to the number of shares of Whitmire common stock
issuable immediately prior to the Whitmire Merger multiplied by the exchange
ratio used for the Whitmire Merger.  Accordingly, options to purchase Whitmire
common stock held by Messrs.  Whitmire, Close and Clare were converted into
options to purchase Class A Common Shares of the Company ("Cardinal Exchange
Options") at exercise prices ranging from less than $.01 to $2.20 per share as
follows:  Mr. Whitmire -- 532,333 shares; Mr. Close -- 146,125 shares; Mr.
Clare -- 52,187 shares.


         REDEMPTION OF WHITMIRE PREFERRED STOCK

         Immediately prior to the completion of the Whitmire Merger, and as a
condition to such completion, Whitmire redeemed all of its issued and
outstanding Senior Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock at the
redemption price of $100 per share, plus cumulated and unpaid dividends,
resulting in redemption payments to MD and CEA of $13,598,000 and $6,558,000,
respectively.  As described above, MD was dissolved shortly following the
Whitmire Merger.  Of the $13,598,000 in redemption payments to MD, $10,200,182
was for the benefit of Apollo and $3,398,248 was for the benefit of CEA.


                                                                51
<PAGE>   52
         WHITMIRE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

         In connection with the Whitmire Merger, the Company granted to Apollo,
CEA, and Mr. Whitmire (collectively, the "Whitmire Stockholders") certain
rights to require the Company to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act") Class A Common Shares held by them (including
Class A Common Shares issuable to CEA upon conversion of Class B Common
Shares).  These rights include "demand" and "piggyback" registration rights and
are contained in the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October 11,
1993, as amended (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), among the Company, the
Whitmire Stockholders, and Robert D. Walter, Chairman of the Company.  Under
the Registration Rights Agreement, the Whitmire Stockholders are entitled to
require the Company to file a registration statement under the Securities Act
with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the sale of their shares
(a "Required Registration") up to seven times in the five-year period ending
April 25, 1999, unless earlier terminated or extended as provided below.  The
Whitmire Stockholders may only request up to four Required Registrations during
the three-year period ending April 25, 1997.  The Company will pay all expenses
incurred in connection with up to four Required Registrations, exclusive of the
fees and expenses of counsel for selling stockholders.  In addition, the
selling Whitmire Stockholders will be responsible for any underwriters'
discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of their shares.


         The Company is not required to effect the first Required Registration
under the Registration Rights Agreement unless Whitmire Stockholders (together
with certain permitted transferees) making the request hold at least 1,250,000
Common Shares, and the Company is not required to effect subsequent Required
Registrations unless such persons hold (i) at least 937,500 Common Shares
acquired in the Whitmire Merger, or (ii) Common Shares acquired in the Whitmire
Merger with a fair market value of at least $25 million.  The Whitmire
Stockholders may not make a request for a Required Registration until 180 days
have elapsed since the completion of a prior Required Registration.  In
addition, the Company has the right to delay for up to 90 days the filing of a
registration statement with respect to a Required Registration if the Company's
Board of Directors determines such action is in the best interests of the
Company's shareholders, but the Company may not invoke a delay if at least 12
months have not elapsed from the end of any previous delay period.  These
delays and certain other events will extend on a day-for-day basis the five-and
three-year periods referred to in the preceding and following paragraphs.


         The Registration Rights Agreement also provides that the Whitmire
Stockholders have the right to include their Class A Common Shares in
registration statements filed by the Company in connection with primary or
secondary offerings for cash (with certain exceptions).  These "piggyback"
registration rights also terminate on April 25, 1999, unless earlier terminated
or extended.

         The demand and piggyback registration rights granted to (i) CEA, its
affiliates and successors (the "Chemical Holders"), and (ii) Apollo, its
affiliates and successors (the "Apollo Holders"), terminate prior to April 25,
1999, if the Chemical Holders or the Apollo Holders, as the case may be, either
(i) shall beneficially own fewer than 312,500 Common Shares or (ii) shall
acquire more than an additional 625,000 Common Shares without the Company's
consent.  The Registration Rights Agreement also limits the grant by the
Company of additional registration rights.

Registration Statement by the Initial Holder(s) which made such Request (a
"Withdrawn Request") and a Required Registration Statement may be withdrawn
prior to the effectiveness thereof by the Holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities included therein (a "Withdrawn Required Registration"),
and, in either such event, such withdrawal shall be treated as a Required
Registration which shall have been effected pursuant to clause (z) of the
immediately preceding paragraph, except that the Holders may





                                      -8-

<PAGE>   11


require the Company to disregard one Withdrawn Request for purposes of such
clause (z) and to pay all Registration Expenses in connection therewith
(exclusive of those referred to in clause (viii) of the definition thereof)
and, if the Holders pay such Registration Expenses incurred in connection with
one Withdrawn Required Registration, the Holders may require the Company to
treat the Required Registration attributable to such Withdrawn Required
Registration as not occurring during the period specified in sub-clause (ii) of
said clause (z) and as a Required Registration for which the Company has not
paid the Registration Expenses for purposes of the four paid Required
Registration limitation set forth in Section 2(c).

                 The Initial Holders shall not, without the Company's consent,
be entitled to deliver a Request for a Required Registration after the
completion of the initial Required Registration if (i) less than 180 calendar
days have elapsed since (A) the effective date of a prior Required Registration
Statement or (B) in the case of a Required Registration which is effected other
than by means of an Underwritten Offering, since the sale by the Holders of
their Registrable Securities pursuant thereto or (C) the date of withdrawal of
a Withdrawn Required Registration or (ii) the amount of Registrable Securities
requested to be included therein by all Holders is less than the lesser of (A)
750,000 Common Shares or (B) Common Shares having a fair market value of $25
million (based on the closing price of the Class A Common Shares in the
principal trading market therefor as of the close of trading on the trading day
immediately preceding the date of the Request with respect to the relevant
Required Registration).

                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may delay the
filing of a registration statement required pursuant to this Section 2(a) only
if the Board of Directors of the Company determines that such action is in the
best interests of the Company's stockholders and only for a period not to
exceed 90 days (a "Blackout Period"); provided that after any initial Blackout
Period the Company may not invoke a subsequent Blackout Period until 12 months
elapse from the end of any previous Blackout Period and the number of days in
each Blackout Period shall be deemed to effect a day-for-day extension of the
five-year period referred to in the first sentence of this Section 2(a) and the
first sentence of Section 2(b), the three-year period referred to in clause
(z)(ii) of the first sentence of the third immediately preceding paragraph and
the three- and two-year periods referred to in the proviso to the second
sentence of Section 6(a).

                 The registration rights granted pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 2(a) shall be in addition to the registration rights granted
pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 2.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Chemical Holders or the MD Holders shall cease to have the
Required Registration rights set forth in this Section 2(a) if the Initial
Holders for such class of holders (i.e., Chemical Equity Associates and its
Affiliates and successors for the Chemical Holders, and MD Investors, L.P. and
Apollo Advisors, L.P. and their respective Affiliates and successors for the MD
Holders) (i) beneficially owns less than 250,000 Common Shares (exclusive of
any After-Acquired Shares) or (ii) acquires more than 500,000 additional Common
Shares without the Company's consent (except Common Shares acquired from other
Persons included in that Initial Holder, Common Shares acquired upon
dissolution of MD Investors, L.P. and, in the case of Chemical Holders, Class A
Common Shares obtained upon conversion of Class B Common Shares received
pursuant to the Merger or Class B Common Shares obtained upon conversion of
Class A Common Shares received pursuant to the Merger), it being agreed that
one such Initial Holder's beneficial ownership of less than 250,000 Common
Shares or acquisition of more than an additional 500,000 Common Shares shall
not affect the registration rights hereunder of the other such Initial Holder
or of any Management Holder.

                 (ii)  Priority in Required Registrations.  If a Required
Registration pursuant to this Section 2(a) involves an Underwritten Offering,
and the sole Underwriter or the lead managing Underwriter, as the case may be,
of such Underwritten Offering shall advise the Company in writing (with a copy
to each Holder requesting registration) on or before the date 5 days prior to
the date then scheduled for such offering that, in its opinion, the amount of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Required Registration
exceeds the amount which can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the distribution of the Registrable Securities being offered, the
Company will include in such Required Registration only the amount of
Registrable Securities that the Company is so advised can be sold in such
offering; provided, however, that the Company shall be required to include in
such Required Registration first, all Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the Required Registration by the Holders and, to the extent not all
such Registrable Securities can be included in such Required Registration, the
number of Registrable Securities to be included shall be allocated pro rata on
the basis of the number of Common Shares beneficially owned at that time by all
the Holders requesting to participate in the Required Registration or on such
other basis as shall be agreed among the





                                      -10-

<PAGE>   13


Holders, by agreement of the Majority Holders within each class of Holders
which are affected thereby (i.e., Chemical Holders, Management Holders and/or
MD Holders); and second, if all Registrable Securities requested to be included
in the Required Registration by the Holders can be so included, all other
securities requesting, in accordance with any registration rights which are
granted in compliance with Section 6(a), to be included in such Required
Registration which are of the same class as the Registrable Securities and, to
the extent not all such securities can be included in such Required
Registration, the number of securities to be included shall be allocated pro
rata among the holders thereof requesting inclusion in such Required
Registration on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included
by all such holders; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2(a)(ii) are subject to such rights as the former shareholders of
Solomons Company have pursuant to the registration rights provisions applicable
to such former shareholders, a true and complete copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit A.  In the event the Company will not, by virtue of this
paragraph, include in any Required Registration all of the Registrable
Securities of any MD Holder, Chemical Holder or Management Holder requested to
be included in such Required Registration, such MD Holder, Chemical Holder or
Management Holder may, upon written notice to the Company given within 5 days
of the time such MD Holder, Chemical Holder or Management Holder first is
notified of such matter, reduce the amount of Registrable Securities it desires
to have included in such Required Registration, whereupon only the Registrable
Securities, if any, it desires to have included will be so included and the
Holders not so reducing shall be entitled to a corresponding increase in the
amount of Registrable Securities to be included in such Required Registration.

                 (b)  Incidental Registration.

                 (i)  Right to Include Registrable Securities.  If at any time
prior to the fifth anniversary of the expiration of the Pooling Holding Period
(subject to extension in accordance with the penultimate paragraph of Section
2(a)(i) and Section 3(a)) the Company proposes to register any of its Class A
Common Shares under the Securities Act (other than (A) any registration of
public sales or distributions solely by and for the account of the Company of
securities issued (x) pursuant to any employee benefit or similar plan or any
dividend reinvestment plan or (y) in any acquisition by the Company, or (B)
pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof), either in connection with a primary offering
for cash for the account of the Company or a secondary offering, the Company
will,





                                      -11-

<PAGE>   14


each time it intends to effect such a registration, give written notice to all
Initial Holders of Registrable Securities at least 10 business days prior to
the initial filing of a Registration Statement with the SEC pertaining thereto,
informing such Initial Holders of its intent to file such Registration
Statement and of the Holders' rights to request the registration of the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders under this Section 2(b) (the
"Company Notice").  Upon the written request of any Initial Holder made within
7 business days after any such Company Notice is given (which request shall
specify the Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Initial
Holder and such Initial Holder's Permitted Transferees and, unless the
applicable registration is intended to effect a primary offering of Common
Shares for cash for the account of the Company, the intended method of
distribution thereof), the Company will use all reasonable efforts to effect
the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which
the Company has been so requested to register by such Initial Holders to the
extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended
methods of distribution thereof or, in the case of a registration which is
intended to effect a primary offering for cash for the account of the Company,
in accordance with the Company's intended method of distribution) of the
Registrable Securities so requested to be registered, including, if necessary,
by filing with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a supplement to the
Incidental Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document
incorporated therein by reference or by filing any other required document or
otherwise supplementing or amending the Incidental Registration Statement, if
required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the
registration form used by the Company for such Incidental Registration
Statement or by the Securities Act, any state securities or blue sky laws, or
any rules and regulations thereunder; provided, however, that if, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and
prior to the effective date of the Incidental Registration Statement filed in
connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason
not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company may,
at its election, give written notice of such determination to each Initial
Holder of Registrable Securities and, thereupon, (A) in the case of a
determination not to register, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation
to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such registration
(but not from its obligation to pay the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection therewith), and (B) in the case of a determination to delay such
registration, the Company shall be permitted to delay registration of any
Registrable Securities requested to be included in





                                      -12-

<PAGE>   15


such Incidental Registration Statement for the same period as the delay in
registering such other securities.

                 The registration rights granted pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 2(b) shall be in addition to the registration rights granted
pursuant to the other provisions of this Section.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Chemical Holders or the MD Holders shall cease to have the
Incidental Registration rights set forth in this Section 2(b) if the Initial
Holders for such class of holders (i.e., Chemical Equity Associates and its
Affiliates and successors for the Chemical Holders, and MD Investors, L.P. and
Apollo Advisors, L.P. and their respective Affiliates and successors for the MD
Holders) (i) beneficially owns less than 250,000 Common Shares (exclusive of
any After-Acquired Shares) or (ii) acquires more than 500,000 additional Common
Shares without the Company's consent (except Common Shares acquired from other
Persons included in that Initial Holder, Common Shares acquired upon
dissolution of MD Investors, L.P. and, in the case of Chemical Holders, Class A
Common Shares obtained upon conversion of Class B Common Shares received
pursuant to the Merger or Class B Common Shares obtained upon conversion of
Class A Common Shares received pursuant to the Merger), it being agreed that
one such Initial Holder's beneficial ownership of less than 250,000 Common
Shares or acquisition of more than an additional 500,000 Common Shares shall
not affect the registration rights hereunder of the other such Initial Holder
or of any Management Holder.

                 (ii)  Priority in Incidental Registrations.  If a registration
pursuant to this Section 2(b) involves an Underwritten Offering of the
securities so being registered, whether or not for sale for the account of the
Company, and the sole Underwriter or the lead managing Underwriter, as the case
may be, of such Underwritten Offering shall advise the Company in writing (with
a copy to each Initial Holder of Registrable Securities requesting
registration) on or before the date 5 days prior to the date then scheduled for
such offering that, in its opinion, the amount of securities (including
Registrable Securities) requested to be included in such registration exceeds
the amount which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without
adversely affecting the distribution of the securities being offered, then the
Company will include in such registration first, all the securities entitled to
be sold pursuant to such Registration Statement without reference to the
incidental registration rights of any holder (including Holders), and second,
the amount of other securities (including Registrable Securities) requested to
be included in such registration that the Company is so advised can be sold in
(or during the time of)





                                      -13-

<PAGE>   16


such offering, allocated, if necessary, pro rata among the holders (including
the Holders) thereof requesting such registration on the basis of the number of
the securities (including Registrable Securities) beneficially owned at the
time by the holders (including Holders) requesting inclusion of their
securities; provided, however, that in the event the Company will not, by
virtue of this paragraph, include in any such registration all of the
Registrable Securities of any Holder requested to be included in such
registration, such Holder may, upon written notice to the Company given within
3 days of the time such Holder first is notified of such matter, reduce the
amount of Registrable Securities it desires to have included in such
registration, whereupon only the Registrable Securities, if any, it desires to
have included will be so included and the Holders not so reducing shall be
entitled to a corresponding increase in the amount of Registrable Securities to
be included in such registration.

                 (c)  Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with (i) each of four registrations requested pursuant
to Section 2(a) (subject to Section 2(a)(i)) and (ii) each registration as to
which Holders request inclusion of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section
2(b), and the Holders of Registrable Securities requesting a Required
Registration pursuant to Section 2(a) to which clause (i) of this sentence
shall not apply shall pay the Registration Expenses (exclusive of those
referred to in clause (viii) of the definition thereof) attributable to any
such Required Registration which is requested, it being agreed that the
Majority Holders shall determine in each instance whether a Required
Registration which is requested shall be one of the four as to which the
Company pays the Registration Expenses.  Each Holder shall pay all discounts
and commissions payable to underwriters, selling brokers, managers or other
similar Persons related to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable
Securities pursuant to any registration pursuant to this Section.

                 (d)  Effective Registration Statement; Suspension.  Subject to
the third paragraph of Section 2(a)(i), a Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 2(a) will not be deemed to have become effective (and the related
registration will not be deemed to have been effected) unless it has been
declared effective by the SEC prior to a request by the Holders of a majority
of the Registrable Securities included in such registration that such
Registration Statement be withdrawn; provided, however, that if, after it has
been declared effective, the offering of any Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or
other order or requirement of the SEC or





                                      -14-

<PAGE>   17


any other governmental agency or court, such Registration Statement will be
deemed not to have become effective and the related registration will not be
deemed to have been effected.

                 Any period during which the Company fails to keep any Required
Registration Statement effective and usable for resale of Registrable
Securities shall be referred to as a "Suspension Period."  A Suspension Period
shall commence on and include the date that the Company gives notice that any
Required Registration Statement is no longer effective or usable for resale of
Registrable Securities to and including the date when each Holder of
Registrable Securities covered by such Required Registration Statement either
receives the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by
Section 4(j) or is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
Prospectus may be resumed.  In the event of one or more Suspension Periods, the
applicable time period referenced in the first paragraph of Section 2(a)(i))
shall be extended by the number of days included in each such Suspension
Period, and, in the event any Suspension Period occurs sooner than 30 days
after the end of the previous Suspension Period or 30 days after the initial
effectiveness of any Required Registration Statement, none of the days between
such Suspension Periods or prior to such Suspension Period shall be included in
computing such applicable time period.

                 (e)  Selection of Underwriters.  At any time or from time to
time, the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities covered by a
Required Registration Statement may elect to have such Registrable Securities
sold in an Underwritten Offering and may select the investment banker or
investment bankers and manager or managers that will serve as lead managing
Underwriter or sole Underwriter with respect to the offering of such
Registrable Securities; provided that the Company shall be entitled to select
one co-managing Underwriter therefor.  No Holder may participate in any
Underwritten Offering hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such
Holder's securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements
approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b)
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody
agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required
under the terms of such Underwritten Offering.

                 Section 3.  Holdback Arrangements.

                 (a)  Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities.  (i) Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees, if the
applicable offering is a primary Underwritten Offering of Common Shares for
cash for the account of the Company as to which such Holder is eligible to
participate pursuant to Section 2(b), the requirements of the immediately
following sentence are satisfied, and the sole Underwriter or lead managing
Underwriter in such Offering so requests, not to effect any public sale or
distribution of Registrable Securities (including any sales pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act) during the period commencing on the date the
Initial Holders receive the Company Notice pursuant to Section 2(b) and
continuing until 60 days after the effective date of the Registration Statement
or any shorter period which the sole or lead managing Underwriter shall request
(except for sales of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement).  The Holders shall not be obligated to agree to the
restrictions set forth in this Section 3(a)(i) (A) unless the registration
statement for the offering by the Company is filed with the SEC within 20
calendar days after giving the Company Notice and relates to a primary offering
for cash of Common Shares for net proceeds of $50,000,000 for the account of
the Company (based upon the closing price of the Class A Common Shares in the
principal trading market therefor as of the close of trading on the trading
date immediately preceding the date of the Company Notice with respect to such
offering), the Company uses all reasonable efforts to have such registration
statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after filing and
such registration statement is declared effective no later than the 60th
calendar day after giving the Company Notice, (B) unless at least 180 calendar
days have elapsed since the expiration or termination of the Holders' agreement
pursuant to this Section 3(a)(i) with respect to any prior Company registration
to which the restrictions of this Section 3(a)(i) apply (except in the case of
the initial such Company registration) and (C) until the Holders have sold
Registrable Securities pursuant to at least one Required Registration or, if
sooner, until the second anniversary of the termination of the Pooling Holding
Period.  Those Holders included in any class of Holders (i.e., MD Holders,
Management Holders or Chemical Holders) which class has beneficially owned in
the aggregate less than 1,000,000 Common Shares for at least six months shall
not be obligated to agree to the restrictions set forth in this Section
3(a)(i).  The period of time during which any agreement provided by this
Section 3(a)(i) is in effect shall be deemed to effect a day-for-day extension
of the five-year





                                      -16-

<PAGE>   19


period referred to in the first sentence of Section 2(a) and the first sentence
of Section 2(b), the three-year period referred to in clause (z) of the first
sentence of the second paragraph of Section 2(a)(i) and the three- and two-year
periods referred to in the proviso to the second sentence of Section 6(a).

                 (ii)  Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees with each
other Holder, if the applicable offering is a Required Registration for an
Underwritten Offering and the sole Underwriter or lead managing Underwriter so
requests, not to effect any public sale or distribution of Registrable
Securities (including any sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act)
during the period commencing on the date the Company receives a Request from a
Holder and continuing until 90 days after the commencement of the Underwritten
Offering or any shorter period which the sole or lead managing Underwriter
shall request, except for sale of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant
to the applicable Required Registration Statement.

                 (b)  Restrictions on Public Sale by the Company and Walter.
The Company and Walter each agrees not to effect any public sale or
distribution (other than, in the case of the Company, public sales or
distributions solely by and for the account of the Company of securities issued
pursuant to any employee benefit or similar plan or any dividend reinvestment
plan) of any securities (including, in the case of Walter, any sales pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) during the period commencing on the date
the Company receives a Request from an Initial Holder and continuing until 90
days (or, in the case of Walter, 60 days or such longer period, but not in
excess of 90 days, if the trading days in excess of 60 days coincide with a
Restricted Period) after the commencement of an Underwritten Offering, if
requested by the sole Underwriter or lead managing Underwriter in such
Underwritten Offering, or for such shorter period as the sole or lead managing
Underwriter shall request; provided, however, that Walter shall not be
obligated to enter into the agreement pursuant to this Section 3(b) with
respect to any Required Registration following the sale of Holders' Registrable
Securities pursuant to the first Required Registration unless at least 30
calendar days coinciding with the Unrestricted Period shall have elapsed since
the expiration or termination of the restrictions contemplated by any agreement
which Walter shall enter into pursuant to this Section 3(b) with respect to the
immediately preceding Required Registration which shall have been effected and
provided, further, that Walter shall not be obligated to enter the agreement





                                      -17-

<PAGE>   20


contemplated by this Section 3(b) after (i) the sale of Holders' Registrable
Securities pursuant to three Required Registrations (or if six months have
elapsed since Walter shall have ceased to be an officer and director of the
Company) or (ii) if earlier, December 31, 1996 (which date shall be extended on
a day-for-day basis by the number of days in each Blackout Period and the
number of days during which Holders are subject to the agreement provided by
Section 3(a)(i), but in either event not beyond June 30, 1997).

                 Section 4.  Registration Procedures.

                 In connection with the obligations of the Company pursuant to
Section 2, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to effect or cause to
be effected the registration of the Registrable Securities under the Securities
Act to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities by the Holders in
accordance with their intended method or methods of distribution, and the
Company shall:

                 (a)  (i)  prepare and file a Registration Statement with the
SEC which (x) shall be on Form S-3 (or any successor to such form), if
available, or a form selected by the requesting Holders for which the Company
qualifies and which the Company approves (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld), (y) shall be available for the sale or exchange of the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by
the selling Holders thereof, and (z) shall comply as to form with the
requirements of the applicable form and include all financial statements
required by the SEC to be filed therewith and all other information reasonably
requested by the lead managing Underwriter or sole Underwriter, if applicable,
to be included therein, (ii) use all reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective in accordance
with Section 2, (iii) use all reasonable efforts to not take any action that
would cause a Registration Statement to contain a material misstatement or
omission or to be not effective and usable for resale of Registrable Securities
during the period that such Registration Statement is required to be effective
and usable, and (iv) cause each Registration Statement and the related
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of
such Registration Statement, amendment or supplement (x) to comply in all
material respects with any requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC and (y) not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;





                                      -18-

<PAGE>   21



                 (b)  subject to paragraph (j) of this Section 4, prepare and
file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each such
Registration Statement, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective for the applicable period; cause each such Prospectus to be
supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to
be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; and comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by each Registration Statement during the applicable period
in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the
selling Holders thereof, as set forth in such registration statement;

                 (c)  furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities and to
each Underwriter of an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, if any,
without charge, as many copies of each Prospectus, including each preliminary
Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto and such other documents as
such Holder or Underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities; the Company
hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus, including each preliminary
Prospectus, by each Holder of Registrable Securities and each Underwriter of an
Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, if any, in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by the Prospectus or
the preliminary Prospectus (the Holders hereby agreeing not to make a broad
public dissemination of a form of preliminary Prospectus which is designed to
be a "quiet filing" without the Company's consent, such consent to not be
withheld unreasonably);

                 (d)  (i)  use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify
the Registrable Securities, no later than the time the applicable Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC, under all applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as each Underwriter, if
any, or any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement, shall reasonably request; (ii) use all reasonable efforts to keep
each such registration or qualification effective during the period such
Registration Statement is required to be kept effective; and (iii) do any and
all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable each such Underwriter, if any, and Holder to consummate the disposition
in each such jurisdiction of such Registrable Securities owned by such Holder;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to qualify as a
foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which
it is not so qualified or to





                                      -19-

<PAGE>   22


consent to be subject to general service of process (other than service of
process in connection with such registration or qualification or any sale of
Registrable Securities in connection therewith) in any such jurisdiction;

                 (e)  notify each Holder of Registrable Securities promptly,
and, if requested by such Holder, confirm such advice in writing, (i) when a
Registration Statement has become effective and when any post-effective
amendments and supplements thereto become effective, (ii) of the issuance by
the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order, injunction or
other order or requirement suspending the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if,
between the effective date of a Registration Statement and the closing of any
sale of securities covered thereby pursuant to any agreement to which the
Company is a party, the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in such agreement cease to be true and correct in all material respects or if
the Company receives any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the
initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, (iv) of the happening of any
event during the period a Registration Statement is effective as a result of
which such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

                 (k)  enter into customary agreements (including, in the case

         Holders of the Registrable Securities being sold) addressed to each
         selling Holder and the Underwriters, if any, covering the matters

         shall cover matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort"
         letters to underwriters in connection with primary underwritten
         offerings;

                 (4)  to the extent requested and customary for the relevant
         transaction, enter into a securities sales agreement with the Holders
         and such representative of the selling Holders as the Majority Holders
         of the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement
         relating to the Registration and providing for, among other things,
         the appointment of such representative as agent for the selling

         Securities being sold or by the managing Underwriters, if any.

The above shall be done (i) at the effectiveness of such Registration Statement
(and each post-effective amendment thereto) in connection with any
registration, and (ii) at each closing under any underwriting or similar
agreement as and to the extent required thereunder;

                 (l)  make available for inspection by representatives of the
Initial Holders of the Registrable Securities and any Underwriters
participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration Statement and any
counsel or accountant retained by such Holders or Underwriters, all relevant
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of
the Company and cause the respective officers,





                                      -22-

directors and employees of the Company to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such representative, Underwriter, counsel or accountant in
connection with a Registration Statement;

                 (m)  (i)  within a reasonable time prior to the filing of any
Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any amendment to a Registration
Statement or amendment or supplement to a Prospectus, provide copies of such
document to the Initial Holders of Registrable Securities and to counsel to
such Initial Holders and to the Underwriter or Underwriters of an Underwritten
Offering of Registrable Securities, if any; fairly consider such reasonable
changes in any such document prior to or after the filing thereof as the
counsel to the Holders or the Underwriter or the Underwriters may request and
not file any such document in a form to which the Majority Holders of any class
of Registrable Securities being registered or any Underwriter shall reasonably
object; and make such of the representatives of the Company as shall be
reasonably requested by the Holders of Registrable Securities being registered
or any Underwriter available for discussion of such document;

                          (ii)  within a reasonable time prior to the filing of
any document which is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration
Statement or a Prospectus, provide copies of such document to counsel for the
Holders; fairly consider such reasonable changes in such document prior to or
after the filing thereof as counsel for such Holders or such Underwriter shall
request; and make such of the representatives of the Company as shall be

of an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, if any;

                 (o)  otherwise use all reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including making available to its

thereunder;





                                      -23-

<PAGE>   26



                 (p)  cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made
with the NASD and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any
Underwriter in an Underwritten Offering; and

                 (q)  use all reasonable efforts to facilitate the distribution
and sale of any Registrable Securities to be offered pursuant to this
Agreement, including without limitation by making road show presentations,
holding meetings with potential investors and taking such other actions as
shall be requested by the Majority Holders of Registrable Securities covered by
a Registration Statement or the lead managing Underwriter of an Underwritten
Offering.

                 Each selling Holder of Registrable Securities as to which any
registration is being effected pursuant to this Agreement agrees, as a
condition to the registration obligations with respect to such Holder provided
herein, to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder
required to be included in the Registration Statement, the ownership of
Registrable Securities by such Holder and the proposed distribution by such
Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing.

                 Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in paragraph
(e)(iv) of this Section, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the affected Registration Statement until
such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus,
contemplated by paragraph (j) of this Section, and, if so directed by the
Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at the expense of the
Company), all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then
in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities which was current at the time of receipt of such notice.

                 Section 5.  Indemnification; Contribution.

                 (a)  Indemnification by the Company.  The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Person who participates as an underwriter (any
such Person being an "Underwriter"), each Holder and their respective partners,
directors, officers and employees and each Person, if any, who controls any
Holder or Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act as follows:





                                      -24-

<PAGE>   27



                   (i)     against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
         damages, judgments and reasonable expenses whatsoever, as incurred,
         arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
         material fact contained in any Registration Statement pursuant to
         which Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act,
         including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the
         omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to
         be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
         misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
         statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, including
         all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or
         alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to
         make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
         which they were made, not misleading;

                  (ii)     against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
         damages, judgments and reasonable expenses whatsoever, as incurred, to
         the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any
         litigation, investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or
         body, commenced or threatened, or of any other claim whatsoever based
         upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
         statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written
         consent of the Company; and

                 (iii)     against any and all reasonable expense whatsoever,
         as incurred (including fees and disbursements of counsel), incurred in
         investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation,
         investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body,
         commenced or threatened, in each case whether or not such Person is a
         party, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or
         omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the
         extent that any such expense is not paid under sub-paragraph (i) or
         (ii) above;

provided, however, that this indemnity agreement does not apply to any Holder
or Underwriter with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, judgment or
expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, or the omission or
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, in any such case made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by such Holder





                                      -25-

<PAGE>   28


or Underwriter expressly for use in a Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

                 (b)  Indemnification by Holders.  (i)  Each selling Holder
severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Underwriter
and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective partners,
directors, officers and employees (including each officer of the Company who
signed the Registration Statement), and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company, any Underwriter or any other selling Holder within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, damages, judgments and expenses described in the indemnity contained in
paragraph (a) of this Section (provided that any settlement of the type
described therein is effected with the written consent of such selling Holder),
as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue
statements of a material fact contained in any Prospectus or the omissions, or
alleged omissions therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, in any such case made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by such selling Holder expressly
for use in such Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

                 (c)  Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.  Each indemnified
party or parties shall give reasonably prompt notice to each indemnifying party
or parties of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure so to notify an indemnifying
party or parties shall not relieve it or them from any liability which it or
they may have under this indemnity agreement, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice.  If
the indemnifying party or parties so elects within a reasonable time after
receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party or parties may assume the
defense of such action or proceeding at such indemnifying party's or parties'
expense with counsel chosen by the indemnifying party or parties and approved
by the indemnified party defendant in such action or proceeding, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that, if such
indemnified party or parties determine in good faith that a conflict of
interest exists and that therefore it is advisable for such indemnified party
or parties to be represented by separate counsel or that, upon advice of
counsel, there may be legal defenses





                                      -26-

<PAGE>   29


available to it or them which are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party, then the indemnifying party or parties
shall not be entitled to assume such defense and the indemnified party or
parties shall be entitled to separate counsel (limited in each jurisdiction to
one counsel for all Underwriters and another counsel for all other indemnified
parties under this Agreement) at the indemnifying party's or parties' expense.
If an indemnifying party or parties is not so entitled to assume the defense of
such action or does not assume such defense, after having received the notice
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party or
parties will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
indemnified party or parties (limited in each jurisdiction to one counsel for
all Underwriters and another counsel for all other indemnified parties under
this Agreement).  No indemnifying party or parties will be liable for any
settlement effected without the written consent of such indemnifying party or
parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  If an indemnifying
party is entitled to assume, and assumes, the defense of such action or
proceeding in accordance with this paragraph, such indemnifying party or
parties shall not, except as otherwise provided in this subsection (c), be
liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties
incurred thereafter in connection with such action or proceeding.

                 (d)  Contribution.  (i)  In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement
provided for in this Section is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the
indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms in respect
of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses suffered by
an indemnified party referred to therein, each applicable indemnifying party,
in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of
the liable selling Holders (including, in each case, that of their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents) on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims,
damages, judgments or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the
liable selling Holders (including, in each case, that of their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents) on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue





                                      -27-

<PAGE>   30


statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand,
or by or on behalf of the selling Holders, on the other, and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in paragraph (c) of this Section, any legal or other fees or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending
any action or claim.

                 (ii)  The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
paragraph (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to in sub-paragraph (i) above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this
paragraph (d), in the case of distributions to the public, an indemnifying
Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which (A) the total price at which the Registrable Securities sold by such
indemnifying Holder and its affiliated indemnifying Holders and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds (B) the amount of any damages
which such indemnifying Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

                 (iii)  For purposes of this Section, each Person, if any, who
controls a Holder or an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act (and their respective partners, directors, officers and
employees) shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder or
Underwriter; and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who
signed the Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, shall have the
same rights to contribution as the Company.

                 Section 6.  Miscellaneous.

                 (a)  No Inconsistent Agreements.  The Company will not on or
after the date of this Agreement enter into any





                                      -28-

<PAGE>   31


agreement which conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement or which grants
registration or similar rights nor has the Company entered into any such
agreement, except for the registration rights in the form set forth in Exhibit
A hereto which have been granted heretofore to shareholders of Solomons
Company, and the Company will not on or after the date of this Agreement modify
in any manner adverse to the Holders the existing agreement with shareholders
of Solomons Company; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall
prohibit the Company from granting registration rights, which are exercisable
on or after the third anniversary of the termination of the Pooling Holding
Period (or at any time on or after the second anniversary of the termination of
the Pooling Holding Period if each class of Holders (i.e., the MD Holders, the
Chemical Holders and the Management Holders), beneficially owns less than
750,000 Common Shares), to any Person (a "Third Party") who becomes an owner of
shares of Company Stock after the date hereof (including granting incidental
registration rights with respect to any Registration Statement required to be
filed or maintained hereunder) if, and only if, (i) any registration pursuant
to the Third Party's registration rights permits the Holders of Registrable
Securities to participate in any such registration on the terms set forth in
Section 2(b), (ii) the Third Party's incidental registration rights with
respect to any registration required to be effected pursuant hereto relate only
to the Third Party's securities of the same class as those actually registered
in any such registration hereunder, utilize the method of disposition utilized
by the selling Holders and contain priority in registration provisions no more
favorable to the Third Party who may seek to participate through its incidental
registration rights in any registration initiated pursuant to Section 2(a)
hereof or in any registration as to which the Holders may participate pursuant
to Section 2(b) hereof than those incidental registration rights contained in
Section 2(b)(ii) hereof with respect to Holders of Registrable Securities
participating in any registration not initiated pursuant to this Agreement and
(iii) require the Third Party to enter into the agreements provided for in
Section 3(b) hereof on the terms and for the period applicable to the Company
(including preventing sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) if
requested by the sole Underwriter or lead managing Underwriter in an
Underwritten Offering initiated by Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant
to Section 2(a), so long as the Holders of Registrable Securities agree to
enter into the agreements provided for in Section 3(a)(i) hereof if the Third
Party shall initiate a required registration of Common Shares for cash in an
Underwritten Offering as to which the Holders are entitled to participate
pursuant to Section 2(b) and if in connection therewith the





                                      -29-

<PAGE>   32


sole Underwriter or the lead managing Underwriter shall request the Holders to
enter into such agreements.  The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not
in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to
the holders of the Company's other issued and outstanding securities under any
such agreements.

                 (b)  Amendments and Waivers.  The provisions of this
Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended,
modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the
provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written
consent of a majority of the Holders and, if any such amendment, modification,
supplement, waiver or consent would adversely affect the rights of any Holder
hereunder, the written consent of each class of Holders which is affected
(i.e., MD Holders, Management Holders and/or Chemical Holders, as applicable)
shall be obtained; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit any
amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent the effect of which is
limited only to those Holders who have agreed to such amendment, modification,
supplement, waiver or consent.

                 (c)  Notices.  All notices and other communications provided
for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery, telex,
telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (i) if to a Holder,
at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company by means of a
notice given in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c), which
address initially is, with respect to each Holder as of the date hereof, the
address set forth next to such Holder's name on the signature pages hereof, and
with respect to each Holder who becomes such after the date hereof, the address
of such Holder in the stock or warrant records of the Company, or (ii) if to
the Company at 655 Metro Place South, Suite 925, Dublin, Ohio  43017,
telecopier number 614-761-8919, Attention:  General Counsel, and thereafter at
such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions
of this paragraph (c), with a copy to Baker & Hostetler, 3200 National City
Center, Cleveland, Ohio  44114-3485, telecopier number 216-696-0740, Attention:
John M. Gherlein, Esq.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
obligated to provide any notice to any Holder which is not an Initial Holder
except with respect to a Required or Incidental Registration Statement which
has been filed and pursuant to which such Holder is identified as a selling
stockholder.

                 All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have
been duly given:  at the time delivered by hand, if





                                      -30-

personally delivered; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is
acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next business day if timely delivered
to a courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 6(d) is intended to enlarge the class of Persons which
are Holders, as defined in the preamble of this Agreement, and thus entitled to
the rights granted hereunder.

                 (d)  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of
each of the parties, including, without the need for an express assignment,
subsequent Holders.  If any successor, assignee or transferee of any Holder
shall acquire Registrable Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law
or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the
terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities
such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to
perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to receive the
benefits hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6(d)
is intended to enlarge the class of Persons which are Holders, as defined in
the preamble of this Agreement, and thus entitled to the rights granted
hereunder.  For purposes of this Agreement, "successor" for any entity other
than a natural person shall mean a successor to such entity as a result of such
entity's merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, sale of substantially
all of its assets, or similar transaction.

                 (e)  Recapitalizations, Exchanges, etc., Affecting Registrable
Securities.  The provisions of this Agreement shall apply, to the full extent
set forth herein with respect to the Registrable Securities, to any and all
securities or capital stock of the Company or any successor or assign of the
Company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) which
may be issued in respect of, in exchange for, or in substitution of such
Registrable Securities, by reason of any dividend, split, issuance, reverse
split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation
or otherwise.  Upon the occurrence of any of such events, Common Share amounts
hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted if necessary.

                 (f)  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which counterparts, taken together, shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

                 (g)  Descriptive Headings, Etc.  The headings in this

                               FIRST AMENDMENT TO
                         REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT



        THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this
"Amendment"), dated as of June   , 1984, by and among the signatories
hereto, amends the REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the "Original
Agreement"), dated as of October 11, 1993, by and among CARDINAL
HEALTH, INC., an Ohio corporation formerly known as Cardinal
Distribution, Inc. (the "Company"), MD INVESTORS, L.P. ("MD
Investors"), a Delaware limited partnership which has dissolved,
CHEMICAL EQUITY ASSOCIATES, a California limited partnership ("CEA"),
MELBURN G. WHITMIRE, and, for purposes of Section 3(b) of the Original
Agreement only, ROBERT D. WALTER.


        WHEREAS, the parties entered into the Original Agreement which
provides certain registration rights to "Holders" (as such term is
defined in the Original Agreement) on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided therein; and


        WHEREAS, MD Investors, a party to the Original Agreement, has
dissolved and its successors are Apollo Investment Fund, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, and CEA.


        WHEREAS, Cardinal has declared a five-for-four stock split
payable June 30, 1984, to holders of record on June 15, 1994, and all
references to Common Shares in this First Amendment reflect
appropriate adjustments for the split;


        WHEREAS, the parties desire by this Amendment to amend the
Original Agreement in certain respects;


        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:


        1.   DEFINITION OF RESTRICTED PERIOD.  The definition of
"Restricted period" in Section 1 of the Original Agreement shall be
deleted in its entirety and there be substituted therefor the
following:


        "RESTRICTED PERIOD" shall include each of the months of
  March, June, July, September and December in any calendar year
  and the portions of the months of January, April, August and
  October, commencing at the beginning thereof and ending at the
  end of the second business day following the Company's
  announcement of earnings for the most recently completed fiscal
  quarter.


<PAGE>   38
        2.    NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENT.  Section 6(a) of the Original
Agreement shall be amended by the addition at the end of such Section
of the following:


        "The provisions of this Section 6(a) to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the Company may, in connection with its
  acquisition (the "Behrens Acquisition") of all of the capital
  stock of Behrens Inc., a Texas corporation ("Behrens"), from the
  holders thereof (the "Behrens Stockholders"), grant the following
  registration rights to the Behrens Stockholders.


         (i) The Company may grant to the Behrens Stockholders
  registration rights (the "Behrens Registration Rights") on an
  aggregate of 187,500 of the Common Shares delivered to them in
  connection with the Behrens Acquisition, with such Behrens
  Registration Rights allocated proportionally among all Behrens
  Stockholders;


        (ii) The Behrens Registration Rights will provide that, if
  during the period (the "Covered Period") beginning 48 hours
  following the publication by the Company of financial results
  reflecting at least 30 days of combined operations of the Company
  and Behrens and ending two years after the consummation of the
  Behrens Acquisition (unless earlier terminated as described
  below), the Company files a registration statement under the
  Securities Act on Form S-3 (or other form for the general
  registration of securities other than Form S-8 or Form S-4) for
  the registration of Common Shares, then the Company will permit
  (subject to the limitations described below) up to 187,500 Common
  Shares originally issued to the Behrens Stockholders in the
  Behrens Acquisition to be included in such registration statement
  at the request of Behrens Stockholders;


       (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Common Shares to be
  included in a registration at the request of Behrens
  Stockholders, when combined with Common Shares included in such
  registration at the request of former stockholders of Solomons
  Company (as permitted in Section 5.3(d) of the Solomons Agreement and
  Plan of Reorganization dated April 24, 1993) will not exceed 10%
  of the total number of Common Shares covered by such registration
  (the "10% Allocation"), except (with respect to Behrens
  Stockholders only) as specified to the contrary below;


        (iv) During the period from the consummation of the
  Behrens Acquisition through May 4, 1995, former stockholders of
  Solomons ("Solomons Stockholders") will have priority over
  Behrens Stockholders with respect to the 10% Allocation.  After
  May 4, 1995, and for the balance of the Covered Period, only the
  Behrens Stockholders will be entitled to the 10% Allocation,
  subject to the limitations herein;




                                     - 2 -


<PAGE>   39
           (v) In connection with the foregoing, the Initial Holders
  hereby covenant that any requests they make for Required
  Registrations during the Covered Period will be such that the
  reasonably anticipated gross proceeds at the time of the initial
  request allocable to the 10% Allocation, together with the
  reasonably anticipated gross proceeds allocable to any additional
  Common Shares the Initial Holders permit the Behrens Stockholders
  to include in such Required Registration, will not be less than
  $7 million, reduced by any portion of the 10% Allocation actually
  elected by the Solomons Stockholders on Required Registrations
  initiated by the Initial Holders during the Covered Period.  The
  provisions of this subparagraph (v) will not apply to the benefit
  of, nor will it increase the amount of Common Shares registerable
  by, the Solomons Stockholders; moreover, nor will the Behrens
  Stockholders be permitted to include more than 187,500 Common
  Shares originally delivered to them in any such required
  registration.


          (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
  elsewhere in this Section 6(a), the Behrens Registration Rights
  will terminate on the earliest of (a) the second anniversary of
  the consummation of the Behrens Acquisition, (b) the registration
  of an aggregate of 187,500 Common Shares on behalf of the Behrens
  Stockholders, and (c) the date on which the Behrens Stockholders
  are provided with the opportunity to register under the
  Securities Act to sell or offer to sell an aggregate of 187,500
  Common Shares (including any Common Shares previously registered
  and sold by the Behrens Stockholders or as to which the Behrens
  Stockholders have previously been provided the right to register)
  and decline to include such Common Shares in such registration;
  provided, however, this clause (c) shall not apply if the
  registration statement filed with the SEC in connection with such
  registration is not declared effective by the SEC."


          The Original Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, remains
in full force.


          This Amendment may be executed in multiple counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same Amendment.

                          CARDINAL DISTRIBUTION, INC.
                              STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN



SECTION 1.  PURPOSES OF PLAN.
            -----------------

          The purposes of the Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") of Cardinal
Distribution, Inc. (the "Company") are to advance the interests of the Company
and its shareholders by providing a means of attracting and retaining key
employees for the Company and its subsidiaries, providing key employees with
a proprietary interest in the Company, and stimulating the interest of key
employees in the development and financial success of the Company.


SECTION 2.  ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN.
            -----------------------

          The Plan shall be administered by the Company's Compensation
Committee (the "Committee") which shall consist of not less than three
directors of the Company appointed by the Company's Board of Directors (the
"Board").  The members of the Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the
Board, which may remove members from the Committee or appoint new members to
the Committee from time to time, and members of the Committee may resign by
written notice to the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary of the Company.
Each member of the Committee shall be a "disinterested person" within the
meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The
Committee may adopt any rules it considers appropriate for the conduct of its
business or the administration of the Plan, make interpretations of the Plan
which it deems consistent with the Plan's provisions, take any other actions
it considers appropriate in connection with the Plan, and shall have such
additional authority as the Board may determine to be desirable from time
to time.


          No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any
action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any
award under the Plan.  The members of the Committee and other members of the
Board shall be indemnified by the Company against all costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding
to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or
failure to act under or in connection with the Plan, or any award granted
thereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof
(provided such settlement is approved by legal counsel selected by the Company)
or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgement in any such action, suit, or
proceeding, except a judgement based upon a finding of bad faith.  Upon the
institution of any such action, suit, or proceeding, the Board or Committee
member shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof at its expense.  The provisions of this
paragraph with respect to the liability and indemnification of members of the
Board and the Committee are in addition to, and not in limitation of, the
provisions with respect to the liability and indemnification of members of the
Board and the Committee (a) contained in the Articles of Incorporation or Code
of Regulations of the Company, (b) contained in any indemnification agreements
between Directors and the Company, or (c) provided by law.


                                     -1-

<PAGE>   2
SECTION 3.  SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN.
            -----------------------

          The maximum aggregate number of Common Shares, without par value, of
the Company (the "Shares") with respect to which awards may be made under the
Plan shall be 300,000 Shares.  Such Shares may be authorized but unissued
Shares or issued Shares reacquired by the Company and held as treasury Shares.
If any Shares awarded under the Plan are forfeited or an option for Shares
granted under the Plan expires or terminates such forfeited Shares and the
Shares subject to such expired or terminated option shall again be available to
be awarded under the Plan.  The aggregate number of Shares shall be subject to
adjustment under Section 6.


SECTION 4.  PARTICIPANTS IN PLAN.
            ---------------------

          The persons eligible to receive awards under the Plan ("Eligible
Persons") shall include officers and other key employees of the Company or its
subsidiary corporations and in the case of Nonqualified Options and Restricted
Shares, directors of subsidiaries of the Company who, in the opinion of the
Committee, have responsibilities affecting the management, development, or
financial success of the Company or one or more of its subsidiary corporations.


SECTION 5.  AWARDS.
            -------

(a) GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AWARDS.  The Committee shall have the
authority to make awards of the following:  (i) options for Shares intended to
qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the "Code"), as provided in Section 5(b) ("Incentive Options")
(ii) options for Shares not intended to qualify as incentive stock options
under Section 422A of the Code as provided in Section 5(c) ("Nonqualified
Options") (Incentive Options and Nonqualified Options collectively, "Options"),
and (iii) contingent awards of Shares as provided in Section 5(d) ("Restricted
Shares").  The Committee shall designate from time to time, in its discretion,
the Eligible Persons to whom awards shall be granted (such persons, "Grantees")
under the Plan, the number of Shares which shall be subject of each award under
the Plan and the terms and conditions under which an award is made under the
Plan.  All actions of the Committee under this section shall be conclusive, and
no Eligible Person shall have a right to any award unless, and except to the
extent, so designated by the Committee.


          (b) INCENTIVE OPTIONS.  Only officers and other key employees of
the Company or its subsidiary corporations shall be eligible for awards of
Incentive Options.  The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of
the grant of the Option) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Options
are exercisable for the first time by any Eligible Person during any calendar
year (under all incentive stock option plans of his employer corporation and
its parent and subsidiary corporations) shall not exceed $100,000.  All
Incentive Options granted under the Plan shall be granted within 10 years from
the date the Plan is adopted or the date the Plan is approved by the share-
holders of the Company, whichever is earlier.  The Committee may, as a
condition of granting any Option, require that a Grantee agree to surrender for


                                     -2-

<PAGE>   3
cancellation one or more Options previously granted to such Grantee.  Each
Incentive Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be authorized by the
Committee and shall be evidenced by a written Incentive Option Agreement, in
form approved by the Committee, which shall be dated as of the date on which
the Option is granted, signed by an officer of the Company authorized by the
Committee, and signed by the Grantee.  The date on which the Committee approves
the granting of the Incentive Option shall be deemed the date on which the
Incentive Option is granted.  The Incentive Option Agreement shall be
consistent with the Plan, and shall include, without limitation, the following
provisions:


                      (i) TERM.  An Incentive Option, by its terms, shall not be
              exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date an
              Incentive Option is granted.   If the Grantee, at the time the
              Option is granted, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the
              total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the
              employer corporation or its parent or subsidiary corporation,
              the Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of five
              years from the date the Option is granted.


                     (ii) PURCHASE PRICE.  The option price of Shares subject to
              an Incentive Option shall be not less than the fair market value
              of the Shares at the time the Incentive Option is granted.   If
              the Grantee, at the time the Incentive Option is granted, owns
              stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting
              power of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or its
              parent or a subsidiary corporation, the option price shall be at
              least 110% of the fair market value of the Shares subject to the
              Incentive Option.  For purposes of this Section 5(b)(ii), the fair
              market value of the Shares subject to the Incentive Option shall
              be the last sale price of the Shares as reported on the National
              Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System,
              National Market Issues, or, if the Shares are listed or admitted
              for trading on any national securities exchange, the last sale
              price, or the closing bid price if no sale occurred, on the date
              the Incentive Option is awarded.


                    (iii) TRANSFERABILITY.  The Incentive Option, by its
              terms, shall not be transferable by the Grantee other than by
              will or the laws of descent and distribution.  During the
              lifetime of the Grantee, the Incentive Option, by its terms,
              shall be exercisable (subject to any other applicable restric-
              tions on exercise) only by the Grantee for his own account.
              Upon the death of the Grantee, the Incentive Option shall be
              exercisable (subject to any other applicable restrictions on
              exercise) only by the executor or administrator of the Grantee's
              estate.

<PAGE>   4
                    (iv) METHOD OF EXERCISE.   To the extent that the right to
               exercise the Incentive Option has accrued under the restric-
               tions, if any, in the Incentive Option Agreement, the Incentive
               Option shall be exercisable from time to time by written notice
               to the Company stating the number of Shares with respect to
               which the Incentive Option is being exercised and the time
               during normal business hours for delivery of those Shares, which
               shall be more than 15 and less than 30 days after exercise of
               the Incentive Option.  At the specified time, the Company shall
               deliver a certificate for such Shares to the Grantee, at the
               principal office of the Company, upon receipt of payment of the
               full purchase price for such Shares:  (a) by certified or bank
               cashier's check, or (b) in the discretion of the Committee, by
               delivery of Shares with a fair market value equal to the total
               option price at the time of exercise, or (c) in the discretion
               of the Committee, by a combination of the preceding two methods.


                     (v) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  Except as otherwise
               provided in Section 9, if the Grantee ceases to be an employee of
               Company or any of its subsidiary corporations by reason of his
               death, disability, retirement, resignation, replacement or any
               other reason, then the Incentive Option or any unexercised
               portion of the Incentive Option which otherwise is exercisable
               shall terminate unless it is exercised within three months after
               the date the Grantee ceases to be such an employee (but in no
               event after expiration of the original term of the Option);
               provided that if the Grantee ceases to be such an employee by
               reason of the Grantee's death, the three-month period shall
               instead be a one-year period.


                    (vi) RESTRICTIONS.  At the time the Incentive Option is
               granted, the Committee may determine that the Shares subject to
               the Incentive Option shall, upon issuance, be restricted as to
               transferability or be subject to repurchase by the Company upon
               occurrence of certain events determined by the Committee, in its
               discretion, and specified in the Incentive Option Agreement.


                   (vii) DESIGNATION AS INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION.  A provision
               identifying the Incentive Option as a stock option intended to
               qualify as an incentive stock option under 422A of the Code.


          (c) NONQUALIFIED OPTIONS.  Each Nonqualified Option granted pursuant
to the Plan shall be authorized by the Committee and shall be evidenced by a
written Nonqualified Option Agreement, in form approved by the Committee, which
shall be dated as of the date on which the Nonqualified Option is granted,
signed by an officer of the Company authorized by the Committee, and signed by
the Grantee.  The date on which the Committee approves the granting of a Non-
qualified Option shall be deemed the date on which the Nonqualified Option





                                      -4-


<PAGE>   5
is granted.  The Committee may, as a condition of granting any Option, require
that a Grantee agree to surrender for cancellation one or more Options
previously granted to such Grantee.  The Nonqualified Option Agreement shall be
consistent with the Plan, and shall include, without limitation, the following
provisions:


                    (i) TERM.  The Nonqualified Option shall not be exercis-
              able after the expiration of 11 years from the date the
              Nonqualified Option is granted.


                    (ii) PURCHASE PRICE.  The option price shall be any price
              so determined by the Committee.


                    (iii) TRANSFERABILITY.  The Nonqualified Option shall
              not be transferable by the Grantee other than by will or the
              laws of descent and distribution.  During the lifetime of the
              Grantee, the Nonqualified Option shall be exercisable (subject
              to any other applicable restrictions on exercise) only by the
              Grantee for his own account.  Upon the death of the Grantee, the
              Nonqualified Option shall be exercisable (subject to any other
              applicable restrictions on exercise) only by the executor or
              administrator of the Grantee's estate.


                    (iv) METHOD OF EXERCISE.  To the extent that the right to
              exercise the Nonqualified Option has accrued under the restric-
              tions, if any, in the Nonqualified Option Agreement, the
              Nonqualified Option shall be exercisable from time to time by
              written notice to the Company stating the number of Shares with
              respect to which the Nonqualified Option is being exercised and
              the time during normal business hours for delivery of those
              Shares, which shall be more than 15 and less than 30 days after
              exercise of the Nonqualified Option.  At the specified time,
              the Company shall deliver a certificate for such Shares to the
              Grantee, at the principal office of the Company, upon receipt
              of payment of the full purchase price for such Shares:  (a) by
              certified or bank cashier's check, or (b) in the discretion of
              the Committee, by delivery of Shares with a fair market value
              equal to the total option price at the time of exercise, or (c)
              in the discretion of the Committee, by a combination of the
              preceding two methods.


                    (v) TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP.  Except as provided in     
              Section 9, if the Grantee ceases to be an officer or employee
              of the Company or any of its subsidiary corporations or a
              director of a subsidiary corporation of the Company by reason of
              hia death, disability, retirement, resignation, replacement, or
              any other reason, then the Nonqualified Option or any unexercised
              portion of the Nonqualified Option which otherwise is exercisable
              shall terminate unless it is exercised within three months after
              the





                                      -5-


<PAGE>   6
              date the Grantee ceases to be such an officer, employee or
              director (but in no event after expiration of the original term
              of the Nonqualified Option); provided that if the Grantee ceases
              to be such an officer, employee or director by reason of the
              Grantee's death, the three-month period shall instead be a one-
              year period.


                    (vi) RESTRICTED STOCK.  At the time the Nonqualified Option
              is granted, the Committee may determine that the Shares subject
              to the Option shall, upon issuance, be restricted as to trans-
              ferability or be subject to repurchase by the Company upon
              occurrence of certain events determined by the Committee, in its
              discretion, and specified in the Nonqualified Option Agreement.


                   (vii) DESIGNATION AS NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION.  A
              provision identifying the Nonqualified Option as a stock option
              not intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under
              Section 422A of the Code.


          (d) RESTRICTED SHARES.  Restricted Shares granted pursuant to the
Plan shall be authorized by the Committee and shall be evidenced by a written
Restricted Shares Agreement, in form approved by the Committee, which shall be
dated as of the date on which the Restricted Shares are granted, signed by an
officer of the Company authorized by the Committee, and signed by the Grantee.
The date on which the Committee approves the granting of Restricted Shares
shall be deemed the date on which the Restricted Shares are granted.  At the
time of an award of Restricted Shares, the Committee shall establish a period
of time with respect to such Restricted Shares (the "Restricted Period") during
which or at the expiration of which such Restricted Shares shall vest in the
Grantee.  The Restricted Shares Agreement shall be consistent with the Plan
and shall include, without limitation, the following provisions:


                    (i) PURCHASE PRICE.  The purchase price, if any, of the
              Restricted Shares shall be any price so determined by the
              Committee.


                    (ii) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.  Grantees of Restricted Shares
              under the Plan shall generally have all rights of shareholders
              with respect to such Shares from the date of their award
              including, without limitation, the right to receive dividends
              with respect to such Shares and the right to vote such Shares
              but subject, however, to those restrictions placed on such
              Shares pursuant to this Plan and as specified by the Committee
              in the Restricted Shares Agreement.  If the Grantee's
              Continuous Service (as hereinafter defined) terminates prior to 
              the date the Restricted Shares (or any portion thereof) vest, 
              then those unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited and 
              returned to the Company, subject to the provisions of Section 
              5(d) (iii) or Section 14, below.





                                      -6-


<PAGE>   7
                      (iii) TRANSFERABILITY.  During any applicable
               Restricted Period, the Restricted Shares shall not be trans-
               ferable by the Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent
               and distribution.   If a Grantee ceases to maintain Continuous
               Service (as hereinafter defined) by reason of the Grantee's
               death or total or partial disability, then the restrictions with
               respect to a ratable portion of the Restricted Shares shall
               lapse and such Shares shall be free of restrictions and shall
               not be forfeited unless the Committee has specified to the
               contrary in the Restricted Shares Agreement.  Such ratable
               portion shall be determined with respect to each separate award
               of Restricted Shares and shall be equal to (i) the number of
               Restricted Shares awarded to the Grantee multiplied by the
               portion of the Restricted Period that had expired at the date of
               the Grantee's death or total or partial disability, reduced by
               (ii) the number of Restricted Shares awarded with respect to
               which the restrictions had lapsed as of the date of the death or
               total or partial disability of the Grantee.  For purposes of the
               Plan, "Continuous Service" shall mean the absence of any inter-
               ruption or termination of service as an employee of the Company
               or a subsidiary of the Company or as a director of a subsidiary
               of the Company.  At the time the Restricted Shares are awarded,
               the Committee may determine that such Shares shall, after
               vesting, be further restricted as to transferability or be
               subject to repurchase by the Company upon occurrence of certain
               events determined by the Committee, in its discretion, and
               specified in the Restricted Shares Agreement.


SECTION 6.  CHANGE IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.
            ----------------------------

          In the event the Company changes its outstanding Shares by reason of
stock splits, stock dividends, or any other increase or reduction of the number
of outstanding Shares without receiving consideration in the form of money,
services, or property, the aggregate number of Shares subject to the Plan shall
be proportionately adjusted and the number of Restricted Shares awarded and the
number of Shares and the option price for each Share subject to the unexercised
portion of any then-outstanding Option shall be proportionately adjusted with
the objective that the Grantee's proportionate interest in the Company shall
remain the same as before the change and, with respect to outstanding Options,
without any change in the total option price applicable to the unexercised
portion of such Options.


          In the event of any other recapitalization or any merger, consolida-
tion, or other reorganization of the Company, the Committee shall make such
adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate to accurately reflect the number
and kind of Shares deliverable, and the option prices payable, upon subsequent
exercise of any then-outstanding Options.





                                      -7-


<PAGE>   8
          The Committee's determination of the adjustments appropriate to be
made under this Section 6 shall be conclusive upon all Grantees and other
participants under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6 
to the contrary, any adjustment made under this Section 6 with respect to 
Incentive Options shall be made in a manner that will not constitute a 
"modification" within the meaning defined in Section 425 of the Code.


Section 7.  DELIVERY AND REGISTRATION OF STOCK.
            -----------------------------------

          The Company's obligation to deliver Shares with respect to an award
shall, if the Committee so requests, be conditioned upon the receipt of a
representation as to the investment intention of the Grantee to whom such
Shares are to be delivered, in such form as the Committee shall determine to be
necessary or advisable to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 or any other applicable federal or state securities legislation.   It may
be provided that any representation requirement shall become inoperative upon
a registration of the Shares or other action eliminating the necessity of such
representation under such Securities Act or other securities legislation.  The
Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares under the Plan prior to
(i) the admission of such Shares to listing on any stock exchange or system on
which Shares may then be listed, and (ii) the completion of such registration
or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law, rule or
regulation, as the Committee shall determine to be necessary or advisable.
Each certificate for Shares issued pursuant to the Plan shall be registered in
the name of the Grantee, shall bear appropriate legend(s) with respect to the
restrictions upon such Shares and shall, with respect to Restricted Shares, be
deposited by the Grantee together with a stock power endorsed in blank with the
Company until such time as all of such Restricted Shares have vested in the
Grantee thereof.


Section 8.  EFFECT OF CHANGE IN CONTROL.
            ----------------------------

          If the Continuous Service of a Grantee is involuntarily terminated,
for whatever reason, at any time within 18 months after a Change in Control (as
hereinafter defined) then, unless with respect to a Grantee the Committee shall
have otherwise provided in the agreement pursuant to which an award under the
Plan was made to such Grantee, all Shares awarded as Restricted Shares shall
thereupon become fully vested in such Grantee to whom such Shares were
awarded.  If a tender offer or exchange offer for Shares (other than such an
offer by the Company or approved by the Company's Board of Directors) is
commenced, or if the event specified in clause (iii) of the definition of a
Change in Control shall occur and shall not have been approved by the Company's
Board of Directors, unless with respect to a Grantee the Committee shall have
otherwise provided in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Option to such
Grantee, all Options theretofore granted and not fully exercisable shall
(except as otherwise provided in Section 5(b)) thereupon become exercisable 
in full upon the happening of such event and shall remain so exercisable in 
accordance with their terms; provided, however, that no Option shall be 
exercisable by an officer of the Company within six months of the date of 
grant of such Option





                                      -8-


<PAGE>   9
and no Option which has previously been exercised or otherwise
terminated shall become exercisable.   "Change in Control" -- means each of
the events specified in the following clauses (i) through (iii): (i) any third
person, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 shall, after the date of the adoption of the Plan by the
Board, first become the beneficial owner of shares of the Company with respect
to which 25% or more of the total number of votes for the election of the Board
may be cast, (ii) as a result of, or in connection with, any cash tender
offer, exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets
or contested election, or combination of the foregoing, the persons who shall
cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or
(iii) the stockholders of the Company shall approve an agreement providing
either for a transaction in which the Company will cease to be an independent
publicly owned entity or for a sale or other disposition of all or substan-
tially all the assets of the Company; provided, however, that the occurrence of
any of such events shall not be deemed a Change in Control if, prior to such
occurrence, a resolution specifically approving such occurrence shall have been
adopted by the Company's Board of Directors.


SECTION 9. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.
      ----------------------

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or in any
agreement in respect of an award under the Plan, upon the discharge for cause
of any Grantee, all unexercised Options awarded to such Grantee shall lapse.


SECTION 10. WITHHOLDING TAX.
      ----------------

     The Company shall have the right to require the Grantee of Restricted
Shares or other person receiving such Shares to pay the Company the amount of
any taxes which the Company is required to withhold with respect to such Shares
or, in lieu thereof, to retain, or sell without notice, a sufficient number of
such Shares held by it to cover the amount required to be withheld. The
Company shall have the right to deduct from all dividends paid with respect
to Restricted Shares the amount of any taxes which the Company is required to
withhold with respect to such dividend payments.


     The Company shall also have the right to require a Grantee who is
entitled to receive Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option to pay to the
Company the amount of any taxes which the Company is required to withhold with
respect to such Shares, or, in lieu thereof, to retain, or sell without notice,
a number of such Shares sufficient to cover the amount required to be withheld.


SECTION 11. LOANS.
      ------

     (a) The Company may make loans to a Grantee in connection with
Restricted Shares, or in connection with the exercise of Options, subject to
the following terms and conditions and such other terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan, including the rate of interest, if any, as the
Committee shall impose from time to time.


     (b) No loan made under the Plan shall exceed:





                   -9-


<PAGE>   10
                     (1) With respect to Options, the sum of (i) the aggregate
               option price payable upon exercise of the Option with respect to
               which the loan is made, plus (ii) the amount of the reasonably
               estimated income taxes payable by the Grantee.


                     (2) With respect to Restricted Shares, the amount of the
               reasonably estimated income taxes payable by the Grantee.


In no event may any such loan exceed the market value of the Shares in respect
of which the loan is made at the time of the loan.  Loans under the Plan may be
satisfied by the Grantee, as determined by the Committee, in cash or, with the
consent of the Committee, in whole or in part in Shares.


SECTION 12. NO ENLARGEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.
            ------------------------------------

          The award of Shares under the Plan to an employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries shall not confer any right to the employee to continue
in the employ of the Company or any such subsidiary and shall not restrict or
interfere in any way with the right of his employer to terminate his employ-
ment, with or without cause, at any time.  The award of Shares under the Plan
to a director of a subsidiary of the Company shall not confer any right to such
director to continue as a director of a subsidiary of the Company and shall not
restrict or interfere in any way with the right of the shareholder of such
Company to terminate such directorship, with or without cause, at any time.


SECTION 13. RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDER.
            ----------------------

          No Grantee or his executor or administrator shall have any rights of
a shareholder in the Company with respect to the Shares covered by an Option
unless and until a certificate representing such Shares has been duly issued
and delivered to him under the Plan.


SECTION l4. ACCELERATION OF RIGHTS.
            -----------------------

          The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to
accelerate the time at which an Option shall be exercisable and to accelerate
the time at which any or all of the restrictions shall lapse with respect to
any Restricted Shares or to remove any or all of such restrictions, whenever it
may determine that such action is appropriate by reason of changes in applic-
able tax or other laws or other changes in circumstances occurring after the
award of such Options or of Restricted Shares.


SECTION 15. DEFINITION OF SUBSIDIARY.
            -------------------------

          The term "subsidiary corporation" when used in the Plan or any stock
option agreement made pursuant to the Plan means a subsidiary corporation as
defined in Section 425 of the Code.

                          CARDINAL DISTRIBUTION, INC.
                          ---------------------------
                          DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN
                          ----------------------------
                            AS AMENDED AND RESTATED
                            -----------------------


SECTION 1.   PURPOSE.
             --------

        The purpose of the Cardinal Distribution, Inc. Directors' Stock Option
Plan, as Amended and Restated (the "'Plan'") is to encourage those directors of
Cardinal Distribution, Inc. (the "Company") who are not employees of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to acquire a proprietary interest in the
Company, to further promote the interest of such directors in the development
and financial success of the Company, and to assist the Company in attracting
and retaining highly qualified directors.


SECTION 2.   ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN.
             -----------------------

        The Plan shall be administered by the Company's Compensation Committee
(the "Committee") which shall consist of not less than three directors of the
Company appointed by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). The
members of the Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board, which may
remove members from the Committee or appoint new members to the Committee from
time to time, and members of the Committee may resign by written notice to the
Chairman of the Board or the Secretary of the Company. The Committee may adopt
any rules it considers appropriate for the conduct of its business or the
administration of the Plan, make interpretations of the Plan which it deems
consistent with the Plan's provisions, take any other actions it considers
appropriate in connection with the Plan, and shall have such additional
authority as the Board may determine to be desirable from time to time.  The
decisions of the Committee on matters within its jurisdiction under the Plan
shall be conclusive and binding.


        No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any action
or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award under
the Plan. The members of the Committee and other members of the Board shall be
indemnified by the Company against all costs and expenses reasonably incurred
by them in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding to which they or any
of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or
in connection with the Plan, or any award granted thereunder, and against all
amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is
approved by legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in
satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding, except a
judgment based upon a finding of bad faith. Upon the institution of any such
action, suit, or proceeding, the Board or Committee member shall promptly
notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof at its expense. The provisions of this paragraph with
respect to the liability and indemnification of members of the Board and the
Committee are in addition to, and not in limitation of, the provisions with
respect to the liability and indemnification of members of the Board and the
Committee (a) contained in the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations
of the Company, (b) contained in any indemnification agreements between
Directors and the Company, or (c) provided by law.


SECTION 3.   SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN.
             -----------------------

        The maximum aggregate number of Common Shares, without par value, of
the Company (the "Shares") allocated to the Plan and available for options
shall be 500,000 Shares.  Such Shares may be authorized but unissued Shares or
issued Shares reacquired by the Company and held as treasury Shares. If an
option for Shares granted under the Plan expires or terminates, the Shares
subject to such expired or terminated option shall again be available to be
awarded under the Plan.  The aggregate number of Shares allocated to the Plan
shall be subject to adjustment under Section 6.


<PAGE>   2
SECTION 4.  ELIGIBILITY.
            -----------

        Only an individual who is a director of the Company and not an employee
of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is eligible to participate in
this Plan (each such individual an "Eligible Director").


SECTION 5.  REQUIRED TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS.
            -----------------------------------------

        Options to purchase Shares granted under the Plan (an "Option") shall
be Options not intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). All options to
purchase Shares granted under the Plan ("Options") shall be evidenced by a
written agreement in such form as the Committee shall from time to time
approve, which shall be dated as of the date on which an Option is granted,
signed by an officer of the Company authorized by the Committee, and signed by
the Grantee. Any such agreements shall be consistent with the Plan and comply
with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:


        (a)     VESTING. All Options shall be fully vested on the date of
    grant.



        (b)     NUMBER OF SHARES. Each individual first elected to serve as a
    director of the Company after the Effective Date of this Plan who is an
    Eligible Director shall, upon such election, automatically be granted
    Options for that number of Shares having a fair market value of $100,000
    (Eligible Directors granted Options hereunder, "Grantees.") The fair market
    value of the Shares shall be the last sale price of the Shares as reported
    on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
    System, National Market Issues, or, if the Shares are listed or admitted
    for trading on any national securities exchange, the last sale price, or
    the closing bid price if no sale occurred, on the date the Option is
    granted. In addition, commencing immediately after the adjournment of the
    Company's annual meeting of shareholders (an "Annual Meeting") in 1993 and
    continuing on an annual basis immediately following the adjournment of each
    succeeding Annual Meeting thereafter during the term of this Plan, each
    Eligible Director whose term did not expire at that Annual Meeting and who
    has then served as a director of the Company for a consecutive period of
    time which includes each of the last three Annual Meetings (i.e., including
    the Annual Meeting then just adjourned) shall automatically be granted
    additional Options for that number of Shares having a fair market value of
    $50,000.
        

        (c)     OPTION PRICE. The option price of Shares subject to Options
    shall be the fair market value of the Shares at the time the Option is
    granted. The fair market value of the Shares shall be the last sale price
    of the Shares as reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers
    Automated Quotation System, National Market Issues, or, if the Shares are
    listed or admitted for trading on any national securities exchange, the
    last sale price, or the closing bid price if no sale occurred, on the date
    the Option is granted.
        

        (d)     MAXIMUM TERM. No options issued under the Plan may be exercised
     more than ten years from the date of grant.


        (e)     TERMINATION OF OPTION. Except as otherwise provided in Section
    7, if a Grantee ceases to be an Eligible Director for any reason, then all
    Options or any unexercised portion of such Options which otherwise are
    exercisable by such Grantee shall terminate unless such Options are
    exercised within six months after the date such Grantee ceases to be an
    Eligible Director (but in no event after expiration of the original term of
    any such Option); provided, that if such Grantee ceases to be an Eligible
    Director by reason of such Grantee's death, the six-month period shall
    instead be a one-year period.
        

        (f)     TRANSFERABILITY. No Option shall be transferable by a Grantee   
    other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. During the
    lifetime of a Grantee, an Option, by its terms, shall be exercisable
    (subject to any other applicable restrictions on exercise) only by a
    Grantee for his own account. Upon the death of a Grantee, an Option shall
    be exercisable (subject to any other applicable restrictions on exercise)
    only by the executor or administrator of a Grantees's estate.
        

        (g)     METHOD OF EXERCISE. Options may be exercised from time to time
    by giving written notice to the Treasurer of the Company (the date such
    notice is received by the Company, the "Exercise
        
        

<PAGE>   3
        Date"), stating the number of Shares with respect to which an Option is
    being exercised and the time during normal business hours for delivery of
    the Shares with respect to which an Option was exercised, which shall be
    more than 15 and less than 30 days after the Exercise Date. At the
    specified time, the Company shall deliver, at the principal office of the
    Company, a certificate for such Shares to the Grantee upon receipt of
    payment of the full purchase price for such Shares:  (i) by certified or
    bank cashier's check, (ii) by delivery of Shares with a fair market value
    equal to the total option price at the time of exercise or (iii) by a
    combination of the proceeding two methods. Any Shares delivered in payment
    of an option price shall be valued as of the Exercise Date.
        
SECTION 6.  CHANGE IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.
            ----------------------------

        In the event the Company changes its outstanding Shares by reason of
stock splits, stock dividends, or any other increase or reduction of the number
of outstanding Shares without receiving consideration in the form of money,
services, or property, the aggregate number of Shares subject to the Plan shall
be proportionately adjusted and the number of Shares and the option price for
each Share subject to the unexercised portion of any then-outstanding Option
shall be proportionately adjusted with the objective that the Grantee's
proportionate interest in the Company shall remain the same as before the
change and, with respect to outstanding Options, without any change in the
total option price applicable to the unexercised portion of such Options.


        In the event of any other recapitalization or any merger,
consolidation, or other reorganization of the Company, the Committee shall make
such adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate to accurately refiect the
number and kind of Shares deliverable, and the option prices payable, upon
subsequent exercise of any then-outstanding Options.


        The Committee's determination of the appropriate adjustments to be made
under this Section 6 shall be conclusive upon all grantees and other
participants under the Plan.


SECTION 7.  TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.
            ---------------------

        Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or in any
agreement in respect of an award under the Plan,upon the discharge of any
Grantee as a director of the Company for cause, all unexercised Options awarded
to such Grantee shall immediately lapse and be of no farther force or effect.


SECTION 8.  TAX WITHHOLDING.
            ---------------

        The Company shall have the right to require a Grantee who is entitled
to receive Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option to pay to the Company
the amount of any taxes which the Company is required to withhold with respect
to such Shares, or, in lieu thereof, to retain, or sell without notice, a
number of such Shares sufficient to cover the amount required to be withheld.


SECTION 9.  TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF PLAN.
            ----------------------------------

        The Board of Directors of the Company, without further action on the
part of the shareholders, may from time to time alter, amend or suspend the
Plan or may at any time terminate the Plan, provided that (a) no such action
shall materially and adversely affect any outstanding Options without the
consent of the respective Grantees; (b) the provisions of the Plan governing
the matters set forth in Rule 16b-3(c)(2)(ii)(A) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), shall not be amended more than once
every six months, except as otherwise permitted under Rule 16b-3(c)(2)(ii)(B)
of the 1934 Act; and (c) except for the adjustments provided for in Section 6
hereof, no amendment may be made solely by Board action if the amendment would
(i) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan;
(ii) increase or decrease the number of Shares which may be issued under the
Plan, or (iii) materially modify the eligibility requirements of the Plan.


SECTION 10. DELIVERY AND REGISTRATION OF STOCK.
            ----------------------------------

        The Company's obligation to deliver Shares with respect to the exercise
of an Option shall, if the Committee so requests, be conditioned upon the
receipt of a representation as to the investment intention of the Grantee to
whom such Shares are to be delivered, in such form as the Committee shall
determine to be necessary or advisable to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 or any other applicable federal or state securities
legislation.  It may be provided that any representation requirement shall
become

<PAGE>   4
inoperative upon a registration of the Shares or other action
eliminating the necessity of such representation under such Securities Act or
other securities legislation. The Company shall not be required to deliver any
Shares under the Plan prior to (i) the admission of such Shares to listing on
any stock exchange or system on which Shares may then be listed, and (ii) the
completion of such registration or other qualification of such Shares under any
state or federal law, rule or regulation, as the Committee shall determine to
be necessary or advisable.  Each certificate for Shares issued pursuant to the
Plan shall be registered in the name of the Grantee and shall bear appropriate
legend(s) with respect to the restrictions upon such Shares.


SECTION 11. NO ENLARGEMENT OF RIGHTS.
            -------------------------

        The award of Options under the Plan to an Eligible Director shall not
confer any right to such director to continue as a director of the Company and
shall not restrict or interfere in any way with the right of the shareholders
of the Company to terminate such directorship, with or without cause, at any
time.


SECTION 12. RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDER.
            ---------------------

        No Grantee or his executor or administrator shall have any rights of a
shareholder in the Company with respect to the Shares covered by an Option
unless and until a certificate representing such Shares has been duly issued
and delivered to him under the Plan.


SECTION  13. DEFINITION OF SUBSIDIARY.
             ------------------------

        The term "subsidiary" when used in the Plan or any Option agreement
made pursuant to the Plan means a subsidiary corporation as defined in Section
424 of the Code.

SECTION 14. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.
            ----------------------

        Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan or any agreement made
pursuant to the Plan, the Company's obligations under the Plan and any such
agreement shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to
such approvals as may be required by any governmental or regulatory agencies.


SECTION 15. GOVERNING LAW.
            -------------

        The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and be governed by the
laws of the State of Ohio.


SECTION 16. GENDERS AND NUMBERS.
            -------------------

        When permitted by the context, each pronoun used in the Plan includes
the same pronoun in other genders and numbers.


SECTION 17. CAPTIONS.
            ---------

        The captions of the various sections of the Plan are not part of the
context of the Plan, but are only labels to assist in locating those sections,
and shall be ignored in construing the Plan.

            ---------------

        The Plan shall be effective on May 19, 1993 (the "Effective Date"). 
The Plan shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval and

                              -------------------


         THIS INDEMNITY AGREEMENT, effective as of February 9,
1993, between WHITMIRE DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Corporation"), and the undersigned indemnitee
("Indemnitee"),


                              W I T N E S S E T H:


         WHEREAS Indemnitee is either a member of the board of
directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors"), or an
officer of the Corporation, or both, and in such capacity or
capacities, or otherwise as an Agent of the Corporation (as
hereinafter defined) is performing a valuable service for the
Corporation; and


         WHEREAS Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to
serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the
Corporation on the condition that he be indemnified as herein
provided; and


         WHEREAS it is intended that Indemnitee shall be paid
promptly by the Corporation all amounts necessary to effectuate
in full the indemnity provided herein:



         N o w, T h e r e f o r e, in consideration of the
premises and the covenants in this Agreement, and of Indemnitee
continuing to serve the Corporation as an Agent and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:


         1.    SERVICES BY INDEMNITEE.
               -----------------------

         Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director or as an
officer of the Corporation, or both, so long as he is duly
appointed or elected and qualified in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation, and until such
time as he resigns or fails to stand for election or is removed
from his position.  Indemnitee may from time to time also
perform other services at the request or for the convenience of,
or otherwise benefiting, the Corporation.  Indemnitee may at any
time and for any reason resign or be removed from such position
(subject to any other contractual obligation or other obligation
imposed by operation of law), in which event the Corporation
shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue
Indemnitee in any such position.

         2.    INDEMNIFICATION.
               ----------------

         Subject to the limitations set forth herein and in
Section 6 hereof, the Corporation hereby agrees to indemnify
Indemnitee as follows:


         The Corporation shall, with respect to any Proceeding
associated with Indemnitee's being an Agent of the Corporation,
indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation in effect on the date hereof or as such laws or
Restated Certificate of Incorporation may from time to time be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than the law or Restated Certificate of
Incorporation permitted the Corporation to provide before such
amendment).  The right to indemnification conferred in the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be presumed to have
been relied upon by Indemnitee in serving or continuing to serve
the Corporation as an Agent and shall be enforceable as a
contract right.  Without in any way diminishing the scope of the
indemnification provided by this Section 2, the Corporation
will, to the greatest extent permitted by law or the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, indemnify Indemnitee if and
whenever he is or was a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any Proceeding, including without limitation any such
Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation, by
reason of the fact that he is or was an Agent or by reason of
anything done or not done by him in such capacity, against
Expenses and Liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with the
investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such Proceeding.
In addition to, and not as a limitation of, the foregoing, the
rights of indemnification of Indemnitee provided under this
Agreement shall include those rights set forth in Sections 3 and
8 below.


         3.   ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.
              ------------------------

         All reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee shall be advanced from time to time by the
Corporation to him within thirty (30) days after the receipt by
the Corporation of a written request for an advance of Expenses,
whether prior to or after final disposition of a Proceeding
(except to the extent that there has been a Final Adverse
Determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
for such Expenses), including without limitation any Proceeding
brought by or in the right of the Corporation.  The written


One of Two Counterpart Originals

Page 3 of 13 Pages


request for an advancement of any and all Expenses under this
Section 3(a) shall contain reasonable detail of the Expenses
incurred by Indemnitee.  By execution of this Agreement,
Indemnitee shall be deemed to have made whatever undertaking may
be required with respect to repayment to the Corporation of such
Expenses under applicable provisions of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as from time to time amended;
provided, however, that in no circumstances shall Indemnitee be
deemed to have undertaken to repay the Corporation for Expenses
as to which Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder.


          4.   PRESUMPTIONS AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.
               -----------------------------------------------

          Upon making a request for indemnification, Indemnitee
shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement and the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to
overcome that presumption in reaching any contrary deter-
mination.  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, arbitration award or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not affect this
presumption or, except as may be provided in Section 6 hereof,
establish a presumption with regard to any factual matter
relevant to determining Indemnitee's rights to indemnification
hereunder.  If the person or persons so empowered to make a
determination pursuant to Section 5 hereof shall have failed to
make the requested determination within ninety (90) days after
any judgment, order, settlement, dismissal, arbitration award,
conviction, acceptance of plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, or other disposition or partial disposition of any
Proceeding or any other event which could enable the Corporation
to determine Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, the
requisite determination that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification shall be deemed to have been made.


          5.   PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO
               ---------------------------------------------
INDEMNIFICATION.
- - ---------------

          (a) Whenever Indemnitee believes that he is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee shall
submit a written request for indemnification to the Corporation.
Any request for indemnification shall include sufficient
documentation or information reasonably available to Indemnitee
for the determination of entitlement to indemnification.  The
Secretary, General Counsel or other appropriate officer shall,
promptly upon receipt of Indemnitee's request for
indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that
he has made such request.  Determination of Indemnitee's
entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than

Page 4 of 13 Pages


ninety (90) days after such request for indemnification,
provided that any request for indemnification for Liabilities,
other than amounts paid in settlement, shall have been made
after a determination thereof in a Proceeding.


          (b) The Corporation shall be entitled to select the
forum in which Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification will
be heard; provided, however, that if there is a Change in
Control of the Corporation, Independent Legal Counsel or
arbitration shall determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification.  The forum shall be any one of the following:


          (1) the stockholders of the Corporation;


          (2) a quorum of the Board of Directors con-
     sisting of Disinterested Directors;


          (3) Independent Legal Counsel, who shall make
     the determination in a written opinion; or


          (4) a panel of three arbitrators, one selected
     by the Corporation, another by Indemnitee and the
     third by the first two arbitrators selected; or if for
     any reason three arbitrators are not selected within
     thirty (30) days after the appointment of the first
     arbitrator, then selection of additional arbitrators
     shall be made by the American Arbitration Association.
     If any arbitrator resigns or is unable to serve in
     such capacity for any reason, the person who was
     entitled originally to select such arbitrator shall
     select his replacement.  The arbitration shall be
     conducted pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules
     of the American Arbitration Association now in effect.


          6.   SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.
               ----------------------------------------

          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this
Agreement to make any payment to Indemnitee with respect to any
Proceeding:


          (a) to the extent that payment is actually made to
Indemnitee under any insurance policy, or is made to Indemnitee
by the Corporation or an affiliate otherwise than pursuant to
this Agreement (notwithstanding the availability of such
insurance, Indemnitee also may claim indemnification from the
Corporation pursuant to this Agreement by assigning to the

Page 5 of 13 Pages


Corporation any claims under such insurance to the extent
Indemnitee is paid by the Corporation);


         (b) if a court has entered a judgment or other final
adjudication adverse to Indemnitee which establishes that
Indemnitee's acts were not in good faith or not reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation;


         (c) to the extent of any financial advantage to which
Indemnitee is not legally entitled, if so established by a
judgment or other final adjudication adverse to Indemnitee;


         (d) for Liabilities in connection with Proceedings
settled without the Corporation's consent, which consent,
however, shall not be unreasonably withheld;


         (e) for an accounting of profits made from the
purchase or sale by Indemnitee of securities of the Corporation
within the meaning of section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or similar provisions of any state
statutory or common law; or


         (f) to the extent directly attributable to a
violation of law in which Indemnitee had reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful.


         7.   FEES AND EXPENSES OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL.
              -----------------------------------------------

         The Corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of Independent Legal Counsel or a panel of three
arbitrators should such Counsel or such panel of arbitrators be
retained to make a determination of Indemnitee's entitlement to
indemnification pursuant to Section 5(b) of this Agreement, and
to fully indemnify such Counsel or arbitrators against any and
all expenses and losses incurred by any of them arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or their engagement pursuant
hereto.


         8.   REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE.
              ----------------------

         (a) In the event that (1) a determination pursuant to
Section 5(b)(1), 5(b)(2) or 5(b)(3) hereof is made that
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, (2) advances of
Expenses are not made pursuant to this Agreement, (3) payment
has not been timely made following a determination of
entitlement to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, or
(4) Indemnitee otherwise seeks enforcement of this Agreement,

<PAGE>   6
Indemnity Agreement

Page 6 of 13 Pages


Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final adjudication in an
appropriate court of the State of Delaware of the remedy sought.
Alternatively, Indemnitee at his option may seek an award in
arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to
the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
Association now in effect, which award is to be made within
ninety (90) days following the filing of the demand for
arbitration.  In any such proceeding or arbitration Indemnitee
shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement and the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to
overcome that presumption.


          (b) In the event that a determination that Indemnitee
is not entitled to indemnification, in whole or in part, has
been made pursuant to Section 5(b)(1), 5(b)(2) or 5(b)(3)
hereof, the decision in the judicial proceeding or arbitration
provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 8 shall be made de
novo and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a
determination that he is not entitled to indemnification.


          (c) If a determination that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification has been made pursuant to Section 5 hereof, or
is deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 4 hereof or
otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Corporation shall be bound by such determination in the absence
of a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact by Indem-
nitee.


          (d) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting
that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not
valid, binding and enforceable.  The Corporation shall stipulate
in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the
Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and
is precluded from making any assertion to the contrary.


          9.   INSURANCE.
               ----------

          (a) MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE.  Subject only to the
provisions within this Section 9, the Corporation agrees that
during the Indemnification Period (commencing on the effective
date hereof), the Corporation will use its best efforts to
purchase and maintain in effect for the benefit of Indemnitee
one or more valid, binding and enforceable policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be required to maintain
said policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance if
such insurance is not reasonably available or if it is in good

faith determined by the then directors of the Corporation either
that:


          (i) the premium cost of maintaining such insurance is
     substantially disproportionate to the amount of coverage
     provided thereunder; or


          (ii) the protection provided by such insurance is so
     limited by exclusions, deductions or otherwise that there
     is insufficient benefit to warrant the cost of maintaining
     such insurance.


          Anything in this Agreement to the contrary not-
withstanding, to the extent that and for so long as the
Corporation shall choose to continue to maintain any policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance during the
Indemnification Period, the Corporation shall maintain similar
and equivalent insurance for the benefit of Indemnitee during
the Indemnification Period.


          (b) ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION IN LIEU OF INSURANCE.
In the event that the Corporation shall discontinue any policy
or policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
referred to in Section 9(a) or limit in any way the coverages
provided thereunder either in scope or amount, or such policies
or coverages provided thereunder become unavailable in whole or
in part for any reason, the Corporation agrees to hold harmless
and indemnify Indemnitee for the remainder of the
Indemnification Period to the full extent of the coverage which
would otherwise have been provided for the benefit of Indemnitee
had such insurance policies specified in Section 9(a) been
maintained.


          10.  MODIFICATION, WAIVER, TERMINATION AND
               -------------------------------------
CANCELLATION.
- - -------------

          No supplement, modification, termination, cancellation
or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed
in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or
not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing
waiver.


          11.   SUBROGATION.
                ------------

          In the event of payment under this Agreement, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to

all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute
all papers required and shall do everything that may be
necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such
documents necessary to enable the Corporation effectively to
bring suit to enforce such rights.


          12.  NOTICE BY INDEMNITEE AND DEFENSE OF CLAIM.
               ------------------------------------------

          Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Corporation in
writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena,
complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to
any matter, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, but the omission so to notify the Corporation
will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
Indemnitee if such omission does not prejudice the Corporation's
rights.  If such omission does prejudice the Corporation's
rights, the Corporation will be relieved from liability only to
the extent of such prejudice; such omission shall not relieve
the Corporation from any liability which it may have to
Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement.  With respect to
any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Corporation
of the commencement thereof:


          (a) the Corporation will be entitled to participate
therein at its own expense; and


          (b) the Corporation jointly with any other indem-
nifying party similarly notified will be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding if Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded based upon a written opinion of
counsel to Indemnitee that there may be a conflict of interest
between the Corporation and Indemnitee with respect to such
Proceeding.  After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of
its election to assume the defense thereof, the Corporation will
not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any
Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investiga-
tion or as otherwise provided below.  Indemnitee shall have the
right to employ Indemnitee's own counsel in such Proceeding but
the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from
the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall
be at the expense of Indemnitee unless:


          (i)   the employment of counsel by Indemnitee
     has been authorized by the Corporation; or

Page 9 of 13 Pages


          (ii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed
     counsel to assume the defense in such Proceeding or shall
     not in fact have assumed such defense and be acting in
     connection therewith with reasonable diligence;


in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Corporation.


          (c) The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding
in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on
Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent; provided,
however, that Indemnitee will not unreasonably withhold
Indemnitee's consent to any proposed settlement.


          13.  NOTICES.
               --------

          All notices, requests, demands and other communi-

the full amount of all premiums becoming due under the Policy from time to time
and, promptly upon the request of the Employee, shall furnish the Employee with
evidence of the timely payment of the premiums. As soon as practicable after
the end of each calendar year, the Employer shall furnish the Employee with a
statement of the amount of income reportable by the Employee for Federal and
state income tax purposes as a result of the Employer's payment of the premiums
on the Policy during that year.


        SECTION 3.  DEATH BENEFITS.  If the Employee dies before his spouse
dies, then upon the Employee's death the Employer shall be entitied to receive
all proceeds, if any, which are payable under the Term Rider.  Upon the death
of the last-to-die of the Employee and the Employee's spouse, the Employer
shall be entitled to receive from the proceeds of the Policy, after reduction
by any indebtedness to the Insurer secured by the Policy, an amount equal to:
(a) the portion of all premiums pald by the Employer to the Insurer which
relate to the survivorship ordinary life insurance coverage of the Policy plus
an amount equal to a yield calculated at a rate 3% per annum on the outstanding
balance of that portion of those premiums from time to time, compounded annually
as of each anniversary date of the Policy (collectively, the "Employer's
Interest"), plus, (b) all proceeds, if any, which are then payable under the
Term Rider. All proceeds of the Policy which exceed the amount payable to the
Employer under the preceding provisions of this section shall be pald directiy
to the beneficiary designated by the Owner in the manner described in the
beneficiary designation provisions of the Policy.  In no event shall the amount
payable to the Employer under this section exceed the proceeds payable under
the Pmicy.


        SECTION 4.  SURRENDER OF POLICY. If the Policy is surrendered or
cancelled in whole or part at any time before the death of the last-to-die of
the Employee and the Employee's spouse, the Employer shall be entitied to
receive from the cash surrender value of the Policy, after reduction by any
indebtedness to the Insurer secured by the Policy, an amount equal to the
Employer's Interest plus the amount, if any, payable with respect to any
prepald premiums or cash values attributable to the Term Rider.  All amounts
payable upon surrender of the Policy in excess of the amount payable to the
Employer under the preceding sentence shall be paid directly to the Owner.  In
no event shall the amount payable to the Employer under this section exceed the
amounts payable upon surrender of the Policy.


        SECTION 5.  COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT.  The Owner shall collaterally assign
the Policy to the Employer as security for the payment to the Employer of all
amounts to which the Employer is entitled under Section 3 or Section 4 of this
agreement.  The collateral assignment shall be in substantially the form
customarily used for that purpose by commercial banks with any modifications
required by the Insurer. The Employer shall have no right to borrow against the
cash value of the Policy without the consent of the Owner. The Owner shall not
sell, assign, transfer, surrender, cancel, borrow against, or change the
dividend option of, the Policy without the consent of the Employer.

        SECTION 6.  TERMINATION. As of any date, the Employer may elect, by
notice given to the other Parties not later than 30 days before that date, to
terminate its obligation under this agreement to pay any future premiums
attributable to the Term Rider.  In that event:  (a) all rights and economic
benefits of the Employer under this agreement relating to the Term Rider shall
terminate (including without limitation any payments of death benefits
attributable to the Term Rider and any payments upon surrender of the Policy)
as of that date; and (b) the Owner may elect to pay any or all premiums
attributable to the Term Rider and, if so, shall be entitied to all rights and
economic benefits relating to the Term Rider after that date. This paragraph
shall supersede any other provision of this agreement to the contrary.


        This agreement shall terminate as of the earlier of the following
events:  (a) the Employer gives notice to the other Parties terminating this
agreement at any time, or (b) the tenth anniversary date of the Policy. In that
event, the Parties shall surrender the Policy to the Insurer, and the amounts
payable upon such surrender shall be pald as described in Section 4 unless,
within 90 days after the date of termination, the Owner elects to pay the
Employer an amount equal to the Employer's Interest plus the amount, if any, of
any prepaid premiums or other cash values attributable to the Term Rider in
exchange for the Employer's full release and discharge of the collateral
assignment of the Policy and of any other rights and interests of the Employer
under this agreement.  If the Owner elects to make the payment described in the
preceding sentence, the Employer may elect to continue payment of the premiums
attributable to the Term Rider by giving notice of that election to the other
Parties within 30 days after the Owner's election and, in that event,
notwithstanding the preceding provisions, the Employer shall continue to be
entitied to all rights and economic benefits of the Employer under this
agreement relating to the Term Rider, the amount payable by the Owner under the
preceding sentence shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Employer's
Interest, and the Owner shall collaterally assign the Policy to the Employer as
security for the payment to the Employer of all amounts to which the Employer
is entitied under this agreement with respect to the Term Rider, subject to the
provisions in the first paragraph of this section.


        SECTION 7.  ERISA PROVISIONS.  The Employer shall be the "named
fiduciary" of the split-dollar life insurance plan under this agreement, which
shall be the written plan instrument. The named fiduciary shall have the
authority to control and manage the operation and administration of this
agreement and shall be responsible for establishing and carrying out a funding
policy and method consistent with the objectives of this agreement.


        The named fiduciary shall make all determinations concerning rights to
benefits under this agreement. Any decision by the named fiduciary denying a
claim by the Owner or any of its beneficiaries for benefits under this
agreement shall be stated in writing and delivered or mailed to the Owner or
such beneficiary. Any such decision shall set forth the specific reasons for
the denial, written to the best of the named fiduciary's ability in a manner
that may be understood without legal or actuarial counsel. In addition, the
Employer shall afford a reasonable opportunity to the Owner or any such
beneficiary for a full and fair review of the decision denying the claim.

considered a party to this agreement. The Insurer shall be fully discharged
from its obligations under the Policy upon payment of the death benefits or
cash surrender value of the Policy in accordance with the terms of this
agreement.  No provision of this agreement shall be construed as changing or
otherwise affecting the obligations of the Insurer as provided in the Policy,
except to the extent the provisions of this agreement are made a part of the
Policy by the collateral assignment executed by the Owner and filed with the
Insurer under SECTION 5.


        SECTION 9.  EXONERATION OF EMPLOYEE AND OWNER.  If the Employer does
not completely recover the Employer's Interest from the death proceeds or cash
surrender value under Section 3 or Section 4 for any reason, neither the
Employee nor the Owner shall have any liability to the Employer for the
difference between the Employer's Interest and the amounts actually received by
the Employer under this agreement.


        SECTION 10.  EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS. The Parties shall execute and
deliver such forms and other documents and furnish such information as may be
necessary to effectuate the terms of this agreement.  The Employer shall

Employer's Interest at any time for payment of death proceeds or cash surrender
value under this agreement.

governed by the law of Ohio.


        SECTION 13.  CAPTIONS.  The captions at the beginnings of the several

   5.01.  DEFERRAL ELECTION.  Each Participant shall
complete a Deferral Election form, setting forth the amount
of his Deferral Commitment and the duration of his
Commitment Period.  The Deferral Election form shall also
indicate the amount of Covered Compensation which will be
deferred with respect to the remainder of the then current
Plan Year (the "Initial Deferral Period").  In no event may
such amount be less than the greater of $2,500 or 25% of the
Deferral Commitment.  In addition, the Deferral Form will
indicate whether the deferrals will be made from base
compensation, management incentive compensation, or both.
Further, the Deferral Form will indicate whether the
Participant wishes to receive distribution of benefits in a
lump sum, or in reasonably level payments over a five, ten
or fifteen year period.  A Participant's deferrals will be
credited to his Deferred Compensation Account, as described
in Section 5.05, as of the last day of the calendar month in
which the deferral occurs.  A Participant shall be 100%
vested in his Deferred Compensation Account at all times.


   5.02.  SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  After the Initial Deferral
Period, the Participant may select the amount of Covered
Compensation he wishes to defer and the time period over
which he wishes to defer it, by completing a new Deferral
Election form.  There is no requirement that a Participant
make an election to defer compensation in a particular time
period, so long as the entire Deferral Commitment is
satisfied during the Commitment Period.


   5.03.  MAXIMUM DEFERRAL.  A Participant may defer up to
50% of his annual base compensation during any Plan Year.
In addition, a Participant may defer up to 100% of his
management incentive bonus during any Plan Year.  The 50%
limitation shall be increased to 100% with respect to base
compensation paid during November and December, 1990,
provided that the entire deferral amount for the 14-month





                                       7


<PAGE>   12
begining November 1, 1990 does not exceed the 50% limitation.


        5.04.    EFFECTIVE DATES.  A Participant's Deferral Election shall be
effective for a particular Entry Date if it is filed with the Plan Committee no
later than the 15th day of the month immediately preceding the month with
respect to which it is to become effective. A Participant's Deferral Election
with respect to the Plan Year commencing November 1, 1990 shall be effective if
it is filed with the Plan Committee no later than Octobar 31, 1990. A
Participant's Deferral Election for a Plan Year shall become irrevocable for
the portion of the Plan Year to which it relates after the 15th day of the
month immediately preceding the month with respect to which it is to become
effective.


        5.05.    ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS.  Two separate accounts shall be

contributions, if any, shall be credited to the Company Matching Account,
withdrawals, distributions or forfeitures shall be debited to this account, and
(subject to Section 5.06) earnings or losses attributable to investment
elections shall be credited or debited to this account


        5.06.    INVESTMENT DIRECTION.  Each Participant shall be permitted,
not more often than quarterly, to direct the Plan Committee in writing,
utilizing a form to be furnished by the Committee, to credit or debit the
Participant's account balance as though the account assets were actually
invested in one or more mutual funds offered by the Equitable through The
Hudson River Trust in the proportions indicated by the Participant Changes in
such directions shall be effective on the first day of the calendar quarter
following receipt by the Plan Committee of such written instruction provided it
is so received not less than 30 days prior to such date.


             The earnings or losses will be credited or debited to a
Participant's Accounts as if such Accounts were actually invested as directed
by the Participant. Under no circumstance, however, will the Employer or
the Committee by required to invest any portion of the Plan assets in
accordance with the elections submitted by the Participants. The Employer
may choose to do so in order to minimize its risk of loss, however.


        5.07.    COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTION.  Each year the Company will
decide whether it will match a portion or all




                                   8

                        4 or more                  100%


For purposes of this Section 5.08, a Completed Plan Year

shall be deemed to remain a Participant for the duration of

deducting such amount from his current compensation, if any,
the Company shall continue to credit his Deferred
Compensation Account throughout the entire period of his
Disability (but not after December 31, 1994) with the
minimum amount of deferrals necessary to satisfy his

bound by the provisions of the Plan.


   6.09.  NO DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS.  The Pre-Retirement
Survivor Benefit and the Retirement Income Benefit under the
Plan shall be mutually exclusive with respect to each Plan
Participant.  Thus, a Participant who is In Pay Status with
respect to the Retirement Income Benefit is not eligible for
the Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit, and vice versa.


   6.10.  HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS.  A Participant may apply to
the Committee for a preretirement distribution as a result
of severe financial hardship.  The requirements for
constituting a hardship are the same as those in the

<PAGE>   16
survivor benefits under Section 7 shall be payable with respect 
to such Participant; and he may continue to direct the investment 
of his Accounts until they are distributed in accordance with 
Section 6.  Provided that the Participant's participation has not

dies prior to his retirement at his Early, Normal or

benefit equal to 25% of the Participant's deferrals and




                                       12

alternative, payable for the life of the surviving spouse.
For purposes of computing the distributions to be made
pursuant to this Section 7.03(b), if the Participant's
spouse is more than five (5) years younger than the

                            SPLIT DOLLAR AGREEMENT


THIS  Agreement entered into this 7th day of
February, 1991, by and between Whitmire Distribution
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the "Corporation") and Melburn Whitmire (hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Executive").

1. Purpose of Agreement
   --------------------

   WHEREAS, the Executive is insured under Policy Number
   41 209 276 (the "Policy") issued by Equitable Variable Life
   Insurance Company ("Equitable"); and

   WHEREAS, the owner of the Policy (the "Owner") shall be the
   Executive or the person or other entity to whom the Executive
   assigns the Policy pursuant to Section 6; and

   WHEREAS, the Corporation agrees to the payment of premiums
   under the Policy as provided in Section 3; and

   WHEREAS, the Executive has agreed to assign an interest in the
   Policy to the Corporation as collateral security for such
   premium payments, at the time of the first premium payment, on
   a form of agreement approved by Equitable (the "Collateral
   Assignment Agreement"); and

   WHEREAS, the parties desire to have a separate agreement
   outlining their respective interests and obligations in the
   Policy;

   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual
   covenants expressed herein by both parties, the Executive and
   the Corporation bind themselves and their respective
   successors and assigns, and hereby agree as follows:

2. Insurance Policy and Amounts
   ----------------------------

   The Executive is the owner of the aforementioned Policy
   insuring his life. The Executive's initial portion of the
   total life insurance proceeds is $630,000.00 ("Amount of
   Insurance"). This amount is equivalent to three times the
   Executive's annualized base salary as of January 1, 1991
   ("Anniversary Date"), rounded to the next higher $1,000.

   On each subsequent Anniversary Date the Amount of Insurance
   shall be adjusted to equal the amount determined under the
   above formula, based on the Executive's annualized base
   salary.

   If required, the Executive will do everything necessary to
   cause the policy and increases thereon to be issued by
   Equitable, including completion of applications, submission to
   medical examinations/laboratory tests and authorization to
   release medical information to Equitable.

<PAGE>   24

3. Payment of Premiums
   -------------------

   The Corporation shall pay the premiums on the Policy through
   the earlier of the Program Maturity Date and the termination
   of this Agreement under Section 7. The Program Maturity Date
   shall be the first day of the month next following the
   Executive's actual retirement from the Corporation.

   The Corporation may increase or decrease the scheduled premium
   for any year after the first year.  Each premium for the
   Policy following execution of this Agreement will be remitted
   by the Corporation to Equitable within 31 days following the
   Anniversary Date.

4. Policy Beneficiary Designation
   ------------------------------

   The right to designate and change the beneficiary of the
   Policy and to elect an optional mode of settlement is reserved
   to the person who would be the Owner of the Policy in the
   absence of the Collateral Assignment Agreement. Such Policy
   Owner shall have the right to designate and change the
   beneficiaries and contingent beneficiaries and to elect an
   optional mode of settlement subject to the interest of the
   Corporation as Assignee under the Collateral Assignment
   Agreement, and the Corporation will make the Policy available
   to the Owner, if required for endorsement of a change of
   beneficiary.

5. Payment of Policy Proceeds in Event of Death of Executive
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   If the Executive dies while the Policy and this Agreement are
   in force, the proceeds of the Policy will be payable as
   follows:

   (a) Part shall be payable to the beneficiary under the Policy
       equal to the Amount of Insurance determined under the
       formula in Section 2 of this Agreement.

   (b) The entire outstanding balance of the proceeds in excess
       of the part payable under (a) above shall be payable to
       the Corporation which amount is designed to reimburse the
       Corporation for the aggregate amount of the premium
       payments made by the Corporation pursuant to this
       Agreement, less any outstanding Policy loans received by
       the Corporation prior to the Executive's death.

6. Corporation's Exercise of Rights as Assignee
   --------------------------------------------

   The Corporation, during the lifetime of the Executive and
   prior to the termination of this Agreement, may exercise any
   of its rights as Assignee of the policy without the consent of
   the Executive. If a Policy loan is made by the Corporation,
   it shall be responsible for the interest thereon and shall pay
   such interest as it becomes due.


                                      2

<PAGE>   25

     Subject to Corporation's rights as Assignee, the Owner retains
     all rights as Owner of the Policy, including the right of
     assignment.   The Owner agrees not to withdraw, surrender,
     borrow against, or pledge as security for a loan any portion
     of the Policy cash value while this Agreement is in effect.

7.   Termination of Agreement
     ------------------------

     This Agreement shall terminate if any of the following takes
     place:

     (a)  Termination of the Executive's employment with the
          Corporation prior to the Executive's becoming eligible
          for disability benefits under the Whitmire Distribution
          Corporation  Long-Term  Disability  Plan  or  prior  to
          retirement;

     (b)  The Program Maturity Date;

     (c)  Demotion of the Executive to a position which is not part
          of the group of Executives eligible to participate in the
          Corporation's  Executive  Life  Insurance  Program  as
          determined by the Corporation;

     (d)  The bankruptcy of the Corporation;

     (e)  The failure of the Corporation to pay the premium under
          Section 3 of this Agreement;

     (f)  Payment to the Corporation by the Executive of the
          aggregate amount of the premiums paid by the Corporation
          pursuant to this Agreement; or

     (g)  Termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.

     In the event of termination of this Agreement, the aggregate
     of the premiums paid by the Corporation pursuant to this
     Agreement, less any outstanding Policy loans received by the
     Corporation prior to such termination (or, if less, the net
     cash value in the Policy), shall become due and payable to the
     Corporation.    Upon  recovery  of  such  amount  from  the
     Executive's interest in the Policy, from prior borrowings from
     the Policy, or whatever other source, the Corporation shall
     execute a release of the Collateral Assignment Agreement and
     deliver such release and the Policy to the Owner.  In no event
     shall an Executive be personally liable to the Corporation for
     any amounts due the Corporation pursuant to this paragraph 7.

8.   Insurer Not A Party
     -------------------

     Equitable shall not be deemed to be a party to this Agreement
     for any purpose nor shall it be deemed in any way responsible
     for its validity.  Equitable shall not be obligated to inquire
     as to the distribution or application of any monies payable or
     paid by it under the Policy, and payments or other performance

                                      3

<PAGE>   26

     of its contract obligations in accordance with the terms of
     the Policy shall fully discharge Equitable from any and all
     liability under the Policy.

9.   Amendment and Assignment of Agreement
     -------------------------------------

     (a)  This Agreement shall not be modified or amended except in
          writing signed by the parties hereto.

     (b)  This Agreement is binding upon the heirs, administrators
          or assigns of each party.

     (c)  This Agreement may be terminated by either party by 30
          days' written notice to the other.

     with the laws of the State of California.

                       COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT


A.   For value received, the undersigned (the "Policyowner"), as
     owner of Policy Number 41 209 276 (the "Policy") issued by
     Equitable Variable Life Insurance Company (the "Insurer"),
     hereby assigns, sets over and transfers the Policy to Whitmire
     Distribution Corporation, a corporation organized under the
     laws of the State of Delaware (the "Assignee"), as collateral
     security for those liabilities as may arise under the terms of
     the Split Dollar Agreement between the Policyowner (or its
     assignor) and the Assignee dated as of January 1, 1991 (the
     "Split Dollar Agreement"), subject to the terms and conditions
     in the Policy and to all superior liens, if any, which the
     Insurer has or may have against the Policy.

B.   The  collateral  assignment  being  made  pursuant  to  this
     Agreement is solely for the purpose of assuring the Assignee
     of payment of the liabilities that may become due under the
     terms of the Split Dollar Agreement.

C.   The Policyowner and the Assignee expressly agree, without
     detracting from the generality of the foregoing, that the
     following rights are included in this assignment and pass to
     the Assignee by virtue hereof:

     1.   The sole right to collect the net proceeds of the Policy
          from the Insurer when the Policy becomes a claim by death
          or maturity to the extent of the Assignee's interest as
          defined in the Split Dollar Agreement.

     2.   The sole right to surrender the Policy and receive the
          cash surrender value thereof pursuant to the Policy
          provisions.

     3.   The sole right to obtain one or more loans or advances on
          the Policy,  and to pledge or assign the Policy as
          security for such loans or advances.  In no event shall
          the  total  loans or  advances  exceed the Assignee's
          interest in the policy as set forth in paragraph 7 of the
          Split Dollar Agreement.

     4.   The sole right to assign, sell or convey the Policy,
          subject to the interest of the Assignee.

D.   The Policyowner and the Assignee expressly agree that as long
     as the Policy has not been surrendered, the following rights
     are reserved by the Policyowner and excluded from this
     assignment, and do not pass by virtue hereof:

     1.   The sole right to designate and change the beneficiary.

     2.   The sole right to elect any Optional Mode of Settlement
          permitted by the Policy or permitted by the Insurer.

<PAGE>   28

E. The Assignee covenants and agrees with the Policyowner:

     1.   The amounts which are paid to the Assignee by the Insurer
          pursuant to the terms of the Policy and this Agreement
          and which are remaining after payment of the then
          existing liabilities of the Policyowner under the Split
          Dollar Agreement shall be paid by the Assignee to the
          persons entitled thereto under the Policy had this
          Agreement not been executed.

     2.   That the Assignee will not exercise either the right to
          surrender or withdraw from the Policy or the right to
          obtain Policy loans from the Insurer unless and until
          there has been a default in any of the liabilities under
          the Split Dollar Agreement, failure to pay a premium when
          due or the occurrence of any event under the Split Dollar
          Agreement which calls for the Assignee to recover amounts
          to which the Assignee is entitled under the Policy.  In
          any event, the Assignee shall not exercise any of its
          rights under the Policy until 20 days after the Assignee
          shall  have  mailed,  by  first  class  mail,  to  the
          Policyowner at the address last supplied to the Assignee
          specifically referring to this assignment, notice of
          intention to exercise such right.

     Upon the full payment of all liabilities under the Split
Dollar Agreement by the Policyowner to the Assignee, the Assignee
shall execute an appropriate  instrument of release of this
assignment.

     The Insurer shall be fully protected and discharged from
further obligation by paying in reliance upon the terms of the
Policy and/or the terms of this assignment.  The Insurer shall not
be bound by the terms of the Split Dollar Agreement and may rely on
any written assurance concerning such Agreement provided to the
Insurer by the Policyowner or the Assignee.  Any conflicts between
this assignment and any other agreement, with respect to the rights
of the Assignee under the Policy, shall be resolved in accordance
with the terms of this assignment.

This Agreement entered into this  7th day of February,
1991 by and between Whitmire Distribution Corporation, a Delaware
Corporation   (hereinafter   sometimes   referred   to   as   the
"Corporation") and Melburn Whitmire (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the "Executive").

1.   Purpose of Agreement
     --------------------

     WHEREAS, the Executive is insured under Policy Number
     41 209 277  (the "Policy") issued by Equitable Variable
     Life Insurance Company ("Equitable"); and

     WHEREAS, the owner of the Policy (the "Owner") shall be
     the Corporation; and

     WHEREAS,  the  Corporation agrees  to the payment of
     premiums under the policy as provided in Section 3; and

     WHEREAS,  the  Corporation wishes  to provide to the
     Executive  additional  life  insurance  benefits  by
     permitting the Executive to designate a beneficiary for
     a portion of the life insurance proceeds from the Policy
     as provided in Section 5; and

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to have a separate agreement
     outlining their respective interests and obligations in
     the Policy;

     NOW THEREFORE,  in consideration of the promises and
     mutual covenants expressed herein by both parties, the
     Executive and the Corporation hereby agree as follows:

2.   Insurance Policy and Amounts
     ----------------------------

     The Corporation shall be the sole owner of the Policy,
     except that while in the employ of the Corporation, the
     Executive shall have the right to designate a beneficiary
     or beneficiaries for that portion of the life insurance
     proceeds  from the policy in the initial amount of
     $420,000.00 ("Amount of Insurance").   This amount is
     equivalent to two times the Executive's annualized base
     salary as of January 1, 1991 ("Anniversary Date") rounded
     to the next higher $1,000.

     The Corporation will be the direct beneficiary of the
     balance of the Policy proceeds as of the date of death of
     the Executive,  less any Policy indebtedness to the
     Equitable.

     On  each  subsequent Anniversary Date the Amount  of
     Insurance  shall  be  adjusted  to  equal  the  amount
     determined  under  the  above  formula  based  on  the
     Executive's annualized base salary.


<PAGE>   30

     If required, the Executive will do everything necessary
     to cause the policy and increases therein to be issued by
     Equitable,   including  completion  of  Applications,
     submission to medical examinations/laboratory tests and
     authorization  to  release  medical  information  to
     Equitable.

3.   Payment of Premiums
     -------------------

     The Corporation shall pay the premiums on the Policy
     through the earlier of the Program Maturity Date and the
     termination of this Agreement under Section 6.   The
     Program Maturity Date shall be the first day of the month
     next following the Executive's actual retirement from the
     Corporation.

     The Corporation may increase or decrease the scheduled
     premium for any year after the first year.  Each premium
     for the Policy following execution of this Agreement will
     be remitted by the Corporation to Equitable within 31
     days following the Anniversary Date.

4.   Policy Beneficiary Designation
     ------------------------------

     The right to designate and change the beneficiary of the
     Policy and to elect an optional mode of settlement is
     reserved to the Executive and the Corporation with
     respect to their share of the Policy proceeds as stated
     in  Section  2  of  this Agreement.    The  Executive's
     beneficiary designation is indicated on the Split Dollar
     Policy Endorsement in the attached Appendix A to this
     Agreement.

5.   Payment of Policy Proceeds in event of Death of Executive
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     If the Executive dies while the Policy and this Agreement
     are in force, the proceeds of the Policy will be payable
     as follows:

     (a)  Part  shall  be payable to the Executive's
          beneficiary(ies) under the Policy pursuant to
          the Policy Endorsement in Appendix A equal to
          the Amount of Insurance determined under the
          formula in Section 2 of this Agreement.

     (b)  The entire outstanding balance of the proceeds
          in excess the part payable under the above
          shall be payable to the Corporation.

           INCENTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN





                  EFFECTIVE
                 April 7, 1994




<PAGE>   2
                            CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.
                     INCENTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                                 (the "Plan")

                                      I

                                   PURPOSE
                                   -------
 
   Cardinal Health, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, the
"Company") is willing to provide supplemental retirement benefits
out of its general assets to certain key employees as an incentive
for those individuals to continue their relationship with the
Company and to provide the benefits such individuals could
otherwise earn under the Cardinal Health, Inc. Profit Sharing and
Retirement Savings Plan (the "Qualified Plan") if certain federal
law restrictions did not apply. Only a select group of the
Company's management or highly compensated employees will be
eligible to participate in this program. The Company's goal is to
retain and reward its key employees by helping them to accumulate
benefits for a comfortable retirement.

                                      II

                                 ELIGIBILITY
                                 -----------
                  
   Selection of the Company employees eligible to participate in
the Plan is within the sole discretion of the Chairman of Cardinal
Health, Inc. Only high income or key management employees are
eligible for selection by the Chairman. If you fall into one of
these groups and are chosen by the Chairman to participate in the
Plan, you will sign an Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement
which details the requirements you must satisfy to be eligible to
receive this supplemental retirement benefit from the Company. The
Chairman will review and determine his selections each year. Thus,
selection in one year does not automatically confer a right to
participate in succeeding years.

                                     III

                INCENTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCUMULATIONS
                ---------------------------------------------

   The benefits provided to participants under their Incentive
Deferred Compensation Agreements are paid from the Company's
general assets. The program is, therefore, considered to be an
"unfunded" arrangement as amounts are not set aside or held by the
Company in a trust, escrow, or similar account or fiduciary
relationship on your behalf. Each participant's rights to benefits
under the Plan are equivalent to the rights of any unsecured
general creditor of the Company. However, the Company may open
accounts with one or more investment companies selected by the
Chairman, in his discretion, including from among those used as


                                     -1-




<PAGE>   3
investment options under the Qualified Plan, and may invest funds
subject to this Plan in these mutual funds. Each participant may
be permitted to direct how the portion of the Company's funds
allocable to him or her is invested from among the available
options, if such investment accounts are established. The Company
currently expects any such options to be similar to those available
under the Qualified Plan, but is not obligated to make these or any
other particular investment options available. All investments
shall at all times continue to be a part of the Company's general
assets for all purposes.


   To measure the amount of the Company's obligations to a
participant in this program, the Company will maintain a
bookkeeping record or account of each participant's
"Accumulations". There are three basic components of each
participant's Accumulations:


      First, the Company may credit to your Accumulations
   each calendar year during which you are selected to
   participate in the Plan an amount equal to 3% of your
   compensation from the Company in excess of the
   compensation limit applicable to the Qualified Plan under
   the Internal Revenue Code (currently $150,000 per year)
   but not more than $250,000. For this purpose, your
   compensation includes salary, commission and bonus
   payments made for the year, but does not include other
   cash or noncash compensation, expense reimbursements or
   other benefits provided by the Company, other than your
   own salary deferrals into this Plan or the Qualified
   Plan. In addition, the Company may make an additional
   profit sharing contribution to the Plan for a year, in
   the Company's discretion, to be credited to your
   Accumulations.   One of the purposes of these
   contributions is to make up the portion of automatic and
   special profit sharing contributions to the Qualified
   Plan that you are losing due to the capping of pay
   eligible for consideration under the Qualified Plan under
   Internal Revenue Code rules. All contributions under
   this provision to your Accumulations, as adjusted for
   earnings or losses (described below), are referred to as
   your "PROFIT SHARING VALUE."


      Second, to encourage each participant to invest in
   his or her own future, you may also elect (within 30 days
   of when you first become eligible to participate in the
   Plan for your initial year of participation or, for
   subsequent years, not later than the December 31 prior to
   each such year) to defer payment of a portion of your
   compensation to be earned during the balance of the
   current or next calendar year, as applicable, as a credit
   to your Accumulations.   This second source of
   Accumulations, adjusted for earnings or losses as
   described below, is known as the "DEFERRAL VALUE." The


                                     -2-




<PAGE>   4
    minimum amount you may defer is 1% and the maximum is 15%
    (of the first $250,000 of your compensation), less the
    amount deferrable through the Qualified Plan. Also, who
    is eligible to participate in the deferral portion of the
    Plan is determined on a year to year basis by the
    Company. If you were a participant one year but are not
    eligible in a succeeding year, you will still be a
    participant, but will be treated as "inactive."


      Third, the Company will also match your deferral at
    the same rate it is generally matching 401(k) deferrals
    under the Qualified Plan for the period in question. Any
    "caps" on the match under the Qualified Plan will also
    apply to this Plan, with the match under this Plan being
    offset by the match to the Qualified Plan to the extent
    duplicative. For example, if the Qualified Plan match
    for the year is 75 cents on the dollar, up to the first
    3% of salary deferrals, and you are eligible to defer 5%
    of the first $150,000 of pay to the Qualified Plan (under
    the special discrimination-testing rules of that plan),
    then only the first 3% of deferrals from the portion of
    your salary above $150,000 but less than $250,000 will be
    matched under this Plan. The amounts credited to your
    Accumulations on a matching basis, adjusted for earnings
    or losses as described below, are referred to as your
    "MATCHING VALUE."


   EARNINGS (OR LOSSES): At least once each calendar year while
you have a credit balance in your Accumulations, the Company will
credit your Accumulations with earnings (or losses), if any, for
the period since the last such crediting and determine the value of
your Accumulations at that time. The earnings (or losses) may
either be credited on the basis of the earnings (or losses)
allocable to your directed portion of the Company investments, if
any, or on the basis of a hypothetical earnings rate, as determined
by the Company in its sole discretion. The Company also reserves
the right to adjust the earnings (or losses) credited to your
Accumulations and to determine the value of your Accumulations as
of any date by adjusting such earnings (or losses) or such fair
market value for the Company's tax and other costs of providing
this Plan.


   These earnings will compensate for the postponement of the
receipt of the Accumulations and give you the benefit of tax-
deferred growth of the accumulating amounts. Under current federal
income tax rules, the amounts credited to your Accumulations,
including earnings, will not be taxable income to you in the year
they are credited to your account. You, or your beneficiaries in
the event of your death, will generally be taxable on these amounts
and the credited earnings only if and when benefits are actually
paid to you. Thus, this program provides the opportunity to defer
income and the payment of income taxes.

                                   BENEFITS
                                   --------


A.  Vesting
    -------

     If you participate in the deferral portion of the Plan,
   your Deferral Value will always be 100% "vested". This means
   you will always be entitled to receive benefits from this
   portion of your Accumulations.


     The portion of your Accumulations derived from the Profit
   Sharing Value and the Matching Value will not be fully vested
   until you complete 5 years of service for the Company. A
   "year of service" for this purpose means a period of 12
   consecutive calendar months during which you were employed by
   the Company and worked at least 1,000 hours. Years of service
   are calculated from the date you were first hired as an
   employee by the Company, and anniversaries of that date. The
   schedule for vesting is as follows:


                        
                                     Vested
         Years of Service          Percentage
         ----------------          ----------

          Less than 2                 None
          2 but less than 3            25%
          3 but less than 4            50%
          4 but less than 5            75%
          5 or more                   100%


     In addition, you also become 100% vested in your
   Accumulations upon your death or if you become permanently
   disabled prior to retirement or other termination of service
   with the Company, or upon a "Change in Control," regardless of
   your years of service. "Change in Control" means: (i) the
   purchase or other acquisition by any person, entity or group
   of persons (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of
   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act"), or any comparable
   successor provisions), directly or indirectly, which results
   in beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
   promulgated under the Act) of such person, entity or group of
   persons equalling 30 percent or more of either the outstanding
   common shares of Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal") or the
   combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of
   Cardinal entitled to vote in the election of directors of
   Cardinal, or (ii) the approval by the shareholders of Cardinal
   of a reogranization, merger, or consolidation, with respect to
   which in each case persons who were shareholders of Cardinal
   immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or
   consolidation do not (solely because of their common shares of
   Cardinal owned immediately prior to such reorganization,
   merger, or consolidation) immediately thereafter, own more
   than 50 percent of the combined voting power entitled to vote


                                     -4-




<PAGE>   6
   in the election of directors of the then-outstanding
   securities of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company,
   or (iii) a liquidation or dissolution of Cardinal, or (iv) the
   sale of all or substantially all of Cardinal's assets.


B.  Forfeiture of Benefits
    ----------------------


     If your employment with the Company terminates for any
   reason other than death, disability, or a Change in Control
   prior to the time you have completed 5 years of service, you
   will forfeit some or all (based on the above schedule) rights
   to receive benefits under the Plan, except that you will still
   be entitled to receive benefits based on your Deferral Value.


C.  Payment of Benefits.
    -------------------


     1. RETIREMENT BENEFITS. You will be eligible to
   receive retirement benefits under the plan upon your
   retirement after attaining age 65 with five years of service.
   Retirement benefits will generally be paid as a monthly
   benefit payable for 60 months. The amount of your benefit
   will equal the amount necessary to amortize your total
   Accumulations over the 60 month period. The amount payable
   each month will either be based on an approximately equal
   amortization of principal plus actual earnings (or less actual
   losses) or an amortization based on an assumed interest rate
   declared by the Company from time to time during the period of
   distribution. You must give the Company at least 30 days
   advance written notice of your intention to retire and receive
   retirement benefits. Actual benefit payments will begin on
   the first day of the second month following your satisfaction
   of all requirements for payment.


     2. DISABILITY BENEFITS. If you become totally disabled
   before satisfying the requirements for retirement benefits,
   you will be eligible to receive payment of the amounts
   credited to your Accumulations as a monthly benefit commencing
   after six months of total disability and payable for 60
   months. The amount of the benefit will be determined in the
   same manner as retirement benefits. For this purpose, "total
   disability" means a physical or mental condition which totally
   and presumably permanently prevents you from engaging in any
   substantially gainful activity. It is up to the Company to
   determine whether you qualify as being totally disabled and
   the Company may require you to submit to periodic medical
   examinations to confirm that you are, and continue to be,
   totally disabled. If your disability ends, your disability
   benefit payments will stop. However, you could continue to
   qualify for benefits under another provision of the Plan.


     3. DEATH BENEFITS. In the event of your death while
   receiving benefit payments under the Plan, the Company will
   pay the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by you any


                                     -5-




<PAGE>   7
remaining payments due under the terms of your Incentive
Deferred Compensation Agreement, using the same method of
distribution in effect to you at the date of your death. In
the event of death prior to beginning to receive benefits
under the Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement, the
Company will pay any vested benefits to your beneficiary or
beneficiaries, beginning as soon as practicable after your
death. In this case, benefits will generally be paid as a
monthly benefit payable for 60 months computed in the same
manner as retirement benefits. The Company will provide you
with the form for designating your beneficiary or
beneficiaries. If you fail to make a beneficiary designation,
or if your designated beneficiary predeceases you or cannot be
located, any death benefits will be paid to your estate.


   4. OTHER TERMINATION OF SERVICE. If your service with
the Company terminates for any reason other than retirement,
death, or total disability, then the vested portion of your
Accumulations will be paid to you as a monthly benefit payable
for 60 months computed in the same manner as retirement
benefits, beginning as soon as administratively practicable
after your employment terminates.


   5. PAYMENT ALTERNATIVES. At the Company's election, or
upon your request, benefits may be paid in a lump sum or over
a shorter or longer period of time than the 60 months
generally called for, as described above. However, no request
by you or your beneficiaries for a different payment method
will be binding on the Company, and any accelerated or
deferred payment of benefits shall be made only in the sole
discretion of the Company. In addition, the Company may alter
the payment method in effect from time to time in its
discretion, for example, in order to avoid the loss of a
deduction under Code Section 162(m). If the payment method is
altered, the amount you or your beneficiaries will receive
will be computed under one of the alternative methods for
determining payment amounts provided for under the normal form
of distribution for your Accumulations, determined by the
Company in its discretion.


   6. CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Change in Control occurs,
and your employment with the Company (or its successor)
terminates within two years after the Change in Control
occurred, then you shall be entitled to receive your
Accumulations in a single lump sum within 30 days of your
termination of employment, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Plan or your Incentive Deferred Compensation
Agreement. Also, following a Change in Control, the Company's
discretion to alter the payment methodology (described in Section 5,
above) is limited to accelerating your benefits; the Company
cannot, after a Change in Control, defer the commencement of
payments or extend the period of distribution beyond the
normal periods described in the preceding sections (1-4).

                           MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
                           ------------------------


A.  No Right to Company Assets.
    --------------------------

      As explained previously, this Incentive Deferred
   Compensation Plan is an unfunded arrangement and the agreement
   you will enter into with the Company does not create a trust
   or any kind of a fiduciary relationship between the Company
   and you, your designated beneficiaries or any other person.
   To the extent you, your designated beneficiaries, or any other
   person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company
   under the Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement, that
   right is no greater than the right of any unsecured general
   creditor of the Company.


B.  Modification or Revocation.
    --------------------------

      Your Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement will
   continue in effect until revoked, terminated, or all benefits
   are paid, even during any period of time when you are an
   "inactive" participant because you are not designated by the
   Company as eligible to accumulate additional benefits.
   However, the Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement and
   this Plan may be amended or revoked at any time, in whole or
   in part, by the Company in its sole discretion. Unless you
   agree otherwise, you will still be entitled to the vested
   benefit, if any, that you have earned through the date of any
   amendment or revocation. Such benefits will be payable at the
   times and in the amounts provided for in the Incentive
   Deferred Compensation Agreement, or the Company may elect to
   accelerate distribution and pay all amounts due immediately.


C.  Rights Preserved.
    -----------------

      Nothing in the Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement
   or this Plan gives any employee the right to continued
   employment by the Company. The relationship between you and
   the Company shall continue to be "at will" and may be
   terminated at any time by the Company or you, with or without
   cause, except as may be specifically set forth in any separate
   written employment agreement between you and the Company.


D.  Controlling Documents.
    ----------------------

      This is merely a summary of the key provisions of the
   Incentive Deferred Compensation Agreement currently in use by
   the Company. In the event of any conflict between the
   provisions of this Plan and the Incentive Deferred
   Compensation Agreement, the agreement shall in all cases
   control.

                            CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.
                  INCENTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT



   This agreement is made effective __________________, 19__,
at Dublin, Ohio, by and between Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio
corporation, and/or one of its affiliated companies (collectively             
the "Company"), and _____________________________, an employee of the
Company ("Participant").



                            Background Information
                            ----------------------

   A. It is the desire of the Company to assist the Participant
in providing for his retirement through the use of a deferred
compensation arrangement, and to encourage the Participant to
continue employment with the Company until retirement age.


   B. The Company is willing to provide such supplemental
retirement benefits to the Participant out of its general assets,
provided he satisfies the requirements of this agreement for such
benefits, as an incentive for the Participant to continue his
employment relationship with the Company.


   C. Participant also desires to defer and postpone a portion
of the compensation to be earned for services to be rendered in the
balance of the current year and in subsequent years of employment,
and from time to time thereafter, and in consideration of the
performance of future services for the Company by the Participant,
the Company is willing to permit the Participant to defer and
postpone a portion of such compensation, on the terms and subject
to the conditions of this agreement.



                  AGREEMENT
                  ---------

   The Company and the Participant acknowledge the accuracy of
the foregoing background information and agree as follows:


               ARTICLE I - EMPLOYMENT
               ----------------------

   Section 1.1 EMPLOYMENT.  The Company agrees to employ the
Participant and the Participant agrees to serve the Company in such
capacity as the Company may designate from time to time, and on
such terms and conditions as the Company in its sole discretion may
request, until terminated by either party, or on such terms as may
be set forth in a separate written employment agreement between the
parties, if any.   During the term of his employment, the
Participant shall devote all of his time, attention, skill, and
efforts to the performance of his duties for the Company.


<PAGE>   10
   Section 1.2 COMPENSATION. The Company shall pay the Participant
during the term of his employment hereunder such salary and such
other compensation as may be specifically provided for under any
written employment agreement between the parties, or, if none, as
the Company may from time to time determine. As additional
incentive compensation and supplemental retirement income, the
Company shall also pay the benefits provided in Article III, below,
to the Participant provided he satisfies all the requirements and
conditions set forth in this agreement to be entitled to such
benefits.


   Section 1.3 RIGHTS PRESERVED. Nothing in this agreement shall be
construed to confer upon the Participant the right to continue in
the employment of the Company, or to require the Company to
continue the employment of the Participant. The employment
relationship between the Company and the Participant shall be "at
will" and may be terminated at any time by the Company or the
Participant with or without cause, except as may otherwise be
specifically provided in any written employment agreement between
the parties.


        ARTICLE II - DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCUMULATIONS
        ------------------------------------------------

   Section 2.1 PROFIT SHARING VALUE.   The Company may, in its discretion,
credit to the Participant's Accumulations (as hereinafter defined) each
calendar year an amount equal to 3% of the Participant's Compensation from the
Company in excess of the dollar limitation in effect for the year under Section
401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), but
not more than $250,000. For this purpose, "Compensation" includes only salary,
commission, and bonus payments made to the Participant for personal services
rendered to or for the Company during the year, or contributed to this Plan
under Section 2.2 or to the Cardinal Health, Inc. Profit Sharing and Retirement
Savings Plan (the "Qualified Plan") on behalf of the Participant pursuant to a
salary deferral election, and does not include other cash or noncash
compensation, expense reimbursements, or fringe benefits provided to the
Participant. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary
contribution for a year to the Participant's Accumulations, as determined by
the Company in its discretion. All contributions to the Participant's
Accumulations under this Section 2.1, as adjusted for real or hypothetical
earnings or losses as set forth in Section 2.3 below, shall be referred to as
the "Profit Sharing Value."


   Section 2.2 DEFERRAL AND MATCHING VALUES. Within 30 days of the
effective date of this agreement, and not later than any subsequent
December 31 of each year throughout the term of this agreement, the
Participant and the Company may, by mutual written agreement,
provide for deferred and postponed payment of a percentage of the



                   -2-


<PAGE>   11
Participant's Compensation which otherwise would be paid during the
balance of the initial or next calendar year, as applicable, of
employment for services to be rendered in that year. Whether the
Participant is eligible to elect such a deferral during any
calendar year is determined by the Company, in its discretion, and
the eligibility of the Participant during one year does not affect
eligibility in subsequent years. The Participant shall continue as
a participant during any ineligible years, but shall be treated as
inactive. The minimum amount which may be deferred by the
Participant during an active year is 1% of Compensation (up to
$250,000 per year) and the maximum amount which may be so deferred
is 15% of Compensation (up to $250,000 per year), less the amount
deferable through the Qualified Plan. The Company will credit the
deferred compensation amount agreed to for the next calendar year
to the Participant's Accumulations from time to time as the
deferred amounts otherwise would have been earned by the
Participant. Amounts credited to the Participant's Accumulations
due to such voluntary deferral elections, as adjusted for real or
hypothetical earnings or losses as set forth in Section 2.3 below, shall
be referred to as the "Deferral Value." In addition, the Company
will credit a matching amount to the Participant's Accumulations
equal to the same rate of match applicable to salary deferrals
under the Qualified Plan for the year, but only with respect to the
portion of a Participant's Compensation deferrals that would be
eligible to be matched under the Qualified Plan if the Participant
were permitted to make such deferrals to that plan under the Code.
The Company's matching amounts credited to the Participant's
Accumulations, as adjusted for real or hypothetical earnings or
losses as set forth in Section 2.3 below, shall be referred to as the
"Matching Value."


   Section 2.3 RECORD OF ACCUMULATIONS. Solely for the purpose of
measuring the amount of the Company's obligations to the
Participant or his beneficiaries under this agreement, the Company
will maintain a separate bookkeeping record of the Profit Sharing
Value, the Deferral Value, and the Matching Value (jointly, the
Participant's "Accumulations"). The Company, in its discretion,
may either credit a hypothetical earnings rate to the Participant's
balance of Accumulations for the year, or may actually invest an
amount equal to the amount credited to the Participant's
Accumulations from time to time in an account or accounts in its
name with investment media or companies, which investment options
may include some or all of those used for investment purposes under
the Qualified Plan, as determined by the Company in its discretion.
If such separate investments are made, the Participant may be
permitted to direct the investment with such investment companies
of the portion of the Company's accounts allocable to him under
this agreement in the same manner he is permitted to direct the
investment of his account in the Qualified Plan, except that
certain of the investment options, including Company stock, may not



                   -3-


<PAGE>   12
be available options under this agreement. The Company is not
obligated to make these or any other particular investment options
available, however, if investments are in fact made.


    The Company will credit the Participant's Accumulations with
hypothetical or actual earnings or losses at least annually based
on the earnings rate declared by the Company or the performance
results of the Company's account(s) invested pursuant to the
Company's or the Participant's directions, and shall determine the
fair market value of the Participant's Accumulations based on the
bookkeeping record or the fair market value of the portion of the
Company's accounts representing the Participant's Accumulations.
The determination of the earnings, losses or fair market value of
the Participant's Accumulations may be adjusted by the Company to
reflect its payroll, income or other taxes or costs associated with
this agreement, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion.


               ARTICLE III - BENEFITS
               ----------------------

    Section 3.1 ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS - VESTING. The Participant or
his beneficiaries shall be entitled to benefits from the Company as
set forth in this Article III only upon satisfaction of the vesting
requirements of this section. The Participant shall not be fully
vested in and entitled to benefits hereunder until completion of
five years of service for the Company. A "Year of Service" for
vesting purposes means a period of twelve consecutive calendar
months during which the Participant was employed by the Company and
worked at least 1,000 hours, as determined by the Company. Years
of Service shall be calculated from the Participant's hire date and
anniversaries thereof. The Participant shall also become 100%
vested in his Accumulations upon his death or Total Disability
prior to retirement or other termination of service, or upon a
Change in Control, regardless of his years of service for the
Company.


    "Total Disability" under this agreement shall mean a physical
or mental condition which totally and presumably permanently
prevents the Participant from engaging in any substantially gainful
activity. The Company shall determine the existence of a total
disability in its sole discretion and may require the Participant
to submit to periodic medical examinations at the Participant's
expense to confirm the existence and continuation of a total
disability.


    "Change in Control" under this agreement shall mean: (i) the
purchase or other acquisition by any person, entity or group of
persons (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act"), or any comparable
successor provisions), directly or indirectly which results in the



                   -4-


<PAGE>   13
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
under the Act) of such person, entity or group of persons equalling
30 percent or more of either the outstanding common shares of
Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal") or the combined voting power of
the then-outstanding securities of Cardinal entitled to vote in the
election of directors of Cardinal, or (ii) the approval by the
shareholders of Cardinal of a reorganization, merger, or
consolidation, with respect to which in each case persons who were
shareholders of Cardinal immediately prior to such reorganization,
merger or consolidation do not (solely because of their common
shares of Cardinal owned immediately prior to such reorganization,
merger, or consolidation), immediately thereafter, own more than 50
percent of the combined voting power entitled to vote in the
election of directors then-outstanding securities of the
reorganized, merged or consolidated company, or (iii) a liquidation
or dissolution of Cardinal, or (iv) the sale of all or
substantially all of Cardinal's assets.


   If the Participant terminates employment with the Company for
any reason other than death, Total Disability, or a Change in
Control, prior to the date he has completed 5 Years of Service as
defined above, all rights of the Participant, his designated
beneficiaries, executors, administrators, or any other person to
receive benefits under this agreement shall vest in accordance with
the following schedule, with the unvested percentage being
forfeited.


         Years of Service       Percentage Vested
         ----------------       -----------------
          Less than 2               None
          2 but less than 3          25%
          3 but less than 4          50%
          4 but less than 5          75%
          5 or more                 100%


If the Participant is subsequently re-employed by the Company, no
benefits forfeited hereunder shall be reinstated, and the
Participant shall not be given credit for his prior Years of
Service with the Company under any incentive deferred compensation
agreement entered into upon such re-employment unless, and then
only to the extent that, the Company determines otherwise in its
sole discretion.


   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall always be
100% vested in the portion of his Accumulations attributable to his
Deferral Value.


   Section 3.2 RETIREMENT BENEFITS.   Upon retirement after attaining
age 65 with 5 Years of Service as defined in Section 3.1, the Participant
shall be eligible to receive payment of the amounts credited to the



                   -5-


<PAGE>   14
Participant's Accumulations as a monthly benefit payable for 60
months. The amount of this monthly benefit shall equal the amount
necessary to amortize the Participant's Accumulations in
approximately equal monthly installments of principal plus actual
earnings (or less actual losses) during the period of distribution
or, in the Company's sole discretion, the monthly distributions may
instead be computed based on the amortization of the Participant's
Accumulations as a monthly benefit payable for 60 substantially
equal monthly installments computed using an interest rate declared
by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time during such
period of distribution. In the event the retirement benefits
payable pursuant to this agreement are subject to taxation under
the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, Federal Unemployment Tax
Act or any similar present or future tax levied on employers for
payments to employees, the amount payable hereunder shall be
reduced by the Company's share of any such tax payable with respect
to the retirement benefits.  The Participant must provide the
Company at least 30 days advance written notice of his intention to
retire and receive benefits hereunder. Payment of benefits shall
begin on the first day of the second month following satisfaction
of all requirements for a benefit hereunder.


   Section 3.3 DEATH BENEFITS.  In the event of the death of the
Participant while receiving benefit payments under any provision of
this agreement, the Company shall pay the beneficiary or
beneficiaries designated by the Participant the remaining payments
due under this agreement in accordance with the method of
distribution in effect to the Participant at the date of death. In
the event of the death of the Participant prior to the commencement
of the distribution of benefits under this agreement, the Company
shall pay the vested portion of such benefits to the beneficiary or
beneficiaries designated by the Participant, beginning as soon as
practicable after the Participant's death. Such benefits shall be
paid as a monthly payment equal to the amount necessary to amortize
the Participant's Accumulations as a monthly benefit payable for 60
months, computed under one of the alternative methods provided for
retirement benefits under Section 3.2, as selected by the Company in its
sole discretion.


   Section 3.4 DISABILITY BENEFITS.   Upon the Participant's Total
Disability as defined in Section 3.1 prior to satisfying the requirements
for a retirement benefit under Section 3.2, the Participant shall be
eligible to receive payment of the amounts credited to his
Participant's Accumulations as a monthly benefit commencing after
six months of total disability and payable for 60 months. The
amount of this monthly benefit shall equal the amount necessary to
amortize the Participant's Accumulations as a monthly benefit
payable for 60 months, computed under one of the alternative
methods provided for retirement benefits under Section 3.2, as selected by
the Company in its sole discretion.



                   -6-


<PAGE>   15
   Disability shall be considered to have ended and entitlement
to a disability benefit shall cease if the Participant (a) is
reemployed by the Company, or (b) engages in any substantially
gainful activity, except for such employment as is found by the
Company in its sole discretion to be for the primary purpose of
rehabilitation or not incompatible with a finding of total and
permanent disability. If entitlement to a disability benefit
ceases in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the
Participant shall not be prevented from qualifying for a benefit
under another provision of this agreement.


   Section 3.5 TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR OTHER REASONS.   If the
Participant's service for the Company terminates for any reason
other than retirement in accordance with Section 3.2, death, or Total
Disability, then the vested portion of the Participant's
Accumulations shall be paid, beginning as soon as administratively
practicable, to the Participant as a monthly benefit payable for 60
months, computed under one of the alternative methods provided for
retirement benefits under Section 3.2, as selected by the Company in its
sole discretion.


   Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, if
the Participant's employment terminates within two years after a
Change in Control occurred, then the Participant's Accumulations
shall be payable in a single lump sum within 30 days after the
termination of the Participant's employment.


   Section 3.6 PAYMENT ALTERNATIVES. At the Company's election, or
upon request by the Participant or his designated beneficiary
following the Participant's retirement, other termination of
service, disability, or death, the entire vested balance of the
Participant's Accumulations may be payable hereunder at any time in
lump sum or over a shorter or longer period of time than the 60
months generally called for in the sections above, provided,
however, that no such request shall be binding upon the Company and
any accelerated or deferred payment hereunder shall be made only in
the sole discretion of the Company. In addition, the Company may
alter the payment method in effect from time to time in its sole
discretion as necessary or desirable to avoid the loss of a tax
deduction under Code Section 162(m). The amount of monthly payments to be
made over a period of time other than 60 months shall be computed
under one of the methodologies applicable to the payment of
benefits under this agreement in the normal form of distribution,
as determined by the Company in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs, the
Company may under no circumstances and for no reason, including but
not limited to those recited herein, extend the payment period
beyond, or delay the commencement of payments to a date later than,
that otherwise specifically provided for under Sections 3.2-3.5, above.




                   -7-


<PAGE>   16
    +SC3.7 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. The Participant shall designate
one or more beneficiaries on a form to be supplied by the Company
to receive any Accumulations payable in the event of his death.
The Participant may change his beneficiary designation at any time
 (without the consent of any prior beneficiary) by executing a
revised beneficiary designation form and delivering it to the
Company before his death.    In the absence of a beneficiary
designation, or in the event the designated beneficiary predeceases
the Participant or cannot be located, any death benefits provided
under this agreement shall be paid to the Participant's estate.


              ARTICLE IV - MISCELLANEOUS
              --------------------------

    Section 4.1 RIGHT TO ASSETS. Nothing contained in this agreement and
no action taken pursuant to the provisions of this agreement shall
create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a
fiduciary relationship between the Company and the Participant, any
designated beneficiary, or any other person. If the Company elects
to invest any funds in connection with this agreement, all such
investments shall continue for all purposes to be a part of the
general assets of the Company, and no person other than the Company
shall by virtue of the provisions of this agreement have any
interest in such funds. To the extent the Participant, any
designated beneficiary, or any other person acquires a right to
receive payments from the Company under this agreement, such right
shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general
creditor of the Company.


    Section 4.2 ASSIGNMENT AND ALIENATION PROHIBITED.  Neither the
Participant, his surviving spouse, nor other beneficiaries under
this agreement shall have the power or right to transfer, assign,
anticipate, hypothecate, mortgage, commute, modify, or otherwise
encumber, in advance, any of the benefits payable hereunder, nor
shall any of said benefits be subject to seizure for the payment of
any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance owed by the
Participant or his beneficiary, nor be transferable by operation of
law in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise. In the
event the Participant or any beneficiary attempts assignment,
commutation, hypothecation, transfer, or disposal of the benefits
hereunder, the Company's liabilities shall forthwith cease and
terminate.


    Section 4.3 REVOCATION. This agreement shall continue in effect
until revoked or terminated and, specifically shall continue in
effect during any period when the Company, in the exercise of its
discretion, decides that the Participant is not entitled to
participate in any profit sharing, deferral, or matching
contributions to his Accumulations. This agreement may be amended
or revoked at any time or times, in whole or in part, by the
Company in its sole discretion. However, unless the parties agree



                   -8-


<PAGE>   17
otherwise, in the event of a modification or revocation, the
Participant shall be entitled to the vested benefits, if any, that
have accrued through the date of such amendment or revocation.
Such benefits shall be payable at such times and in such amounts as
are provided in this agreement, or the Company may, in its sole
discretion, elect to accelerate distribution and pay all vested
amounts at any time after this agreement terminates.


    Section 4.4 EFFECT ON OTHER COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS. Nothing contained
in this agreement shall affect the right of the Participant to
participate in or be covered by any qualified or non-qualified
pension, profit-sharing, group, bonus, or other supplemental
compensation or fringe benefit plan constituting a part of the
Company's existing or future compensation structure. Should the
amount of the Participant's benefits available under the Qualified
Plan be reduced in any year by reason of the Participant's elective
deferrals under this agreement, the Company may, in its discretion,
increase the Participant's Accumulations hereunder to compensate
for such reduction.


    Section 4.5 INTERPRETATION. The Board of Directors of the Company,
or the Compensation Committee or the Chairman as its designee,
shall have full power and authority to interpret, construe, and
administer this agreement, and the interpretation and construction
thereof and actions thereunder by the Board or its designee,
including any valuation of the Participant's Accumulations or the
amount or recipient of the payments to be made therefrom, shall be
binding and conclusive on all persons for all purposes. No member
of the Board of Directors nor any designee shall be liable to any
person for any action taken or omitted in connection with the
interpretation and administration of this agreement, provided that
the foregoing shall not relieve any person of liability for any
action taken or omitted in bad faith. Whenever under this
agreement monthly benefits may be payable in substantially equal
monthly installments computed using an interest rate declared by
the Company in its sole discretion from time to time during such
period of distribution, the calculation of such monthly benefit
payments shall be made under any method deemed reasonable by the
Company, in its sole discretion.


    Section 4.6 BINDING EFFECT. This agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors, and assigns
and the Participant and his heirs, executors, administrators, and
legal representatives.


    Section 4.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement and its exhibits, if
any, represent and embody the entire agreement and understanding of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings relative to this subject matter.

   Section 4.8 GENDERS AND NUMBERS. Whenever permitted by the context
each pronoun shall include other genders or numbers, and each noun
shall include other numbers.


   Section 4.9 CAPTIONS. The captions at the beginnings of the several
sections of this agreement are not part of the context of this
agreement, but are merely labels to assist in locating those
sections, and shall be ignored in construing this agreement.


   Section 4.10 APPLICABLE LAW. Cardinal Health, Inc. is an Ohio
corporation and has its principal offices in the State of Ohio.
This agreement has been negotiated and executed in the State of
Ohio and the parties hereby agree that the validity, meaning, and
performance of this agreement are to be determined, governed, and
enforced under the laws of the State of Ohio, except that any
applicable conflict or choice of laws principles of Ohio law that
would result in the application of the laws of any other state or
jurisdiction to the validity, meaning, or performance of this
agreement shall not apply.
