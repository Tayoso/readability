PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

        (a)    General Development of Business

           Archer Daniels Midland Company was incorporated in
           Delaware in 1923, successor to the Daniels Linseed
           Co. founded in 1902.

           During the last five years, the Company has
           experienced significant growth, spending
           approximately $3.3 billion for construction of new
           plants, expansions of existing plants and the
           acquisitions of plants and transportation equipment.
           There have been no significant dispositions during
           this period.

        (b)    Financial Information About Industry Segments

           The Company is in one business segment--procuring,
           transporting, storing, processing and merchandising
           agricultural commodities and products.

        (c)    Narrative Description of Business

           (i) Principal products produced and principal markets
               for and methods of distribution of such products

               The Company is engaged in the business of
               procuring, transporting, storing, processing and
               merchandising agricultural commodities and
               products.  It is one of the world's largest
               processors of oilseeds, corn and wheat.  The
               Company also processes rice, milo, oats, barley,
               peanuts and cane sugar.  Other operations include
               transporting, merchandising and storing
               agricultural commodities and products.  These
               operations and processes produce products which
               have primarily two end uses, either food or feed
               ingredients.  Each commodity processed is in
               itself a feed ingredient as are the by-products
               produced during the processing of each commodity.

               Production processes of all commodities are
               capital intensive and similar in nature. These
               processes involve grinding, crushing or milling
               with further value added through extraction,
               refining and fermenting.  Generally, each
               commodity can be processed by any of these
               methods to generate additional value added
               products.  All commodities and related processed
               products share the same network of commodity
               procurement facilities, transportation services
               (including rail, barge, truck and ocean vessels)
               and storage facilities.

            PAGE 3
               The geographic areas, customers and marketing
               methods are basically the same for all
               commodities and their related further processed
               products.  Feed ingredient products and by-
               products are sold to farmers, feed dealers and
               livestock producers, all of which can and will
               purchase products from across the entire
               commodity chain.  Food ingredient products are
               also sold to one basic group of customers, food
               processors.  Any single customer may purchase
               products produced from all commodities and any
               single food or feed product could include
               ingredients produced from all commodities we
               process.

           Oilseed Products

           Soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola,
           peanuts, flaxseed and corn germ are processed to
           provide vegetable oils and meals principally for the
           food and feed industries.  Crude vegetable oil is
           sold as is or is further processed by refining and
           hydrogenating into margarine, shortening, salad oils
           and other food products.  Partially refined oil is
           sold for use in chemicals, paints and other
           industrial products. Lecithin, an emulsifier
           produced in the vegetable oil refining process, is
           marketed as a food and feed ingredient.

           Oilseed meals supply more than one-half of the high
           protein ingredients used in the domestic manufacture
           of commercial livestock and poultry feeds. Soybean
           meal is further processed into soy flour and grits,
           used in both food and industrial products, and into
           value-added soy protein products.  Textured
           vegetable protein (TVP R), a soy protein product
           developed by the Company, is sold primarily to the
           institutional food market and, through others, to
           the food consumer market.  The Company also produces
           a wide range of other edible soy protein products
           including isolated soy protein, soy protein
           concentrate, soy-based milk products, soy flours and
           vegetable patties (Harvest Burgers R).  The Company
           produces and markets a wide range of consumer and
           institutional health foods based on the Company's
           various soy protein products.

           Corn Products

           The Company is engaged in dry milling and wet milling
           corn operations. Products produced for use by the
           food and beverage industry include syrup, starch,
           glucose, dextrose, crystalline dextrose, high
           fructose sweeteners, crystalline fructose and grits.
           Corn gluten feed and distillers grains are produced
           for use as feed ingredients. Ethyl alcohol is
           produced to beverage grade or for industrial use as
           ethanol.  Ethanol is used to increase octane, and as
           an extender and oxygenate in gasoline.  Corn germ, a
           byproduct of the milling process, is further
           processed as an oilseed.

            PAGE 4
ITEM 1. BUSINESS--Continued

           The Company produces by fermentation, from dextrose,
           citric and lactic acids, feed-grade amino acids and
           vitamins, lactates, sorbitol, monosodium glutamate,
           nematodes and food emulsifiers principally for the
           food and feed industries.

           Wheat and Other Milled Products

           Wheat flour is sold primarily to large bakeries,
           durum flour is sold to pasta manufacturers and
           bulgur, a gelatinized wheat food, is sold to both
           the export and the domestic food markets. Masa corn
           flour is sold primarily to specialty food producers
           to be used in the production of tortillas, taco
           shells and tortilla chips.

           The Company mills long, medium and short grain rice
           and mills oats into oat bran and oat flour for
           institutional and consumer food customers.  The
           Company also mills milo to produce industrial flour
           that is used in the manufacturing of wall board for
           the building industry.

           Other Products and Services

           The Company buys, stores and cleans agricultural
           commodities, such as corn, wheat, soybeans, canola,
           milo, sunflower seeds, rice, oats and barley, for
           resale to other processors worldwide.

           The Company produces and distributes formula feeds
           and animal health and nutrition products to the
           livestock, dairy and poultry industries.  Many of
           the feed ingredients and health and nutrition
           products can be, and in many cases are, produced in
           our other commodity processing operations.

           The Company produces bakery products and mixes which
           are sold to the baking industry.

           The Company produces spaghetti, noodles, macaroni,
           and other consumer food products.  The Company also
           produces lettuce, other fresh vegetables and herbs
           in its hydroponic greenhouse.

           Malt products are produced for use by the food and
           beverage industries.

           The Company produces from cane sugar granulated and
           liquid refined sugars principally for the food and
           beverage industries.

           Hickory Point Bank and Trust Co. furnishes public
           banking services, except commercial loans, as well
           as cash management and securities safekeeping
           services for the Company.

           Agrinational Insurance Company and Agrinational Ltd.,
           Vermont and Cayman Island subsidiaries,
           respectively, act as direct insurers and reinsurers
           of a portion of the Company's domestic and foreign
           property and casualty insurance risks.

           Alfred C. Toepfer International (Germany) and
           affiliates, of which the Company has a 50% interest,
           is one of the world's largest, most respected
           trading companies specializing in processed
           agricultural products.  Toepfer has thirty-nine
           sales offices worldwide.  Compagnie Industrielle et
           Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (Luxembourg) and
           affiliates, of which the Company has a 41.5%
           interest, owns European agricultural processing
           plants that are primarily engaged in corn wet
           milling and wheat starch production.

           The Company, through its partnership with Gold Kist,
           Inc. and Alimenta Processing Corporation d/b/a
           Golden Peanut Company, is a major supplier of
           peanuts to both the domestic and export markets.
           These peanuts are used in peanut butter, snacks,
           cereals and many other foods.

           The percentage of net sales and other operating
           income by classes of products and services for the
           last three fiscal years were as follows:
                                       1994    1993   1992

           Methods of Distribution

           Since the Company's customers are principally other
           manufacturers and processors, its products are
           distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or
           storage facilities directly to the customers'
           facilities.  The Company owns a large number of
           trucks and trailers and owns or leases large numbers
           of railroad tank cars and hopper cars to augment
           those provided by the railroads.  The Company uses
           the inland waterway system and functions as a
           contract carrier of commodities for its own
           operations as well as for other companies.

            PAGE 6
Item 1. BUSINESS--continued

           The Company owns, leases or manages under operating
           agreements approximately 1,900 river barges and 25
           line-haul towboats.

          (ii)  Status of new products

                The Company continues to expand its bioproducts.
                The Company is currently producing, from
                dextrose, the feed-grade amino acids lysine and
                threonine, and expects to be producing
                tryptophan during the coming year.  The Company
                has entered the vitamin market with the
                production of riboflavin and biotin, and is
                currently expanding production facilities to
                produce vitamins C and E.  The Company is also
                producing, from dextrose fermentation, citric
                acid, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and lactic
                acid and is scheduled to begin to produce, in
                the next year, the food additive, xanthan gum.

         (iii)  Source and availability of raw materials

                Substantially all of the Company's raw materials
                are agricultural commodities.  In any single
                year, the availability and price of these
                commodities are subject to wide fluctuations
                due to unpredictable factors such as weather,
                plantings, government (domestic and foreign)
                farm programs and policies, changes in global
                demand created by population growth and higher
                standards of living and worldwide production of
                similar and competitive crops.  The Company
                follows a policy of hedging commodity
                transactions, including certain anticipated
                production requirements, to minimize price risk
                due to market fluctuations and risk of crop
                failure.

          (iv)  Patents, trademarks and licenses

                The Company owns several valuable patents,
                trademarks and licenses but does not consider
                its business dependent upon any single or group
                of patents, trademarks and licenses.




        (v)  Extent to which business is seasonal

                Since the Company is so widely diversified in
                global agribusiness markets, there are no
                material seasonal fluctuations in the
                manufacture, sale and distribution of its
                products and services.  There is a degree of
                seasonality in the growing season and
                procurement of the Company's principal raw
                materials, oilseeds, wheat, corn and other
                grains.  However, the actual physical movement
                of the millions of bushels of these crops
                through the Company's storage and processing
                facilities is reasonably constant throughout
                the year.  The worldwide need for food is not
                seasonal and is ever expanding as is the
                world's population.
6
            PAGE 7
Item 1. BUSINESS--Continued

         (vi)         Working capital items

               Price variations and availability of grain at
               harvest often cause wide fluctuations in the
               Company's inventories and short-term borrowings.

        (vii)  Dependence on single customer

               No material part of the Company's business is
               dependent upon a single customer or very few
               customers.

        (viii)            Amount of backlog

               Because of the nature of the Company's business,
               the backlog of orders at year end is not a
               significant indication of the Company's activity
               for the current or upcoming year.

         (ix)  Business subject to renegotiation

               The Company has no business with the government
               that is subject to renegotiation.

          (x)        Competitive conditions

               Markets for the Company's products are highly
               competitive and sensitive to product
               substitution.  No single company competes with
               the Company in all of its markets; however, a
               number of large companies compete in one or more
               markets.  Major competitors in one or more
               markets include, but are not limited to,
               Cargill, Inc., ConAgra, Inc., CPC International,
               Eridania Beghin-Say and Tate & Lyle.

         (xi)  Research and development expenditures

               Practically all of the Company's technical
               efforts and expenditures are concerned with food
               and feed ingredient products. Special efforts
               are being made to find improvements in food
               technology to alleviate the protein malnutrition
               throughout the world, utilizing the three
               largest United States crops-wheat, soybeans and
               corn.

               The need to successfully market new or improved
               food and feed ingredients developed in the
               Company's research laboratories led to the
               concept of technical support.  The Company is
               staffed with technical representatives  who work
               closely with customers and potential customers
               on the development of food and feed products
               which incorporate Company produced ingredients.

Item 1. BUSINESS--Continued

               These technical representatives are an adjunct to
               both the research and sales functions.

               The Company maintains a research laboratory in
               Decatur, Illinois where product and process
               development activities are conducted.  Enzyme
               development and production are an important part
               of these activities. Protein research is
               conducted at facilities in Decatur where meat
               and dairy pilot plants support application
               research. Research to support sales and product
               development for bakery products is done at a
               laboratory in Olathe, Kansas.  Additional
               research activities are conducted at the
               Decatur, Indiana feed research facility and at
               the British Arkady plant in Manchester, England.

               The amount spent during the three years ended
               June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 for such technical
               efforts were approximately $20.1, $14.8, and
               $14.6 million, respectively. In addition, the
               Company maintains separate quality control
               departments which are supervised by research
               personnel.

        (xii)  Material effects of capital expenditures for
               environmental protection

               During 1994, $22 million was spent for equipment,
               facilities and programs for pollution control
               and compliance with the requirements of various
               environmental agencies.

               There have been no material effects upon the
               earnings and competitive position of the Company
               resulting from compliance with federal, state
               and local laws or regulations enacted or adopted
               relating to the protection of the environment.

               The Company expects that expenditures for
               environmental facilities and programs will
               continue at approximately the present rate with
               no unusual amounts anticipated for the next two
               years.

        (xiii)          Number of employees

               The number of persons employed by the Company was
               16,013 at June 30, 1994.

Item 2.   PROPERTIES

       (a) Processing Facilities

       The Company has one hundred sixty-three processing plants
       in the United States of which one hundred fifty-six are
       owned and the balance are leased. The Company also owns
       or has a 50% or greater ownership interest in fifty-four
       foreign processing plants.  The Company's operations are
       such that most products are efficiently processed near
       the source of raw materials.  Consequently, the Company
       has many plants located strategically in grain producing
       areas.  The annual volume processed will vary depending
       upon availability of raw material and demand for the
       finished products.

       The Company operates thirty-five domestic and seven
       foreign oilseed crushing plants with a daily processing
       capacity of approximately 73,000 tons.  The domestic

          PAGE 13
Item 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

       In 1993, the State of Illinois Environmental Protection
       Agency brought administrative enforcement proceedings
       arising out of the Company's failure to obtain permits
       for certain pollution control equipment at certain of
       the Company's processing facilities in Illinois.  The
       Company believes it has meritorious defenses.  While the
       Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the
       sanctions which may be imposed in these matters, in
       management's opinion, they will not, either individually
       or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
       the Company's financial condition or results of
       operations.
       
       The Company is involved in approximately 20
       administrative and judicial proceedings in which it has
       been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP)
       under the federal Superfund law and its state analogs
       for the study and clean-up of sites contaminated by
       material discharged into the environment.  In all of
       these matters, there are numerous PRP's.  Due to various
       factors such as the required level of remediation and
       participation in the clean-up effort by others, the
       Company's future clean-up at these sites cannot be
       reasonably estimated.  However, in management's opinion,
       these proceedings will not, either individually or in
       the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
       Company's financial condition or results of operations.
       
       The Company from time to time, in the ordinary course of
       business, is named as a defendant in various lawsuits.
       In management's opinion, the gross liability from
       litigation, including environmental exposure, with or
       without insurance recoveries is not considered to be
       material to the Company's financial condition or results
       of operations.

EXHIBIT 13--ANNUAL REPORT TO SECURITY HOLDERS
Archer Daniels Midland Company

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF
OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION--JUNE 30, 1994

The Company is in one business segment - procuring,
transporting, storing, processing and merchandising agricultural
commodities.  The availability and price of the raw material
commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to
unpredictable factors such as:  weather; plantings; government
(domestic and foreign) farm programs and policies; changes in
global demand created by population growth and higher standards
of living; and global production of similar and competitive
crops.  Generally, changes in the price of raw material
commodities can be passed through to the price of processed
products.  Ethanol is one of a limited few of the Company's
processed products which must be priced to compete with products
produced from other raw materials.  To minimize price risk due
to market fluctuations and risk of crop failure the Company
follows a policy of hedging commodity transactions, including
certain anticipated production requirements.  Inflation over
time has an impact on commodity prices.  The Company's business
is capital intensive and inflation could impact the cost of
capital investments.

Operations

  Net sales and other operating income for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1994 increased to a record high of $11.4 billion from
$9.8 billion in fiscal 1993 due primarily to an 8% increase in
average selling prices of the Company's products and to a lesser
extent, a 5% increase in volume of products sold. Cost of
products sold increased to $10.2 billion from $8.7 billion in
fiscal 1993 due principally to higher raw material commodity
costs and also the increased volume of products sold.  The
effect of the higher selling prices and volume increases,
partially offset by the higher raw material commodity prices
resulted in gross profit increasing 7% to $1.1 billion.  Gross
profit increased to a lesser extent than net sales and other
operating income due primarily to higher corn prices resulting
from the small corn crop due to the widespread Midwest flooding
and by the low price of imported oil, both of which negatively
impacted ethanol product margins.  The flooding also had a
negative impact on procuring, transporting and merchandising
activities for the year.  We estimate that higher corn costs of
about $100 million could not be passed on to ethanol buyers and
costs of approximately $40 million were incurred due to
transportation and plant operation interruptions.

  Net sales and other operating income for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1993 increased 6% to $9.8 billion from $9.2 billion in
fiscal 1992 due primarily to a 5% increase in volume of products
sold.  Costs of products sold increased to $8.7 billion from
$8.2 billion in 1992 due principally to the increased volume of
products sold with the resulting gross profit for 1993
increasing 2% to $1.1 billion.

  Selling, general and administrative expense increased $46
million to $371 million in 1994 from $325 million in 1993 due
principally to $26 million of expense attributable to recently
acquired operations, a $7 million increase in advertising costs
and other general cost increases in support of increased sales
volumes.  Selling, general and administrative expense in 1993
increased $30 million to $325 million from $295 million in 1992
due principally to $13 million of expense attributable to
recently acquired operations and general cost increases in
support of increased sales volumes.

  The decrease in other income for 1994 resulted primarily from
increased interest expense, due principally to higher average
borrowing levels, and to a lesser extent reduced gains on
marketable securities transactions.  The decrease in other
income in 1993 compared to 1992 resulted primarily from
increased interest expense due to higher borrowing levels.  This
decrease was partially offset by gains on marketable securities
transactions.  Marketable securities transaction gains in 1994
and 1993 were $26 million and $34 million, respectively, and
marketable securities transaction losses were $17 million in
1992.

  The Company's effective tax rate was 34% in 1994, 28% in 1993
and 34% in 1992.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for
1993 was due primarily to a $30 million credit from settlement
of prior years' tax audits with the Internal Revenue Service.
In 1994, the increase in the statutory federal income tax rate
from 34% to 35% resulted in additional income tax accruals and a
non-recurring income tax charge of $14 million.

  Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted FASB Statements
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions" and No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
The cumulative effect of adopting these accounting changes was
to decrease earnings by $35 million, net of tax, for FASB
Statement No. 106 and to increase earnings by $68 million for
FASB Statement No. 109.  The new standards did not have a
material effect on the Company's operating results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  At June 30, 1994, the Company continued to show substantial
liquidity with working capital of $2.8 billion including cash
and marketable securities of $1.3 billion.  Working capital also
includes inventory which has a replacement value in excess of
its LIFO carrying value of approximately $74 million.  The cash
and marketable securities, consisting primarily of United States
government obligations, are available for working capital,
future expansion and stock repurchase plans.  Capital resources
were strengthened as shown by the increase in net worth to $5
billion.  The principal source of capital during the year was
funds generated from operations.  The Company's ratio of long-
term debt to total capital at year end was approximately 27%.
Annual maturities of long-term debt range from $13 million to
$28 million during the next five years except for 1997 when $112
million is due.

  Commercial paper and commercial bank lines of credit are
available to meet seasonal cash requirements.  At June 30, 1994,
the Company had $361 million of short-term bank credit lines.
Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's continue to assign the
highest rating to the Company's commercial paper and to rate its
long-term debt as AA- and Aa2, respectively.  The Company has
access to equity and debt capital through numerous alternatives
available from public and private sources in the domestic and
international markets in addition to the cash flow generated
from operations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

The Company is in one business segment-procuring, transporting,
storing, processing and merchandising agricultural products.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries.  Investments in
affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed
earnings since acquisition.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are carried at cost,
and consist primarily of United States government obligations.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents.  At June 30, 1994 and 1993, the fair value of
the Company's marketable securities, based on quoted market
prices, exceeded the carrying value of these securities by $76
million and $66 million, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories, consisting primarily of merchandisable agricultural
commodities and related value-added products, are carried at
cost, which is not in excess of market prices.  Inventory cost
methods include the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, the first-
in, first-out (FIFO) method and the hedging procedure method.
The hedging procedure method approximates FIFO cost by valuing
inventories, futures contracts and open purchase and sale
contracts at market prices.

The Company follows a policy of hedging commodity transactions,
including certain anticipated production requirements, to
minimize price risk due to market fluctuations and risk of crop
failure.  Gains or losses arising from hedges of anticipated
production requirements are included with the cost of the
commodities when purchased.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  The Company
uses the straight line method in computing depreciation for
financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated
methods for income tax purposes.

Net Sales

The Company follows a policy of recognizing sales at the time of
product shipment.  Net margins from grain merchandised, rather
than the total sales value thereof, are included in net sales in
the consolidated statements of earnings.  Gross sales of the
Company, including the total sales value of grain merchandised,
were $14.1 billion in 1994, $12.1 billion in 1993 and $11.4
billion in 1992, and include export sales of $3.2 billion in
1994, $2.9 billion in 1993 and $2.7 billion in 1992.

Per Share Data

Share and per share information have been adjusted to give
effect to stock dividends in the three years ended June 30,
1994, including the 5% stock dividend declared in July 1994, and
payable in September 1994.  Net earnings per common share is
determined by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  The impact of common stock
equivalents is not material.

</TABLE>
At June 30, 1994, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt
exceeded the carrying value by $197 million, as estimated by
using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based
on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements.
Unamortized original issue discounts on the 7% Debentures and
Zero Coupon Debt issues are being amortized at 15.35% and
13.80%, respectively.  Accelerated amortization of the discounts
for tax purposes has the effect of lowering the actual rate of
interest to be paid over the remaining lives of the issues to
approximately 10.80% and 5.87%, respectively.

The aggregate maturities for long-term debt for the five years
after June 30, 1994 are $24 million, $15 million, $112 million,
$28 million, and $13 million, respectively.

At June 30, 1994 the Company had lines of credit totaling $361
million.


Note 4-Shareholders' Equity

The Company has authorized 800 million shares of common stock
and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, both without par value.
No preferred stock has been issued.  At June 30, 1994 and 1993
the Company had approximately 15.6 million and 9.5 million
common shares, respectively, in treasury.  Treasury stock is
recorded at cost, $354 million at June 30, 1994, as a reduction
of common stock.

Stock option plans provide for the granting of options to
employees to purchase common stock of the Company at market
value on the date of grant.  Options expire five to eight years
after the date of grant.  At June 30, 1994 options for 1,950,686
shares at prices ranging from $11.88 to $27.59 per share were
outstanding of which 535,492 shares were exercisable.  There
were 1,188,408 shares available for future grant at June 30,
1994.

Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $4 million at
June 30, 1994 are included as a component of reinvested
earnings.

</TABLE>
The Company made income tax payments of $250 million, $251
million and $196 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

In the first quarter of 1994, the federal income tax rate
increase resulted in additional income tax accruals and a non-
recurring income tax charge of $14 million, or $.04 per share.

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company settled various
tax matters related to audits of prior tax years by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The settlement resulted in a $30 million
credit, or $.08 per share, to the 1993 provision.

Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The cumulative effect of
restating deferred taxes as of July 1, 1992, was to increase
first quarter of 1993 earnings by $68 million, or $.19 per
share.

            PAGE 10
Note 7-Leases

The Company leases principally transportation equipment under
noncancellable operating leases with total future lease
commitments of $102 million, which range from $6 million to $28
million during each of the next five years, and expire on
various dates through 2026. Rent expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992
was $69 million, $66 million, and $59 million, respectively.

Note 8-Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has noncontributory and trusteed pension plans
covering substantially all employees.  It is the Company's
policy to fund pension costs as required by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act.  At June 30, 1994 the plans had
assets at fair value of $267 million and projected benefit
obligations of $305 million based on a discount rate of 7.5%.
Pension expense is not material.

The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," for
health care and life insurance benefit plans as of July 1, 1992.
The cumulative effect of adopting this statement decreased first
quarter 1993 earnings by $35 million (net of related taxes of
$20 million), or $.10 per share.  This charge represented the
discounted present value of expected future retiree health
benefits attributed to employees' service rendered prior to July
1, 1992.  The accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
(APBO) for the unfunded plans at June 30, 1994, were $79
million, based on a discount rate of 7.5% and an assumed health
care cost trend rate of 11.8% for 1995 gradually decreasing to
5.5% by 2004.  Expense of these plans is not material.  A 1%
increase in the health care cost trend rate assumption would not
have had a material impact on the APBO or expense for the year.

In addition, the Company has savings and investment plans
available to eligible employees with one year of service.
Employees may contribute up to 6% of their salaries, not to
exceed $9,000.  The Company matches these contributions, at
various levels, to a maximum of $6,000.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



Board of Directors and Shareholders
Archer Daniels Midland Company
Decatur, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Archer Daniels Midland Company and subsidiaries as of
June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements
of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Archer Daniels Midland Company and its
subsidiaries at June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes and postretirement benefits in 1993.
