                                  ------


ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

     Item 1 of Form 10-K is omitted in accordance with General Instruction
J(2)(d), Omission of Information by Certain Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries.  A
brief description of the business done by RHI Holdings, Inc. and its
subsidiaries is furnished in lieu thereof:

(a)  Brief Description
     -----------------

     RHI Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), formerly known as Rexnord Holdings
Inc., is primarily a holding company incorporated in Delaware.  It has two
subsidiaries, Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII") and Convac GmbH ("Convac"). 
As used herein, the term "Company" refers to RHI Holdings, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.  The Company is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Fairchild Corporation ("TFC").  The Company also holds a
significant equity interest in Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner"), which is a
leading international distributor to the aerospace industry.

     The Company conducts its operations primarily through a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FII, VSI Corporation ("VSI"), in three business segments: 
Aerospace Fasteners, Industrial Products and Communications Services.  The
Aerospace Fasteners segment designs, manufactures and markets high
performance, specialty fastening systems, primarily for aerospace
applications.  The Industrial Products segment designs, manufactures and
markets tooling and electronic control systems for the plastic injection
molding and die casting industries.  The Communications Services segment
furnishes telecommunications services and equipment to tenants of commercial
office buildings.  For a comparison of the sales of each of the Company's
three business segments for each of the last three fiscal years, see
"Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition".

     Operations are also conducted by Convac, a subsidiary acquired in June
1994, which is a leading designer and manufacturer of wet processing tools,
equipment and systems required for the manufacture of semiconductor chips and
related products and for compact and optical storage disks and flat panel
displays.  Convac's balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 is included with the
Industrial Products segment.

     On December 23, 1993, the Company completed a sale of its 43.9% stock
interest in Rexnord Corporation, a manufacturer of mechanical power
transmission components and related products.

<PAGE>
Fiscal 1994 Developments
- ------------------------

     Aerospace Fasteners Restructuring
     ---------------------------------

     In recent years, the Company has undertaken measures designed to reduce
costs and improve operating efficiencies, increase earnings, and maintain its
market position in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.  These measures have
included closing and consolidating certain of the Aerospace Fasteners
segment's facilities.

     As a result of the sustained soft worldwide demand for aircraft, and the
resulting decline in new order rates and prices for aerospace fasteners, in
Fiscal 1994, the Company has undertaken further restructuring actions to
downsize, reduce costs, reduce cycle times and improve margins.  These
restructuring efforts have included discontinuance of certain aircraft engine
bolt product lines, increased cellularization of manufacturing processes,
relocation of its New Jersey operations to California and re-engineering of
certain manufacturing processes and methods to meet increased customer
quality standards.  In connection with these moves, in Fiscal 1994, the
Company recorded restructuring charges of $18.9 million.  The Company
believes the reduction of the capacity of the Aerospace Fasteners segment,
and the reorganization of its remaining manufacturing operations, will
continue to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs.

     The foregoing measures represent a continuation of actions commenced in
Fiscal 1992 and continued in Fiscal 1993, which included the consolidation of
a major manufacturing facility, the elimination of over 410 manufacturing
personnel and 100 other personnel of the Aerospace Fasteners segment, a wage
and salary freeze and certain other actions to improve manufacturing
efficiencies and streamline operations.

     The Company also continues to examine its manufacturing, selling,
general and administrative costs and expenses and intends to further reduce
such costs and expenses in Fiscal 1995 and, to this end may incur additional
restructuring costs related to the elimination of product lines and further
personnel reductions.

Aerospace Fasteners
- -------------------

     The Company, through its Aerospace Fasteners segment, is a leading
worldwide manufacturer and supplier of fastening systems used in the
construction and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft.  The
Aerospace Fasteners segment accounted for 45.8% of total Company sales for
the year ended June 30, 1994.

<PAGE>
Industrial Products
- -------------------

     The Industrial Products segment operates under the trade name D-M-E
Company ("DME"), and Fairchild Data Corporation ("Data").  DME is a leading
manufacturer and supplier of tooling and electronic control products for the
plastics injection molding industry worldwide.  Data is a supplier of modems
for use in high-speed digitized voice and data communications.  The
Industrial Products segment accounted for 37.5% of total Company sales for
the year ended June 30, 1994.

     In June 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
Convac.  Convac is a leading designer and manufacturer of wet processing
tools, equipment and systems required for the manufacture of semiconductor
chips and related products and for compact and optical storage discs and flat
panel displays.  See Note 3 of the Company's consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Communications Services
- -----------------------

     Fairchild Communications Services Company provides telecommunications
equipment and services to tenants of commercial office buildings, under the
trade name Telecom 2000 Services.  The Company believes it is the largest
provider of comprehensive telecommunications services exclusively to multi-
tenant office buildings in the United States.  Fairchild Communications was
founded as a start-up venture in 1985 and has grown rapidly through
expansions and acquisitions.  Sales have grown from $1.4 million in Fiscal
1986 to $74.2 million in Fiscal 1994.  Approximately $48.0 million of such
increase was attributable to acquisitions (determined on an annualized basis
at the date of acquisition), primarily the acquisition of the
telecommunication assets of Amerisystems.  The Communications Services
segment accounted for 16.7% of total Company sales for the year ended June
30, 1994.

Foreign Operations
- ------------------

     The Company's operations are located primarily in the United States and
Europe.  Inter-area sales are not significant to the total revenue of any
geographic area.  Export sales are made by U.S. subsidiaries and divisions to
customers in non-U.S. countries, whereas foreign sales are made by the
Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries.  For the Company's sales results by
geographic area and export sales, see Note 19 of the Company's consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

Major Customers
- ---------------

     No single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in
any of the Company's business segments for the year ended June 30, 1994.

Backlog of Orders
- -----------------

    Backlog is significant in the Company's Aerospace Fasteners segment due
to long-term production requirements of its customers.  Backlog of unfilled
orders is not material in the Industrial Products segment, where most orders
for products are placed and filled within a few weeks.  Backlog is not
applicable to the Communications Services segment.

     The Company's backlog of orders as of June 30, 1994 in the Aerospace
Fasteners and Industrial Products segments amounted to $113.4 million and
$5.6 million, respectively.  The Company anticipates that approximately 87.8%
of the aggregate backlog at June 30, 1994 will be delivered by June 30, 1995.

Suppliers
- ---------

     The Company does not consider itself to be materially dependent upon any
one supplier, but is dependent upon a wide range of subcontractors, vendors
and suppliers of materials to meet its commitments to its customers.

Research and Patents
- --------------------

     The Company's research and development activities have included: applied
research; development of new products; testing and evaluation of, and
improvements to, existing products; improvements in manufacturing techniques
and processes; development of product innovations designed to meet government
safety and environmental requirements; and development of technical services
for manufacturing and marketing.  The Company's sponsored research and
development expenditures amounted to $3,940,000, $3,262,000 and $4,140,000
for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The Company
owns patents relating to the design and manufacture of certain of its
products and is a licensee of technology covered by the patents of other
companies.  The Company does not believe that any of its business segments
are dependent upon any single patent or upon the rights and licenses it
possesses under any single patent owned by others.

Personnel
- ---------

    As of June 30, 1994, the Company had approximately 3,500 employees. 
Approximately 4% of these employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  The Company believes that its relations with its employees are
good.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     See discussion of Environmental Matter under Item 3 "Legal Proceedings"
below.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
- --------------------

     As of June 30, 1994, the Company owned or leased properties totaling
approximately 1,805,000 square feet, approximately 1,210,000 square feet of
which was owned and 595,000 square feet of which was leased.  The Aerospace
Fasteners segment's properties consisted of approximately 697,000 square
feet, with principal operating facilities of approximately 454,000 square
feet concentrated in southern California.  The Industrial Products segment's
properties consisted of approximately 828,000 square feet, with principal
operating facilities of approximately 393,000 square feet located in Arizona,
Michigan, Pennsylvania and Belgium.

     The Company owns its corporate headquarters at Washington-Dulles
International Airport.

     The Company has several parcels of property which it is attempting to
market, lease and/or develop:  (i) an 88 acre parcel located in Farmingdale,
New York, (ii) a 12 acre parcel located in City of Commerce, California,
(iii) a 6 acre parcel in Temple City, California, and (iv) an 8 acre parcel
in Chatsworth, California.  In addition to the above, certain other
properties of the Company are being marketed.

     On January 17, 1994, the Aerospace Fasteners' Chatsworth, California
manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California
earthquake.  As a result, the Company relocated the Chatsworth manufacturing
operations to its other Southern California facilities.  See Note 15 of the
Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

     The following table sets forth the location of the larger physical
properties used in the continuing operations of the Company, their square
footage, the business segment or groups they serve and their primary use. 
Each of these properties owned or leased by the Company is, in management's
opinion, generally well maintained, is suitable to support the Company's
business and is adequate for the Company's present needs.  All of the
Company's occupied properties are maintained and updated on a regular basis.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- ---------------------------

Government Claims
- -----------------

     In 1989, the Company learned through its own quality assurance
procedures, and voluntarily disclosed to its customers and the Department of
Defense, that certain units of VSI had not performed certain production lot
tests mentioned in the military specifications for some limited product
lines.  The Company does not believe that VSI's level of testing resulted in
shipment of unsafe products or that purchasers were otherwise damaged, and
the government subsequently reduced certain test requirements.  In May 1994,
VSI settled this matter with the government by payment of $330,000.

     Following an investigation by the Inspector General of NASA, the civil
division of the United States Department of Justice alleged improprieties in
years 1982 and 1984 through 1986, in indirect costs rates and labor charging
practices of a former subsidiary of the Company.  The Company entered into
settlement discussions with the Department of Justice to attempt to resolve
these claims and has reached an agreement in principle with the government to
settle this matter for $5,000,000, payable in six equal semi-annual
installments, with interest at 6% per year.  The unpaid balance will likely
be collateralized by certain excess real estate.  If the settlement is not
consummated, the government may initiate suit under the False Claims Act,
seeking treble damages and penalties, and under the Truth in Negotiation Act,
seeking a price reduction on certain contracts and subcontracts.

     The Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer (the "ACO"), based upon
the advice of the United States Defense Contract Audit Agency, has made a
determination that FII did not comply with Cost Accounting Standards in
accounting for (i) the 1985 reversion to FII of certain assets of terminated
defined benefit pension plans, and (ii) pension costs upon the closing of
segments of FII's business.  The ACO has directed FII to prepare a cost
impact proposal relating to such plan terminations and segment closings and,
following receipt of such cost impact proposals, may seek adjustments to
contract prices.  The ACO alleges that substantial amounts will be due if
such adjustments are made.  The Company believes it has properly accounted
for the asset reversions in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
The Company has entered into discussions with the government to attempt to
resolve these pension accounting issues.

Civil Litigation
- ----------------

     Maurice Bidermann Litigation
     ----------------------------

     The Company commenced an action in the United States District for the
Southern District of New York, following the breach by Maurice Bidermann
("Bidermann") of an agreement under which Bidermann was to have paid the
Company an aggregate sum of approximately $22,500,000, of which Bidermann
paid $10,000,000.  Additional installments, of $5,000,000 each, were due from
Bidermann on December 31, 1992, and June 30, 1993, both of which Bidermann
failed to pay.  On July 7, 1993, the United States District Court ordered
Bidermann to pay the Company the full amount of its claim, $12,947,000, plus
interest.  Following receipt of the Court's order, Bidermann filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; however,
subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year, on motion of the Company, the Bankruptcy
Court dismissed Bidermann's Chapter 11 proceedings.  Prior to Bidermann's
filing for protection under Chapter 11, and continuing subsequent to the
Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of those proceedings, the Company attached
substantially all assets of Bidermann.  In addition, the Company holds shares
and warrants of Bidermann Industries, USA, Inc., all of which shares and
warrants Bidermann had originally agreed to purchase from the Company for
$22,500,000.  The collectibility of this judgement, which has been affirmed
by the United States Court of Appeals, will depend in part upon the Company's
ability to realize sufficient amounts from its attachments, and the value of
the shares and warrants held.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The Company and other aerospace fastener and industrial product
manufacturers are subject to stringent Federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of
materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.  To date, such
laws and regulations have not had a material effect on the financial
condition of the Company, although the Company has expended, and can be
expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for investigation of
environmental conditions and installation of environmental control
facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar
matters, particularly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

     In connection with its plans to dispose of certain real estate, the
Company must investigate environmental conditions and may be required to take
certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition.  In
addition, management has identified several areas of potential contamination
at or from other facilities owned, or previously owned, by the Company, that
may require the Company either to take corrective action or to contribute to
a clean-up.  The Company is also a defendant in certain lawsuits and
proceedings seeking to require the Company to pay for investigation or
remediation of environmental matters and has been alleged to be a potentially
responsible party at various "Superfund" sites.  Management of the Company
believes that it has recorded adequate reserves in its financial statements
to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or
make any necessary contributions.  No amounts have been recorded as due from
third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any liability of the
Company, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and
are not disputing such liability.

<PAGE>
Other Matters
- -------------

     The Company is involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental
to its business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  The Company,
either on its own or through its insurance carriers, is contesting these

MANAGEMENT'S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------

     RHI Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), formerly known as Rexnord Holdings
Inc., is essentially a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. 
It has two subsidiaries, Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII") and Convac GmbH
("Convac").  The Company's operations are conducted through Convac and VSI
Corporation ("VSI"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FII.  The Company
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Fairchild Corporation ("TFC").  The
Company also holds a significant equity interest in Banner Aerospace, Inc.
("Banner").

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On December 23, 1993, the Company consummated the sale of its 43.9%
stock interest in Rexnord Corporation ("Rexnord"), consisting of 8,083,248
shares, for $22.50 per share, to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc.  The Company
received $181.9 million in proceeds and realized a pre-tax gain of $129.1
million, net of expenses, in the second quarter of Fiscal 1994.

     During the first quarter of Fiscal 1994, the Company adopted Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting For
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and No. 109, "Accounting For
Income Taxes" and elected to take one-time non-cash charges totaling $16.0
million, of which $8.0 million was for postretirement benefits and $8.0
million for the change in accounting for income taxes.  These charges are
reflected in Fiscal 1994, and represent cumulative effects on prior years of
the accounting changes, net of related tax benefits, including the Company's
43.9% share of Rexnord's accounting changes, net of tax.  For Fiscal 1994,
the effect of the changes on pretax income from continuing operations was not
material.

     On June 10, 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the Common Stock of
Convac GmbH for approximately $4,700,000.  Convac GmbH ("Convac") is a
leading designer and manufacturer of high precision state-of-the-art wet
processing tools, equipment and systems required for the manufacture of
semiconductor chips and related products and for compact and optical storage
discs and liquid crystal displays.  The results of operations will be
reported as part of the Industrial Products segment in the future and were
immaterial in Fiscal 1994.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company currently operates in three principal business segments: 
Aerospace Fasteners, Industrial Products and Communications Services.  Set
forth below is a comparison of the results of the operations of the Company
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 ("Fiscal 1994") and June 30, 1993
("Fiscal 1993").  This comparison relates solely to the continuing portions
of the Company's business.

</TABLE>
FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993

General
- -------

     Overall sales declined by 4.2% for Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993,
primarily caused by price erosion due to excess capacity in the aerospace
fasteners industry, reduced order rates from commercial and military
aerospace customers in the Aerospace Fasteners segment and lower revenues due
to the disruption caused by the earthquake.  Reduced order rates were
principally due to reductions in defense spending and reduced build rates of
commercial airplane original equipment manufacturers, due to conditions in
the airline industry.  The decline in sales at the Aerospace Fasteners
segment was partially offset by significant sales increases at the Industrial
Products and Communication Services segments in the Fiscal 1994 period.  The
Industrial Products segment included sales in the current period by Fairchild
Data Corporation which had been classified as a discontinued operation in the
prior periods.

     Operating income decreased by $17.0 million in Fiscal 1994, compared to
Fiscal 1993.  A restructuring charge of $18.9 million was recorded in Fiscal
1994 to further implement the Aerospace Fasteners segment restructuring plan. 
A $4.0 million charge for earthquake damage and related business interruption
also affected this segment in Fiscal 1994.  Operating income was up in the
Industrial Products and Communications Services business segments for Fiscal
1994, however, in the Aerospace Fasteners segment operating income declined
$16.8 million for Fiscal 1994, compared to the prior year.  Other corporate
income also decreased in Fiscal 1994.  (See discussion below).

Aerospace Fasteners
- -------------------

     Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased 17.7% in Fiscal 1994,
compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the reduced order rates.  Ordering
activity remained at low levels at original equipment manufacturers, and in
the replacement markets.  In addition, customers are rescheduling orders to
take later delivery in line with reduced aircraft build rates.

     The operating loss in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $16.8
million in Fiscal 1994, compared to the Fiscal 1993 period.  During the
Fiscal 1994 period, as a result of the sustained soft worldwide demand for
aircraft, aircraft engines and the resulting decline in new order rates and
prices for aerospace fasteners, the Company has continued to undertake
further restructuring actions to further downsize, reduce costs, reduce cycle
times and improve margins.  These restructuring efforts include
discontinuance of certain aircraft engine bolt and other product lines,
increased cellularization of manufacturing processes, relocation of its New
Jersey operations into California and re-engineering certain manufacturing
processes and methods to meet increased customer quality standards.

     The Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $18.9 million in
Fiscal 1994 to cover the cost of the above mentioned restructuring
activities, including the write down of goodwill and surplus assets related
to certain product lines, severance benefits and the nonrecurring costs
associated with the cellularization and reengineering of manufacturing
processes and methods.  Depending on future demand and prices of aerospace
fasteners, the Company may take further restructuring actions in the future
and may record additional restructuring charges to cover the cost of these
activities.  The Fiscal 1993 period included a restructuring charge of $15.5
million relating to further downsizing fastener operations in Europe and
California, and severance and early retirement benefits for terminated
employees.

     On January 17, 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace
Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern
California earthquake.  As a result, the Company has relocated the Chatsworth
manufacturing operations to its other Southern California facilities.  This
disruption has caused increased costs and reduced revenues in Fiscal 1994 and
will likely negatively affect Fiscal 1995 as well.  While the Company carries
insurance for both business interruption and property damage caused by
earthquakes, the policy has a 5% deductible.  The Company has recorded an
unusual pretax loss in Fiscal 1994 of $4.0 million to cover the currently
estimated net cost of the damages and business interruption caused by the
earthquake.  Included in prepaids and other current assets is an insurance
claim receivable of $5.9 million for recoverability of costs related to
business interruption and property damage.

     Operating income in Fiscal 1994 was also affected by (1) reduced demand
and price erosion; and (2) higher quality control costs resulting from
customers' intensified quality requirements.  A large customer's disapproval
in the third quarter of Fiscal 1993, of the quality system at one of the
Aerospace Fasteners segment's plants negatively affected sales and operating
income in Fiscal 1994.  The disapproval resulted in the plant being
ineligible to receive new orders, delayed shipments due to on-site customer
inspection of finished product, and increased quality costs.  The segment has
implemented a program to comply with the customer's quality requirements and
the plant's quality system was requalified by the customer during the first
quarter of Fiscal 1994.  The quality improvement program requires that the
plant reinspect its inventories and modify certain manufacturing processes
and quality procedures at all major facilities.  This program has resulted in
one time start-up costs and increased recurring quality costs, each of which
negatively affected the Fiscal 1994 operating results, and will likely
negatively affect the future profit margins of this segment.

Industrial Products
- -------------------

     Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1994
compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data Corporation sales
in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 76.5% of the increased sales in this segment. 
The increase in sales in the current period reflects customer response to  
D-M-E Company's ("DME") fast delivery programs, new products, and growth of
the domestic economy.  Domestic demand for tooling for plastics has been
strong while foreign demand has been sluggish in certain countries,
reflecting the economic conditions abroad.  However, expansion into selected
foreign markets is being pursued and appears to have potential.

     Operating income in the Industrial Products segment increased 10.2% in
Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data
Corporation operating income in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 48.9% of the
increase in operating income in this segment.  The improved results in the
current period resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating
margins.  In recent years the Industrial Products segment has implemented
several cost savings steps, including overhead reduction and improved
inventory management programs, which have contributed to the higher operating
margins.  The improvements in inventory management and delivery systems
resulted in faster deliveries, reduction in inventory, and higher inventory
turnover.  In addition, DME has continued to implement improved manufacturing
methods that have reduced cycle times and costs.

Communications Services
- -----------------------

     Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 9.0% in Fiscal
1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from
acquisitions, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office
buildings, and growth at existing sites.

     Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 12.2%
in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to increased sales
resulting from the reasons given above and related economies of scale. 
Operating income as a percent of sales in Fiscal 1994 was slightly higher
than Fiscal 1993.

Other Expenses/Income
- ---------------------

     Corporate Administrative Expense - FII's corporate staff performs work
for several corporate entities including TFC, VSI and the Company.  Corporate
administrative expense incurred by FII is invoiced on a monthly basis and
represents the estimated cost of services performed on behalf of such
companies by FII.  Management believes that the corporate administrative
expense of the Company would be higher if it operated as a separate
independent entity.  Corporate administrative expense increased by 27.1% in
Fiscal 1994, as compared to Fiscal 1993, due to allocating a portion of TFC's
administrative expense to the Company.  This increase was due to increased
TFC staff involvement on behalf of the Company.  TFC expense was not
allocated to the Company in the prior year periods.

     Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income includes royalty income,
rental income, gain on the sale of a trademark and the reversal of excess
reserves no longer deemed necessary.  Other corporate income decreased $2.2
million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the absence
of amortization of over accrued retiree health care expense in Fiscal 1994
and the write down of corporate real estate held for sale.

     Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense decreased 12.3% in Fiscal
1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to lower borrowings in Fiscal
1994 and significantly higher cash and cash equivalents in Fiscal 1994.

     Investment Income - Investment income increased $3.2 million in Fiscal
1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily as a result of gains realized on the
liquidation of investments in Fiscal 1994.  Also included in Fiscal 1994 were
$2.8 million of dividends realized on participating pension annuity
contracts, compared to $.9 million in Fiscal 1993.

     Equity in Earnings of Affiliates - Equity in earnings of affiliates
decreased $15.5 million in Fiscal 1994, primarily due to lower earnings of
Banner and of Rexnord prior to the Company selling its interest in Rexnord. 
Consequently, the current year period includes no earnings for Rexnord
subsequent to the sale date.

     Minority Interest expense includes dividend expense on FII's Series C
Preferred Stock.

     Non-Recurring Income - Non-recurring income in Fiscal 1994 includes the
net pre-tax gain of $129.1 million on the Company's 43.9% stock interest in
Rexnord which was sold to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. for $22.50 per share on
December 23, 1993.

     Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1994, the Company provided an income tax
provision at a rate of 42.0%.  The provision tax rate was higher than the
statutory rate, largely due to the write off and amortization of goodwill,
which is not deductible for tax purposes.

Accounting Changes:

     1)  Postretirement Benefits - Using the immediate recognition method,
the after-tax charge to earnings representing the cumulative effect of the
accounting change was $.5 million.  The unamortized portion of an overstated
liability of $10.4 million for discontinued operations substantially offset
the transition obligation of $10.9 million for active employees and retirees
of continuing operations.  In addition, a $7.5 million charge, net of the
Company's related tax benefit, was recorded for the Company's share of
Rexnord's cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.

     2)  Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company elected the immediate
recognition method and recorded a $7.5 million charge representing the
cumulative effect on prior years.  This charge represents deferred taxes
related primarily to differences between the tax basis and book basis of
fixed assets, prepaid pension expense, and inventory.  In addition, a $.5
million charge was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative
charge resulting from this accounting change.

     Extraordinary items - net included in Fiscal 1993 is an extraordinary
charge of $11.8 million, net of tax, which is 42% of the Rexnord Corporation
extraordinary charge related to premiums paid to repurchase debt and the
write off of deferred loan costs.  In addition, FII recorded a charge of $.8
million, net of tax, for deferred loan fees written off from the portion of
the term loan prepaid.

     Net Earnings - Net earnings increased $61.7 million in Fiscal 1994
compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the $129.1 million pretax gain
realized from the sale of shares of Rexnord, offset by a $17.0 million  drop
in operating income, decreased equity earnings of $15.5 million, a $16.0
million charge, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles, and increased taxes on the higher level of income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    Working capital at June 30, 1994 was $77.5 million higher than at June
30, 1993.  The primary reasons for this increase were an increase in cash of
$51.4 million, resulting from the sale of shares of Rexnord, a decrease in
current debt of $51.2 million, offset partially by a $9.8 million decrease in
prepaids and other current assets, primarily from lower net tax assets as a
result of the adoption of SFAS No. 109, and an increase of $17.3 million in
the income tax payable account reflecting taxes recorded on the sale of
shares of Rexnord.  An increase in accounts receivable of $9.5 million was
substantially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued
expenses and was largely due to the acquisition of Convac in June 1994.

     The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from
operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  As a result of certain
amendments to its Credit Agreement and the issuance of FII's Senior Secured
Notes due 1999, $50 million of VSI's revolving credit facility has been
extended from 1994 to 1997.

     The Company also expects to generate cash from the sale of certain
assets and liquidation of investments.  Net assets held for sale at June 30,
1994 had a book value of $35.1 million and included several parcels of real
estate in California and an 88 acre parcel of real estate located in
Farmingdale, New York, which the Company plans to sell, lease or develop,
subject to the resolution of environmental matters and market conditions. 
Included in long-term investments at June 30, 1994 is a contractual
obligation for the Company to receive $12.9 million from an individual which
has a net carrying amount of $9.3 million.  The obligation in part, may be
satisfied by 7.1% of the outstanding common stock of Bidermann Industries
USA, Inc., a closely held company, held by the Company.  In addition, the
Company has attached substantially all of the individual's property. The
individual filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
on July 7, 1993.    However, subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on a
motion by the Company, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Chapter 11
proceedings.  The Company believes that liquidation of assets held or
attached by the Company will be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of
this investment.  (See Item 8, Note 17 to the Company's consolidate financial
statements.)

     The Company's principal cash requirements include debt service, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, payment of other liabilities and mandatory
redemption of, and payment of dividends on, preferred stock.

     The level of the Company's capital expenditures varies from year to
year, depending upon the timing of capital spending for new production
equipment, periodic plant and facility expansion, as well as cost reduction
and labor efficiency programs.  For Fiscal 1994, capital expenditures
including the cost of acquisitions were $18.1 million.  Capital expenditures
for Fiscal 1993 and Fiscal 1992 were $22.9 million and $35.0 million,
respectively.  The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in Fiscal
1995 will approximate $19.6 million.

     During Fiscal 1994, goodwill was reduced by $7.0 million as a result of
the restructuring charge which included a write down of goodwill related to
certain aerospace fasteners product lines which are in the process of being
discontinued.

     Investments and advances - affiliated companies decreased $62.4 million,
primarily due to the sale of the Company's stock interest in Rexnord in the
second quarter of Fiscal 1994, combined with accounting changes and
restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 1994, at
Rexnord and charges for discontinued operations recorded at Banner in the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994.

     Other liabilities that require the use of cash include post-employment
benefits for retirees, environmental investigation and remediation
obligations, litigation settlements and related costs.

     The Company expects that cash on hand, cash generated from operations,
borrowings and asset sales, and the ability to refinance portions of its
debt, will be adequate to satisfy cash requirements.

     The Company's Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with
certain financial covenants, including achieving cumulative earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA Covenant"), and
maintaining certain coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the
Credit Agreement as of the end of Fiscal 1994.  The Company has negotiated an
amendment to the Credit Agreement (i) to accommodate the unusual loss from
the January 17, 1994 Southern California earthquake, and (ii) to reduce by
$5.0 million the Company's minimum requirement under the EBITDA Covenant for
the duration of the Credit Agreement.  To comply with the minimum EBITDA
Covenant requirements (as amended), the Company's subsidiary, VSI, must earn
for the cumulative total of the trailing four quarters, EBITDA as follows: 
$68.6 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 1995, $70.4 million for the
second quarter of Fiscal 1995, $72.1 million for the third quarter of Fiscal
1995 and $75.0 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1995.  VSI's ability
to meet the minimum requirement under the EBITDA Covenant in Fiscal 1995 is
uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able in the
future to comply with the minimum requirements under the EBITDA Covenant and
other financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  Noncompliance with any
of the financial covenants, without cure, or waiver would constitute an event
of default under the Credit Agreement.  An event of default resulting from a
breach of a financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding
a majority of the loans, in acceleration of the principal and interest
outstanding, and termination of the revolving credit line.  If necessary,
management believes a waiver can be obtained.

     FII may transfer available cash as dividends to RHI if the purpose of
such dividends is to provide TFC with funds necessary to meet its debt
service requirements under specified notes and debentures.  All other
dividends from FII to the Company are subject to certain limitations under
the Credit Agreement.  As of June 30, 1994, FII was unable to provide
dividends to the Company.  The Credit Agreement also restricts FII from
additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities for the payment of any
dividends.

IMPACT OF FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan
- ------------------------------------------------

     On July 1, 1994 the Company implemented SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS No. 114").  SFAS No. 114 is a
change in accounting principle that requires the Company, as a creditor, to
evaluate for impairment (i) the collectibility of the contractual principal
and interest of accounts receivable and notes receivable with terms longer
than one year, and (ii) all loans restructured in a troubled debt
restructuring.  Accordingly, any loan impairment shall be recognized in the
financial statements.  The effect of implementing SFAS No. 114, by the
Company, was not material.

Accounting for Certain Investments and Debt and Equity Securities
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

     On July 1, 1994 the Company adopted SFAS 115 "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS No. 115").  SFAS No. 115
provides new rules on accounting and reporting for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments
in debt securities.  The effect of implementing SFAS No. 115, by the Company,
was not material.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     ------------------------------------------

     Corporate Structure:  RHI Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), formerly known
as Rexnord Holdings Inc., is a holding company incorporated in the State of
Delaware.  It has two subsidiaries, Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII") and
Convac GmbH ("Convac").  The Company's operations are conducted through
Convac and VSI Corporation ("VSI"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
FII.  The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Fairchild Corporation
("TFC").  The Company also holds a significant equity interest in Banner
Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").

     Fiscal Year:  The fiscal year ("Fiscal") of the Company ends June 30. 
All references herein to "1994", "1993", and "1992" mean the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

     Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. 
Investments in companies owned between 20 percent and 50 percent are recorded
at cost, adjusted for equity in undistributed earnings or losses since the
date of acquisition (see Note 7).  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     Statements of Cash Flows:  For purposes of these statements, the Company
considers all temporary investments with original maturity dates of three
months or less as cash equivalents.  Total net cash disbursements made by the
Company for income taxes and interest were as follows:

</TABLE>
     Restricted Cash:  On June 30, 1994, the Company had restricted cash of
$545,000, all of which is maintained as collateral for certain debt
facilities.  Cash investments are in high grade, short-term certificate of
deposits.

     Inventories:  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. 
Inventories from continuing operations are valued as follows:

</TABLE>
     For inventories valued on the LIFO method, the excess of current FIFO
over stated LIFO value was approximately $7,924,000 and $8,981,000 at June
30, 1994 and 1993.  The LIFO decrement was immaterial for Fiscal 1994.

     Properties and Depreciation:  Properties are stated at cost and
depreciated over estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis. 
For Federal income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used. 
No interest costs were capitalized in any of the years presented.  Property,
plant, and equipment consisted of the following:

</TABLE>
     Amortization of Goodwill:  The excess of the cost of purchased
businesses over the fair value of their net assets at acquisition dates
(goodwill) is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.

     Deferred Loan Costs:  Deferred loan costs associated with various debt
issues are being amortized over the terms of the related debt, based on the
amount of debt outstanding, using the effective interest method. 
Amortization expense for these loan costs for Fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$2,948,000, $2,493,000 and $1,653,000, respectively.

     Impairment of Long Lived Assets:  The Company reviews its long lived
assets, including property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangibles and
goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  To determine
recoverability of its long lived assets the Company evaluates the probability
that undiscounted future net cash flows, without interest charges, will be
less than the carrying amount of the assets.

     Despite two consecutive years of operating losses in the Company's
Aerospace Fasteners segment, the Company believes that future net cash flows
from this segment will be sufficient to permit recovery of the segment's long
lived assets, including the remaining goodwill, after a $7,000,000 reduction
of goodwill in Fiscal 1994 relating to certain aerospace product lines which
are in the process of being discontinued.

     Foreign Currency Translation:  All balance sheet accounts of foreign
subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the
accounting period.  Income statement items are translated at average currency
exchange rates.  The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a
separate component of stockholder's equity.  Transaction gains and losses
included in other income were not significant.

     Extraordinary items:  The Company recognized extraordinary gains and
losses, net of write-offs of deferred debt issue costs and debt discounts,
from the early extinguishment of debt resulting from the repurchases of its
debentures on the open market or in negotiated transactions.  Total
repurchases made by the Company were $11,023,000 face value purchased for
$11,387,000 in Fiscal 1994, $559,000 face value purchased for $495,000 in
Fiscal 1993, $3,000,000 face value purchased for $2,629,000 in Fiscal 1992.
The Company recorded extraordinary income (loss), net of taxes, of
$(243,000), $18,000, and $201,000 relating to these repurchases in Fiscal
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     The Company also recognized an extraordinary loss in Fiscal 1993
relating to the recapitalization of Rexnord Corporation ("Rexnord"), in which
the Company held a significant equity ownership (see Note 4).

     Non-recurring Items:  Non-recurring income for Fiscal 1994 consists of
the gain realized from the sale of the Company's equity investment in Rexnord
(see Note 2).

     Research and Development:  Company-sponsored research and development
expenditures are expensed as incurred.

     Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements
have been reclassified to conform with the 1994 presentation.

2.   SALE OF REXNORD CORPORATION
     ---------------------------

     On December 23, 1993, the Company completed a sale of its 43.9% stock
interest in Rexnord to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. ("BTR"), for $22.50 per
share.  The Company received $181,873,000 in gross proceeds and realized for
Fiscal 1994, a $129,082,000 net pre-tax gain on the sale.  In connection with
the sale of its interest in Rexnord, the Company agreed to place shares of
Banner, with a fair market value of $25,000,000, in escrow to secure the
Company's indemnification of BTR against a contingent liability.  Once the
contingent liability is resolved, the escrow will be released.  The financial
statements include the Company's equity earnings from Rexnord, until the date
of the sale.  (See Note 7).

3.   ACQUISITIONS
     ------------

     On June 10, 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the Common Stock of
Convac GmbH for approximately $4,700,000.  Convac GmbH is a leading designer
and manufacturer of high precision state-of-the-art wet processing tools,
equipment and systems required for the manufacture of semiconductor chips and
related products, for compact and optical storage discs and liquid crystal
displays.

     Fairchild Communications Services Company ("Fairchild Communications"),
a partnership whose partners are indirect subsidiaries of the Company, has,
within the last few years, completed the acquisition of several small
companies involved in the building telecommunications business.  In Fiscal
1993, Fairchild Communications acquired all the telecommunication assets of
Office Networks, Inc. for approximately $7,300,000.

     The cost of Fiscal 1992 acquisitions by Fairchild Communications totaled
approximately $4,960,000.  These purchases included:  Bramtel, Inc. purchased
August 1991 for $1,800,000; Hansen Communications purchased September 1991
for $160,000; certain assets of Telshare Associates Limited Partnership
purchased April 1992 for approximately $1,100,000; and the stock of Teletech
Resources Corporation purchased May 1992 for approximately $1,900,000,
subject to certain adjustments.

4.   REXNORD RECAPITALIZATION
     ------------------------

     On July 9, 1992, Rex-PT Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Rexnord Corporation, completed a recapitalization (the "Rexnord
Recapitalization").  The Rexnord Recapitalization included (i) a Public
Offering of $172,500,000 of new Senior Notes due 2002, (ii) an increase in
the amount of borrowing available under its credit agreement, and (iii) an
Initial Public Offering (the "Rexnord IPO") of 9,200,000 shares of Rexnord
Corporation Common Stock $0.01 par value, at $17 per share.  Immediately
prior to the Rexnord IPO, Rexnord Corporation (i) redeemed 4,878,582 shares
of its Series A Preferred Stock and paid $5,093,000 as the redemption price,
and (ii) merged with and into Rex-PT Holdings, Inc., which was the surviving
corporation.  Pursuant to the merger, Rex-PT Holdings,Inc. changed its name
to Rexnord Corporation.

     In conjunction with the Rexnord IPO, the Company exercised an option to
purchase 1,794,530 shares of Rexnord common stock from Zaria Inc. for
approximately $18,600,000, and converted all classes of Rexnord's Preferred
Stock held by the Company into Common Shares of Rexnord at a conversion price
of $22 per share.  Subsequent to the completion of the Rexnord IPO, the
Company owned approximately 44.7% of Rexnord's common stock.  As a result of
the Rexnord Recapitalization, in the first quarter of Fiscal 1993, the
Company recorded an extraordinary charge of $11,804,000, 42.0% (its previous
ownership percentage share) of the Rexnord's extraordinary charge related to
premiums paid to repurchase debt and the writing off of deferred loan costs.

<PAGE>
5.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
     ------------------------------------------------

     During Fiscal 1992, the Company recorded additional write downs on two
previously sold businesses and recognized a $1,399,000 loss on disposal of
discontinued operations, net of a $720,000 tax benefit.

     The Company has decided not to sell Fairchild Data Corporation ("Data")
which previously was included in net assets held for sale.  The Company is
recording the current period's results from Data with the Company's
Industrial Products Segment.  Sales from Data formerly included in net assets
held for sale, and not included in results of operations, were $15,432,000
and $13,624,000 for the twelve months ended June 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  The impact of Data's earnings on the prior year periods was
immaterial.

     Net assets held for sale at June 30, 1994 includes several parcels of
real estate in California and an 88 acre parcel of real estate located in
Farmingdale, New York, which the Company plans to sell, lease or develop,
subject to the resolution of certain environmental matters and market
conditions.

     Net assets held for sale are recorded at estimated net realizable
values, which reflect anticipated sales proceeds and other carrying costs to
be incurred during the holding period.  Interest is not allocated to net
assets held for sale.

6.   INVESTMENTS
     -----------

     Short-term investments consist of corporate and individual obligations,
common stock and equivalents, dividends, interest receivable, and current
maturities of limited partnerships.  Long-term investments consist of limited
partnership interest and certain preferred and common stocks.  Investments
are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The following table presents a

(a)  SC-BI Partners is an investment company partnership which invests in
merger arbitrage and may involve significant risks.  Pursuant to an agreement
among the partners, effective March 31, 1992, the general partner agreed to
liquidate or distribute the assets of the Partnership no later than March 31,
1994, which period could be and was extended for one additional year as a
defined minimum distribution was achieved.  Furthermore, the general partner
has the option to purchase the then remaining interest of the limited partner
(the Company) or the assets of the partnership at a specified purchase price.

(b)  The Company is a judgement creditor of Maurice Bidermann ("Bidermann"). 
On July 7, 1993, Bidermann filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code.  However, subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on a
motion by the Company, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed Bidermann's Chapter 11
proceedings.  The Company believes that between its ownership of shares of
Bidermann Industries USA, Inc., and the value of assets of Bidermann which
have been attached by the Company, that the book value will be recovered. 
The Company has classified this investment as long-term since the timing of
recovery is uncertain.

(c)  Represents a former plant site in Redondo Beach, California, which was
contributed to a joint venture with a developer that has built and partially
leased a retail center.

     On June 30, 1994, the Company owned approximately 47.2% of Banner common
stock, which is included in investments and advances - affiliated companies. 
The Company recorded an equity loss of $5,697,000, $1,380,000 and $671,000 on
its investment in Banner for Fiscal 1994, 1993 and for the four months, March
through June, of Fiscal 1992, respectively.  At the close of trading on
August 26, 1994, Banner stock was quoted at $5.75 per share.  Based on this
price the Company's equity investment in Banner had an approximate market
value of $48,807,000 versus a carrying value of $53,210,000.  The Company
believes this decline in market value is temporary.

     On December 23, 1993 the Company completed the sale of its 43.9% stock
interest in Rexnord.  Prior to the sale of Rexnord, the Company recorded
equity earnings (loss) of $(905,000), $10,828,000 and $4,732,000 on this
investment for Fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  For Fiscal 1994,
the equity loss included an after-tax charge of $2,938,000 for restructuring
of operations, which represented 43.9% of Rexnord's restructuring charge for
the rationalization of manufacturing capacity, the movement of certain
product lines, and other costs related to company-wide employment reductions
and the consolidation of certain manufacturing and administrative functions. 
The net earnings for Fiscal 1994, was decreased by recording the Company's
43.9% share of the cumulative charge which resulted from the adoption of SFAS
No. 106 and SFAS No. 109 at Rexnord.  (See Notes 9 and 10).

     The Company is accounting for its investments in TFC at the lower of
cost or market.  As of June 30, 1994, the investment in TFC common stock had
been written down by $27,674,000 , before tax, to market value.  The carrying
value of investments and advances - affiliated companies consists of the

    The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a credit agreement (the "Credit
Agreement") with a consortium of banks, which provides a revolving credit
facility and two term loans to FII and a revolving credit facility to the
Company (collectively the "Credit Facilities").  The revolving credit
facility provided to the Company generally bears interest at 2.0% over the
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), and matures February 28, 1995.  The
revolving credit facility and Term Loan VII, provided to FII, generally bear
interest at 2.75% over LIBOR and Term Loan VIII, provided to FII, at 3.75%
over LIBOR, respectively.  The commitment fee on the unused portion of the
revolving credit facilities was 0.5% at June 30, 1994.  The Credit Facilities
provided to FII mature on March 31, 1997.  The Credit Facilities are secured
by substantially all of FII's assets.

     The following table summarizes the Credit Facilities under the Credit
Agreement at June 30, 1994:

(2)  Subsequent to June 30, 1994, the revolving credit facility at FII was
     modified by $9,250,000 to $50,250,000.  In addition, the borrowing rate
     increased to generally bear interest at 3.75% over LIBOR and the
     commitment fee increased to 1.0%.
</TABLE>
     At June 30, 1994, the Company had unused bank lines of credit
aggregating $52,561,000 at interest rates approximating the prime rate.  The
Company also has short-term lines of credit relating to foreign operations
aggregating $12,147,000, against which the Company owed $3,592,000 at June
30, 1994.

     At June 30, 1994, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of
$11,839,000, which were supported by the Credit Agreement and other bank
facilities on an unsecured basis.

      On August 5, 1992, FII completed a public offering and issued at par
$125,000,000 of 12.25% Senior Secured Notes (the "Notes") due 1999.  The
Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at FII's option on or after August
1, 1997, at 102% of their aggregate principal amount, and thereafter,
beginning August 1, 1998, at 100% of their aggregate principal amount plus
accrued interest.  The Notes are senior secured obligations of FII ranking
"pari passu" with FII's existing and future senior indebtedness.  The
proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to (i) repay $55,000,000 of
FII's term loans under the Credit Agreement, (ii) repay $50,000,000 of loans
under VSI's revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (which
amounts will be available for future borrowings), including $30,000,000 which
FII paid as a portion of dividends (the "Dividends") to its parent, the
Company, and (iii) as part of the Dividends, repay $20,000,000 of loans under
the Company's revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement.

     As a result of the issuance of the Notes, certain amendments to FII's
bank credit agreement (the "Bank Amendments") became effective on August 5,
1992.  As part of the Bank Amendments, (i) the lenders have extended to 1997
the maturity of $42,000,000 of term loans to FII, (ii) the lenders have
extended from 1994 to 1997 $50,250,000 of loans under VSI's revolving credit
facility, (iii) FII has repaid $55,000,000 of term loans from the proceeds of
the Notes, (iv) VSI has repaid $50,000,000 of loans under its revolving
credit facility, (v) the interest rate on loans outstanding to FII and VSI
under the Credit Agreement has been increased, and (vi) the Credit Agreement
was amended in certain other respects to permit greater operating flexibility
and to permit the payment of the Dividends under specified conditions.

the debt issuances:

     Under the most restrictive covenants of the above indentures, the
Company's consolidated net worth must not be less than $125,000,000.  The
indentures also provide restrictions on the amount of additional borrowings
by the Company.

     The Company's Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with
certain financial covenants, including achieving cumulative earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA Covenant"), and
maintaining certain coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the
Credit Agreement at June 30, 1994.

     The Company has negotiated an amendment to the Credit Agreement (i) to
accommodate the unusual loss from the January 17, 1994 Southern California
earthquake, and (ii) to reduce by $5,000,000 the Company's minimum
requirement under the EBITDA Covenant for the duration of the Credit
Agreement.  To comply with the minimum EBITDA Covenant requirement (as
amended), the Company's subsidiary, VSI, must earn for the cumulative total
of the trailing four quarters, EBITDA as follows:  $68,600,000 for the first
quarter of Fiscal 1995, $70,360,000 for the second quarter of Fiscal 1995,
$72,120,000 for the third quarter of Fiscal 1995, and $75,000,000 for the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 1995.  VSI's ability to meet the minimum requirement
under the EBITDA Covenant in Fiscal 1995 is uncertain, and there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able in the future to comply with the
minimum requirement under the EBITDA Covenant and other financial covenants
under the Credit Agreement.  Noncompliance with any of the financial
covenants, without cure, or waiver would constitute an event of default under
the Credit Agreement.  An event of default resulting from a breach of a
financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of
the loans, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and
a termination of the revolving credit line.  If necessary, management
believes a waiver can be obtained.

     FII may transfer available cash as dividends to the Company at any such
time that TFC is unable to meet its debt service requirements under specified
notes and debentures.  All other dividends from FII to the Company are
subject to certain limitations under the Credit Agreement.  As of June 30,
1994, FII was unable to provide dividends to the Company.  The Credit
Agreement also restricts FII from additional borrowings under the Credit
Facilities for payment of any dividends.

     In addition, the Credit Agreement permits the Company to pay dividends
(i) up to $10,000,000 per year, and (ii) in amounts in excess of $10,000,000
if needed by TFC to service its indebtedness; provided, however, that
dividends pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence are permitted only if and
to the extent TFC does not have cash, cash equivalents or marketable
securities readily available to service its indebtedness and maintain
reasonable working capital.

     For FII's operating subsidiary, VSI, capital expenditures are limited
during the remaining term of the Credit Agreement to the lower of (i) an
annual ceiling of $25,200,000 to $26,500,000 per year, or (ii) 30% of the
prior fiscal year's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.  Capital expenditure reductions can be offset by cash
contributions from the Company.  Capital expenditures can also be increased
if cash proceeds are received from the sale of other property, subject to
approval by the senior lenders under the Credit Agreement.  FII's sale of
property, plant, and equipment is limited during the remaining term of the
Credit Agreement.  VSI is subject to maximum sales for a fair market value of 
$2,000,000 per fiscal year and $5,000,000 over the life of the Credit
Agreement.  FII (other than its subsidiary, VSI) is subject to maximum sales
for a fair market value of $1,000,000 per fiscal year.  However, certain
specified assets can be sold and are not subject to these limitations.

     Annual maturities of long-term debt obligations (exclusive of capital

9.   PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
     ------------------------------------

     Pensions
     --------

     The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all employees.  Employees in foreign subsidiaries may
participate in local pension plans which are in the aggregate insignificant
and are not included in the following disclosures.  The Company's funding
policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by applicable
regulations.

     The tables which follow present net pension expense (income) and a
reconciliation of the funded status of the plans for continuing operations
and certain discontinued operations.

     The following table provides a summary of the components of net periodic
pension expense for the plans:

plan assets are invested in listed stocks and bonds.

     Postretirement Health Care Benefits
     -----------------------------------

     Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS 106"), "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions".  The new standard requires that
the expected cost of postretirement benefits be accrued and charged to
expense during the years the employees render the service.  This is a
significant change from the Company's previous policy of expensing these
costs for active employees when paid.

     The Company elected the immediate recognition method of adoption of SFAS
106.  The unamortized portion of the overstated liability for discontinued
operations was $10,370,000, net of tax, which substantially offset a
$10,904,000, net of tax, charge relating to the transition obligation for
active employees and retirees of continuing operations.  The charge to net
earnings as the cumulative effect of this accounting change was $534,000, net
of tax.  For the Fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the effect of the changes
on pretax income from continuing operations was not material.

     As a result of Rexnord's adoption of SFAS 106, effective July 1, 1993,
the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $7,481,000 to net earnings, which
represented the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative effect of this change
in accounting, net of the related tax benefits from the charge.

     The Company provides health care benefits for most retired employees. 
Postretirement health care expense from continuing operations totaled
$1,948,000, $1,366,000 and $840,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.  The Company has accrued approximately $35,386,000 as
of June 30, 1994, for postretirement health care benefits related to
discontinued operations.  This represents the cumulative discounted value of
the long-term obligation and includes interest expense of $3,011,000,
$4,866,000 and $5,099,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  The components of expense in 1994 are as follows:

</TABLE>
     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using
a discount rate of 8.5%, and a health care cost trend rate of 9.5% and 6.5%
for pre-age-65 and post-age-65 employees, respectively, gradually decreasing
to 4.5% and 5.0%, respectively, in the year 2003 and thereafter.

     Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1% would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30, 1994, by
approximately $2,122,000, and increase the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by approximately $245,000 for Fiscal 1994.

10.  INCOME TAXES
     ------------

     Effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting
for Income Taxes". 

     Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 109, income tax expense was determined using the
deferred method.  Deferred tax expense was based on items of income and
expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and
tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the
difference originated.

     As permitted under SFAS 109, prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.  The Company elected the immediate recognition method and
recorded a $7,476,000 charge representing the prior years' cumulative effect. 
This charge represents deferred taxes that had to be recorded related
primarily to fixed assets, prepaid pension expenses, and inventory basis
differences.

     As a result of Rexnord's adoption of SFAS 109 effective July 1, 1993,
the Company recorded an after-tax charge to net earnings of $523,000, which
represented the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative effect for this
change in accounting.

     The provision for income taxes from continuing operations is summarized
as follows:

     Domestic income taxes, less allowable credits, are provided on the
unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to the
extent that such earnings are intended to be repatriated.  No domestic income
taxes or foreign withholding taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that are considered permanently
invested, or which would be offset by allowable foreign tax credits.  At June
30, 1994, the amount of domestic taxes payable upon distribution of such
earnings was not significant.

     On July 19, 1993, the Internal Revenue Service ("Service") completed an
examination of the Company's Federal income tax returns for fiscal years
ending October 31, 1985 and 1986, and February 28, 1987, and proposed certain
adjustments.  Federal income tax on the adjustments originally proposed by
the Service amounted to $15,600,000, excluding interest.  In February, 1994,
the Service reduced the adjustments and now proposes tax of approximately
$10,700,000, excluding interest.  The most significant adjustments involve
treatment of professional fees incurred by the Company with respect to a
proposed recapitalization of the Company.  The Company has  protested the
adjustments through the appeals process of the Service.  The Company believes
these adjustments will be reduced through the appeals process.

     In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for all
income taxes and interest, and any liability that may arise for prior
periods, as a result of the proposed adjustments, will not have a material
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

11.  MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
     ----------------------------------------------

     The Company is carrying $23,981,000 and $24,015,000 of minority interest
represented by the Series C Preferred Stock of FII in its balance sheet at
June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993, respectively.  The Series C Preferred Stock
has an annual dividend requirement of $4.25 per share through July 21, 1999,
and $7.00 per share thereafter.

     The Company purchased 800 shares of FII's Series C Preferred Stock in
Fiscal 1994.  There were 557,560 and 558,360 shares outstanding at June 30,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

12.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY
     -----------------------------------------

     The Company has classified the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock of FII as a long-term liability.  In January 1989, annual mandatory
redemptions of 165,564 shares began at $45.00 per share plus any dividend in
arrears.  FII has the option of redeeming any or all of its shares, at $45.00
per share.  Due to the merger of FII in August 1989 with the Company, holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled, at their option, but subject to
compliance with certain covenants under FII's Credit Agreement, to redeem
their shares for $27.18 in cash.

     On August 21, 1992, FII closed on an offer to exchange (the "Exchange
Offer") on a one-for-one basis, up to 90% of the outstanding shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock of FII for shares of Series C Cumulative
Preferred Stock of FII.  The Exchange Offer resulted in an increase in FII's
stockholders' equity of $25,126,000 (prior to fees and expenses) due to the
Series C Preferred Stock not being mandatorily redeemable or convertible to
cash.  Approximately 56.8% of the outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock were exchanged for shares of the Series C Preferred Stock. 
The Series C Preferred Stock has an annual dividend requirement of $4.25 per
share through July 21, 1999, and $7.00 per share thereafter.  FII's
requirement to redeem annually shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been
reduced by the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock exchanged for
Series C Preferred Stock, i.e., by 558,360 shares.  Both the Series A
Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.

     The Company purchased 4,000 shares of FII's Series A Preferred Stock in
Fiscal 1994.  The Company did not purchase any shares in Fiscal 1993.  There
were 420,701 and 424,701 shares outstanding at June 30, 1994 and June 30,
1993, respectively.

     Annual maturity redemption requirements for redeemable preferred stock
as of June 30, 1994, are as follows:  $0 for 1995, $4,031,000 for 1996, 
$7,450,000 for 1997, and $7,450,000 for 1998.


13.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     -----------------------------------

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, ("SFAS No. 107")
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires disclosures
of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not
recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that
value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. 
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  In that regard,
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
settlement of the instrument.  SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure
requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not
represent the underlying value of the Company.

     The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

     Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amount reported in the balance
sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates the fair value.

     Investment Securities:  Fair values for equity securities and
investments in affiliates (including investments in affiliates accounted for
under the equity method and not required to be presented under Statement 107)
are based on quoted market prices, where available.  For equity securities
and investments in affiliates not actively traded, fair values are estimated
by using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if there are no
relevant comparables, on pricing models or formulas using current
assumptions.  The fair value of limited partnerships and other investments
are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current
market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the
investment.

     Notes Receivable:  Fair values of notes receivable are estimated by
using discounted cash flow analyses, using a current market rate applicable
to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the investment.

     Short-term Borrowings:  The carrying amounts of the Company's short-term
borrowings approximate their fair values.

     Long-term Borrowings and Notes Payable:  The carrying amounts of
borrowings under the Company's bank Credit Agreement and current maturities
of long-term debt approximate their fair value.  The fair value of the
Company's subordinated debentures and senior notes are based on quoted market
prices, where available.  For subordinated debentures not actively traded,
fair values are estimated by using quoted market prices of comparable
instruments.  The fair value for the Company's other long-term debt is
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

     Minority Interest:  The fair value for preferred stock of a subsidiary
is based on the quoted market price.

     Redeemable Preferred Stock:  The fair value for redeemable preferred
stock of a subsidiary is based on the quoted market price.

     Off-balance-sheet Instruments:  Fair values for the Company's off-
balance-sheet instruments (letters of credit, commitments to extend credit,
and lease guarantees) are based on fees currently charged to enter into
similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements
and the counter parties' credit standing.  The current period's fair value of
the Company's off-balance-sheet instruments is not material.

     The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial
instruments at June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993 are as follows:

14.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
     ---------------------

     During the Fiscal 1994 period, as a result of the sustained soft
worldwide demand for aircraft, aircraft engines and the resulting decline in
new order rates and prices for aerospace fasteners, the Company has continued
to undertake additional restructuring actions to further downsize, reduce
costs, reduce cycle times and improve margins.  These restructuring efforts
include discontinuance of certain aircraft engine bolt and other product
lines, increased cellularization of manufacturing processes, relocation of
its New Jersey operations into California and re-engineering certain
manufacturing processes and methods to meet increased customer quality
standards.

     The Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $18,860,000 in
Fiscal 1994 to cover the cost of the above mentioned restructuring
activities, including the write down of goodwill and surplus assets related
to certain product lines, severance benefits and the nonrecurring costs
associated with the cellularization and reengineering of manufacturing
processes and methods.  Depending on future demand and prices of aerospace
fasteners, the Company may take further restructuring actions in the future
and may record additional restructuring charges for the cost of these
activities.

     The Company recorded restructuring charges of $15,469,000 and $2,500,000
in Fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively, relating to the downsizing of fastener
operations in Europe and California, and severance and early retirement
benefits for terminated employees.

15.  UNUSUAL ITEMS
     -------------

     On January 17, 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace
Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern
California earthquake.  As a result, the Company relocated the Chatsworth
manufacturing operations to its other Southern California facilities.  This
disruption has caused increased costs and reduced revenues in the Fiscal 1994
third and fourth quarters.  While the Company carries insurance for both
business interruption and property damage caused by earthquakes, the policy
has a 5% deductible.  The Company has recorded an unusual pretax loss of
$4,000,000 in Fiscal 1994 in the Aerospace Fasteners segment to cover the
estimated net cost of the damages and related business interruption caused by
the earthquake.  An insurance claim of $5,900,000 has been recorded for
recoverability of costs related to business interruption and property damage. 
In addition, the Company recorded a write down of $2,000,000 relating to this
real estate which is now included in net assets held for sale.

16.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     --------------------------

     Corporate office administrative expense recorded by FII was billed to
the Company on a monthly basis during 1994, 1993 and 1992.  These costs
represent the cost of services incurred on behalf of the Company.  The
Company has reimbursed FII for these services.

     The Company has entered into a tax sharing agreement with TFC whereby
the Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of TFC. 
The Company makes payments to TFC based on the amount of federal income
taxes, if any, it would have paid had it filed a separate federal income tax
return.

     The Aerospace Fasteners segment had sales to Banner Aerospace, Inc. a
47.2% affiliate of the Company, of $5,680,000, $8,750,000 and $10,941,000 in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

17.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
     -----------------------------

     Leases
     ------

     The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under capital
and operating leases.  The following is an analysis of the assets under
capital leases included in property, plant and equipment:

     Rental expense under all leases amounted to $7,193,000, $9,575,000 and
$10,410,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

     In connection with the sale of Metro Credit Corporation, the Company
remained contingently liable as a guarantor of the payment and performance of
obligations of third party lessees under aircraft leases, which call for
aggregate annual base lease payments of approximately $3,454,000 in 1995, and
approximately $11,397,000 over the remaining 5-year guaranty period.  In each
case, the Company has been indemnified by the purchasers and lessors from any
losses related to such guaranties.

Government Claims
- -----------------

     In 1989, the Company learned through its own quality assurance
procedures, and voluntarily disclosed to its customers and the Department of
Defense, that certain units of VSI had not performed certain production lot
tests mentioned in the military specifications for some limited product
lines.  The Company does not believe that VSI's level of testing resulted in
shipment of unsafe products or that purchasers were otherwise damaged, and
the government subsequently reduced certain test requirements.  In May 1994,
VSI settled this matter with the government by payment of $330,000.

     Following an investigation by the Inspector General of NASA, the civil
division of the United States Department of Justice alleged improprieties in
years 1982 and 1984 through 1986, in indirect costs rates and labor charging
practices of a former subsidiary of the Company.  The Company entered into
settlement discussions with the Department of Justice to attempt to resolve
these claims and has reached an agreement in principle with the government to
settle this matter for $5,000,000, payable in six equal semi-annual
installments, with interest at 6% per year.  The unpaid balance will likely
be collateralized by certain excess real estate.  If the settlement is not
consummated, the government may initiate suit under the False Claims Act,
seeking treble damages and penalties, and under the Truth in Negotiation Act,
seeking a price reduction on certain contracts and subcontracts.

     The Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer (the "ACO"), based upon
the advice of the United States Defense Contract Audit Agency, has made a
determination that FII did not comply with Cost Accounting Standards in
accounting for (i) the 1985 reversion to FII of certain assets of terminated
defined benefit pension plans, and (ii) pension costs upon the closing of
segments of FII's business.  The ACO has directed FII to prepare a cost
impact proposal relating to such plan terminations and segment closings and,
following receipt of such cost impact proposals, may seek adjustments to
contract prices.  The ACO alleges that substantial amounts will be due if
such adjustments are made.  The Company believes it has properly accounted
for the asset reversions in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
The Company has entered into discussions with the government to attempt to
resolve these pension accounting issues.

Civil Litigation
- ----------------

     Maurice Bidermann Litigation
     ----------------------------

     The Company commenced an action in the United States District for the
Southern District of New York, following the breach by Maurice Bidermann
("Bidermann") of an agreement under which Bidermann was to have paid the
Company an aggregate sum of approximately $22,500,000, of which Bidermann
paid $10,000,000.  Additional installments, of $5,000,000 each, were due from
Bidermann on December 31, 1992, and June 30, 1993, both of which Bidermann
failed to pay.  On July 7, 1993, the United States District Court ordered
Bidermann to pay the Company the full amount of its claim, $12,947,000, plus
interest.  Following receipt of the Court's order, Bidermann filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; however,
subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year, on motion of the Company, the Bankruptcy
Court dismissed Bidermann's Chapter 11 proceedings.  Prior to Bidermann's
filing for protection under Chapter 11, and continuing subsequent to the
Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of those proceedings, the Company attached
substantially all assets of Bidermann.  In addition, the Company holds shares
and warrants of Bidermann Industries, USA, Inc., all of which shares and
warrants Bidermann had originally agreed to purchase from the Company for
$22,500,000.  The collectibility of this judgement, which has been affirmed
by the United States Court of Appeals, will depend in part upon the Company's
ability to realize sufficient amounts from its attachments, and the value of
the shares and warrants held.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The Company and other aerospace fastener and industrial product
manufacturers are subject to stringent Federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of
materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.  To date, such
laws and regulations have not had a material effect on the financial
condition of the Company, although the Company has expended, and can be
expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for investigation of
environmental conditions and installation of environmental control
facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar
matters, particularly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

     In connection with its plans to dispose of certain real estate, the
Company must investigate environmental conditions and may be required to take
certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition.  In
addition, management has identified several areas of potential contamination
at or from other facilities owned, or previously owned, by the Company, that
may require the Company either to take corrective action or to contribute to
a clean-up.  The Company is also a defendant in certain lawsuits and
proceedings seeking to require the Company to pay for investigation or
remediation of environmental matters and has been alleged to be a potentially
responsible party at various "Superfund" sites.  Management of the Company
believes that it has recorded adequate reserves in its financial statements
to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or
make any necessary contributions.  No amounts have been recorded as due from
third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any liability of the
Company, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and
are not disputing such liability.

Other Matters
- -------------

     The Company is involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental
to its business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  The Company,
either on its own or through its insurance carriers, is contesting these
matters.

     In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal
proceedings, including those discussed above, will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or the future operating results of
the Company.


18.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS
     -----------------

     The Company's operations are conducted in three principal business
segments.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment includes the manufacture of high
performance specialty fasteners and fastening systems.  The Industrial
Products segment is engaged in (i) the manufacture of tooling and injection
control systems for the plastic injection molding and die casting industries,
(ii) the supply of modems for use in high speed digitized voice and data
communications, and (iii) a designer and manufacturer of wet processing
tools, equipment and systems.  The Communications Services segment which
provides telecommunication services to office buildings.  Intersegment sales
are insignificant to the sales of any segment.

     Identifiable assets represent assets that are used in the Company's
operations in each segment at year end.  Corporate assets are principally in
cash, marketable securities, prepaid pension costs, assets held for sale, and
property maintained for general corporate purposes.

     The Company's financial data by business segment is as follows:

     Earnings (loss) from continuing operations includes charges to reflect
the cost of restructuring the Company's Aerospace Fasteners Segment, of
$9,903,000 and $8,957,000 in the second and fourth quarters of Fiscal 1994,
respectively, and $1,500,000, $932,000 and $13,037,000 in the second, third
and fourth quarters of Fiscal 1993, respectively.  The Company recorded an
unusual loss in the third and fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994 of $3,200,000 and
$2,800,000, respectively, to cover the estimated net cost of the damages and
related business interruption caused by an earthquake and the write down of
real estate.

     The second quarter of Fiscal 1994 includes non-recurring income of
$129,094,000, net pre-tax, from the gain on the sale of the Company's 43.9%
stock interest in Rexnord.

     Extraordinary items includes an extraordinary charge of $11,804,000, net
of tax, in the first quarter of Fiscal 1993 relating to the Company's share
of Rexnord's extraordinary charge associated with the Rexnord
Recapitalization.  Other extraordinary items relate to the early
extinguishment of debt by the Company.

     The fiscal 1994 first and second quarter data presented vary from the
amounts previously reported in Form 10-Q due to the Company's decision not to
sell a division which was included in net assets held for sale, and not
included in the results of operations.  Sales from the division were
$4,141,000 and $3,438,000 in the first and second quarters, respectively, of
Fiscal 1994.  Earnings from the division had no material effect during these
periods.

To RHI Holdings, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RHI Holdings,
Inc. (a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of The Fairchild
Corporation and formerly known as Rexnord Holdings Inc.) and subsidiaries as
of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30,
1994, 1993 and 1992.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of RHI Holdings, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and
1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions, and income taxes.

     Re:  Amendment and Waiver for VSI Corporation ("VSI")

Dear Colin,

     Pursuant to the Restated and Amended Credit Agreement dated
as of July 27, 1992, as amended, we request the following
covenant changes for VSI:

     (i)   EBITDA covenant for the quarter ending June 30, 1994
           and each of the remaining quarters to be reduced by
           $5.0 million.

     (ii)  Earthquake related losses (insurance deductible and
           non-reimbursable expenses) up to $4.0 million in
           aggregate to be excluded from EBITDA (whether cash or
           non-cash) for covenant calculation purposes for the
           1994 Third Fiscal Quarter requirement and each of the
           next three quarters; and the same amount to also be
           excluded from the net worth covenant calculation.

     (iii) Fairchild Data Corporation, a direct subsidiary of
           Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII"), is to be
           contributed to VSI and consolidated from July 1,
           1993 for covenant purposes.  It has been included as
           a discontinued operation at FII but will now be
           classified as continuing.  Either the transfer of
           Fairchild Data Corporation will be credited to paid-
           in capital or common stock of VSI will be issued and
           transferred to the Collateral Trustee as security for
           the FII 12-1/4% Senior Secured Notes.  The January 30,
           1994 financial statements for Fairchild Data
           Corporation are enclosed for your information.

     Given the historically volatile earnings of the Aerospace
Fastener Division, we are requesting the $5.0 million adjustment
through the remaining Credit Agreement term.  The detailed
projections for fiscal years 1994-1997 will be furnished next
week.  They show that the EBITDA covenant will be met comfortably
in fiscal years 1996-1997; however, we believe our request is
still reasonble because, despite all current evidence of
improving AFD earnings, they have been volatile.  In our opinion,
this is a conservative approach.

     We agree to pay the approving banks a 1/4% upon the
remaining revolver commitment and term loan outstandings
applicable to each bank when the amendment is approved by the
Requisite Senior Lenders.

     We request that the waiver be effective on or before April
1, 1994 for the third fiscal quarter of 1994.

     Please call me regarding any questions.

Sincerely,




KLS/ss

                               to
              RESTATED AND AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT
                    Dated as of July 27, 1992


          This Consent and Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3")
dated as of December 23, 1993, is entered into among RHI
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("RHI"), the "Senior
Lenders" (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below)
of RHI, Citicorp North America, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Citicorp") and The Bank of Nova Scotia, a Canadian chartered
bank ("Scotiabank") as agents for the Senior Lenders (Citicorp
and Scotiabank being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred
to as the "Agents"), and Citicorp, as administrative agent for
the Senior Lenders (the "Administrative Agent").

          PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. VSI Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, Fairchild Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
RHI, the Senior Lenders, the Agents, and the Administrative Agent
are parties to that certain Restated and Amended Credit Agreement
dated as of July 27, 1992, as amended, (the "Credit Agreement"). 
Capitalized terms used herein without definition are used herein
as defined in the Credit Agreement.  RHI has entered into a
certain Purchase Agreement dated as of December 2, 1993 with The
Fairchild Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("TFC") and BTR
Dunlop Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BTR Dunlop")
(such Purchase Agreement being herein referred to as the
"Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, RHI
has agreed to sell all of the capital stock of Rexnord
Corporation owned by RHI (the "Rexnord Shares") to BTR Dunlop and
to indemnify BTR Dunlop and Rexnord Corporation with respect to
certain environmental liabilities.

          In connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, TFC, RHI and Rexnord Corporation have entered
into a certain Tax Agreement dated as of December 2, 1993 with
BTR Dunlop (the "Tax Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other
things, (a) the Amendment to and Restatement of Tax Agreement
dated May 15, 1992, as amended on August 5, 1993, will be
terminated in its entirety and the Tax Agreement will supersede
the same in its entirety as of the time described therein and (b)
TFC and RHI will become obligated under certain indemnities
specified in the Tax Agreement with respect to certain tax
obligations of Rexnord Corporation.

          In connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, TFC and RHI entered into an Escrow Agreement
dated as of December 2, 1993 with BTR Dunlop and Cahill Gordon &
Reindel, as "Escrow Agent", (the "Escrow Agreement") pursuant to
which, among other things, TFC and RHI are required (a) to
deposit, on the date the transactions described in the Purchase
Agreement close, into the escrow established pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, for the benefit of BTR Dunlop, shares of common
stock of Aerospace having a market price of $25,000,000, as
calculated pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, as of the date of
such deposit and (b) to make or receive supplemental deposits or
withdrawals thereafter of cash and/or common stock of Aerospace
into such escrow under certain circumstances, such deposits to be
held by the Escrow Agent until the obligations of TFC and RHI
expire with respect to the indemnities for federal and state
taxes described in the Tax Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
In connection with the establishment of such escrow arrangement,
RHI has requested that its Requisite Senior Lenders consent to
the release of certain of the stock of Aerospace pledged to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the Special Increase II Pledge
Agreement in an amount sufficient to fund the escrow arrangement
on the date upon which the transactions described in the Purchase
Agreement are consummated.

         It is contemplated that the transactions described in
the Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale of the Rexnord
Shares by RHI to BTR Dunlop will occur on the second Business Day
following the date on which all applicable waiting periods under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and under the law relating to filings with the German
Federal Cartel office referenced in the Purchase Agreement, shall
expire or be terminated.

          It is further contemplated that the proceeds of the
sale of the Rexnord Shares by RHI to BTR Dunlop under the
Purchase Agreement will be used as follows:


     (i)  a portion thereof to repurchase or derease certain of
     RHI's Subordinated Indebtedness (the "Subordinated Debt
     Repayment");

     (ii) a portion thereof to make dividends, distributions or
     other advances to TFC to the extent permitted under the
     terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement;

     (iii) approximately $5,000,000 thereof to repay the
     Rexnord/Holdings Mortgage Indebtedness; and

     (iv)  a portion thereof to repay the obligations of RHI
     under Facility A in an amount sufficient to permanently
     reduce the Facility Outstandings under Facility A to an
     amount less than or equal to the "Facility Commitments" with
     respect to "Facility A" (as each such term is hereinafter
     defined in Section 1 of this Amendment No. 3).

          Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, RHI
and its Senior Lenders have agreed to further amend the Credit
Agreement as hereinafter set forth and to consent to the
transactions described in Section 2 hereof.
