Item 1.    Business

           General Development of Business

           Skyline Corporation was originally incorporated in Indiana in
           1959, as successor to a business founded in 1951.  Skyline
           Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (the "Company")
           design, produce and distribute manufactured housing (mobile
           homes) and recreational vehicles (travel trailers including park
           models and fifth wheels).

           The Company, which is one of the largest manufacturers of
           manufactured homes in the United States, produced 19,467
           manufactured homes in fiscal year 1994.

           The Company's manufactured homes are marketed under a number of
           trademarks.  They are available in lengths ranging from 36' to
           80' and in single wide widths from 12' to 18' and double wide
           widths of 20', 24', 26' and 28'.

           The Company's recreational vehicles are sold under the "Aljo",
           "Aljo Deluxe", "Aljo Alliance", "Layton", "Layton Deluxe",
           "Layton Celebrity", "MountainView", "Outland", "Nomad", "Nomad
           Deluxe" and "Nomad Century" trademarks for travel trailers and
           fifth wheels and the "WeekEnder" trademark for truck campers.

           In fiscal year 1994 manufactured homes represented 76% of total
           sales, while recreational vehicles accounted for the remaining
           24%.  In the prior year the sales dollars were 74% manufactured
           homes and 26% recreational vehicles.  Additional financial data
           relating to these industry segments is included in Note 5,
           Industry Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated
           Financial Statements included in this document under Item 8.

           Narrative Description of Business

           Principal Markets

           The principal markets for manufactured homes are the suburban and
           rural areas of the continental United States.  The principal
           buyers continue to be young marrieds and senior citizens, but the
           market tends to broaden when conventional housing becomes more
           difficult to purchase and finance.

           The recreational vehicle market is made up of vacationing middle
           income families, retired couples traveling around the country and
           sportsmen pursuing four-season hobbies.<PAGE>
           Method of Distribution

           The Company's manufactured homes are distributed by approximately
           1,250 dealers at 1,900 locations throughout the United States     
           and recreational vehicles are distributed by approximately 600    
           dealers at 750 locations throughout the United States.  These     
           are generally not exclusive dealerships and it is believed that   
           most dealers also sell products of other manufacturers.

           The Company provides the retail purchaser of its products with a  
           full one-year warranty against defects in materials and           
           workmanship.  The warranties are backed by a corporate service    
           department and an extensive field service system.

           The Company's products are sold to dealers on a cash basis. 
           Payments to the Company are made either directly by the dealer or
           by financial institutions which have agreed to finance dealer
           purchases of the Company's products.  In accordance with industry
           practice, certain financial institutions which finance dealer
           purchases require the Company to execute repurchase agreements
           which provide that in the event a dealer defaults on its
           repayment of the financing, the Company will repurchase its
           products from the financing institution in accordance with a
           declining repurchase price schedule established by the Company. 
           Any loss under these agreements is the difference between the
           repurchase cost and the resale value of the units repurchased. 
           Further, the risk of loss is spread over numerous dealers.  There
           have been no material losses related to repurchases in past
           years.

           Raw Materials and Supplies

           The Company is basically an assembler of components purchased
           from outside sources.  The major components used by the Company
           are lumber, plywood, steel, aluminum, insulation, home
           appliances, furnaces, plumbing fixtures, hardware, floor
           coverings and furniture.  The suppliers are many and range in
           size from large national companies to very small local
           companies.  At the present time, the Company is obtaining
           sufficient materials to fulfill its needs.

           Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions

           The Company does not rely upon any terminable or nonrenewable
           rights such as patents or licenses or franchises under the
           trademarks or patents of others, in the conduct of any segment of
           its business.
<PAGE>
           Seasonal Fluctuations

           While the Company maintains production of manufactured homes and
           recreational vehicles throughout the year, seasonal fluctuations
           in sales do occur.  Sales and production of manufactured homes
           are affected by winter weather conditions at the Company's
           northern plants.  Recreational vehicle sales are generally higher
           in the spring and summer months than in the fall and winter
           months.

           Inventory

           The Company does not build significant inventories of either
           finished goods or raw materials at any time.  It does not deliver
           on consignment.

           Dependence Upon Individual Customers

           The Company does not rely upon any single dealer for a
           significant percentage of its business in any industry segment.

           Backlog

           The Company does not consider as significant in its business the
           existence and extent of backlog at any given date.  Because the
           Company's production is based on dealers' orders, which
           continuously fluctuate, and a relatively short manufacturing
           cycle, the existence of a backlog does not provide a reliable
           indication of the status of the Company's business.

           Government Contracts

           Two divisions of the Company have government contracts that
           provide a small subsidy for making its electrically heated homes
           more energy efficient.

           Competitive Conditions

           The manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are
           highly competitive, with particular emphasis on price and 
           features offered.  The Manufactured Housing Institute advised
           that approximately 100 manufacturers produced 254,200 homes in
           calendar year 1993.  In the same period, the Company produced
           18,754 units for a 7.4% market share.  In calendar year 1992,
           approximately 100 manufacturers produced 210,800 homes.  In that
           period the Company produced 16,470 homes for a 7.8% market share.

<PAGE>
           The recreational vehicle industry produced 420,200 units in
           calendar year 1993 compared to 389,800 units in calendar year
           1992.  The following table shows the Company's competitive
           position in the recreational vehicle product lines it sells.

           Both the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle segments   
           of the Company's business are dependent upon the availability of  
           financing to dealers and retail financing.  Consequently,         
           increases in interest rates and/or tightening of credit through   
           governmental action or otherwise have adversely affected the      
           Company's business in the past and may do so in the future.  

           The Company considers it impossible to predict the future         
           occurrence, duration or severity of cost or availability          
           problems in financing either manufactured homes or recreational   
           vehicles.  To the extent that they recur, such public concerns    
           will affect sales of the Company's products.

           Regulation

           The manufacture, distribution and sale of manufactured homes and  
           recreational vehicles are subject to government regulations in    
           both the United States and Canada, at federal, state or           
           provincial and local levels.

           Environmental Quality

           The Company believes that compliance with federal, state and      
           local requirements respecting environmental quality will not      
           require any material capital expenditures for plant or equipment  
           modifications which would adversely affect earnings.

<PAGE>
           Other Regulations

           The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has    
           set national manufactured home construction and safety standards  
           and implemented recall and other regulations since 1976.  The     
           National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of     
           1974, as amended, under which such standards and regulations are  
           promulgated, prohibits states from establishing or continuing in  
           effect any manufactured home standard that is not identical to    
           the federal standards as to any covered aspect of performance.    
           Implementation of these standards and regulations involves        
           inspection agency approval of manufactured home designs, plant    
           and home inspection by states or other HUD-approved third         
           parties, manufacturer certification that the standards are met,   
           and possible recalls if they are not or if homes contain safety   
           hazards.  HUD is currently reviewing the plan approval            
           inspection system and developing new energy conservation          
           standards.  At present, it is not possible to predict what        
           changes may result, or their effect on the industry.

           Some components of manufactured homes may also be subject to      
           Consumer Product Safety Commission standards and recall           
           requirements.  In addition, the Company has voluntarily subjected 
           itself to third party inspection of all of its products           
           nationwide in order to further assure the Company, its dealers,   
           and customers of compliance with established standards.

           The Company's travel trailers continue to be subject to safety    
           standards and recall and other regulations promulgated by the     
           U.S. Department of Transportation under the National Traffic and  
           Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as well as state laws and       
           regulations.  

           The Company's operations are subject to the Federal Occupational  
           Safety and Health Act, and are routinely inspected thereunder.

           The transportation and placement (in the case of manufactured     
           homes) of the Company's products are subject to state highway use 
           regulations and local ordinances which control the size of units  
           that may be transported, the roads to be used, speed limits,      
           hours of travel, and allowable locations for manufactured homes   
           and parks.  The Company is also subject to many state             
           manufacturer licensing and bonding requirements, and to dealer    
           day in court requirements in some states.

           Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles may be subject to    
           the Magnuson-Moss Warranty - Federal Trade Commission Improvement 
           Act, which regulates warranties on consumer products.  The        
           Company believes that its existing warranties meet all            
           requirements of the Act.

           


           HUD has promulgated rules requiring manufacturers of manufactured 
           homes to utilize wood products certified by their suppliers to    
           meet HUD's established limits on formaldehyde emissions, and to   
           place in each home written notice to prospective purchasers of    
           possible adverse reaction from airborne formaldehyde in the       
           homes.  These rules are designated as preemptive of state         
           regulation.  
       
           New wind load regulations become effective in July 1994 for       
           certain hurricane-prone areas.  The Company estimates these       
           regulations will result in an increase of approximately 10% in    
           its average manufactured housing costs for homes sold in the      
           affected areas.

           The National Commission on Manufactured Housing has held          
           hearings to develop recommendations to Congress concerning the    
           regulation of the manufactured housing industry.  The             
           Commission's report is expected to cover regulations relating to  
           inspection, warranty and enforcement.  At this time, the Company  
           cannot predict the effect these recommendations will have on the  
           Company or the manufactured housing industry as a whole.

           Number of Employees

           The Company employs approximately 3,600 people at the present     
           time.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations
      
      
      Liquidity and Capital Resources
      At May 31, 1994 cash and temporary cash investments totaled
      $17,128,000 compared to $13,672,000 at May 31, 1993.  Working
      capital at May 31, 1994 amounted to $47,759,000, an increase of
      $4,347,000 from $43,412,000 at May 31, 1993.  Cash and working
      capital both increased due to the increase in sales volume. 
      Historically, the Company's financing needs have been met
      through funds generated internally.
        
      Capital Expenditures
      Capital expenditures during fiscal 1994 were $8,090,000
      compared to prior year expenditures of $4,134,000.  Capital
      expenditures were made primarily to increase manufacturing
      capacity, adopt new manufacturing processes and increase
      manufacturing efficiencies.  The cash provided by operating
      activities in fiscal 1995 is expected to be adequate to fund
      any capital expenditures which may become necessary during the
      year.  
      
      Results of Operations
      Sales in fiscal 1994 were $580,144,000, an increase of
      $88,428,000 from $491,716,000 in fiscal 1993.  1993 sales were
      up $152,646,000 from $339,070,000 reported for fiscal 1992. 
      Manufactured housing sales totaled $441,422,000 for fiscal 1994
      compared to $362,078,000 in 1993 and $257,077,000 in 1992. 
      Manufactured housing unit sales increased to 19,467 units
      compared to 18,001 units in 1993 and 13,455 units in 1992. 
      Recreational vehicle sales increased to $138,722,000 in 1994
      compared to $129,638,000 in 1993 and $81,993,000 in 1992. 
      Recreational vehicle unit sales increased to 11,997 in fiscal
      1994 compared to 11,863 in 1993 and 7,737 in 1992.  Sales in
      fiscal 1994 reflect an improvement in overall economic
      conditions which contributed to an increase in industry wide
      demand for manufactured housing and recreational vehicles.
      
      Cost of sales in fiscal 1994 was 84.5 percent compared to 85.8
      percent in 1993 and 85.6 percent in 1992.  Cost of sales
      decreased as a percentage of sales due to increased sales
      volume.
      
      Selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 1994 increased as
      a percentage of sales to 12.2 percent from 12.0 percent in 1993
      and 13.5 percent in 1992. The decrease from 1992 was due
      primarily to higher sales volume and overall cost control.
      
            <PAGE>
Interest income amounted to $5,741,000 in 1994 compared to
      $5,667,000 in 1993 and $6,306,000 in 1992.  Interest income is
      directly related to the amount available for investment and the
      prevailing yields of U.S. Government securities.  The increase
      in interest income was due to slightly higher yields during the
      period.
      
      The provision for federal income taxes approximates the
      statutory rate and for state income taxes reflects current
      state rates effective for the period based upon activities
      within each jurisdiction.
      
      The Corporation has determined that the effects on the
      financial statements from any recently issued Accounting
      Standards will not be material.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
      
      To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Skyline
      Corporation
      
      
      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
      the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
      respects, the financial position of Skyline Corporation and its
      subsidiaries at May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
      the period ended May 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
      accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are
      the responsibility of Skyline Corporation management; our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
      statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of
      these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
      standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
      includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
      amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
      the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
      by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
      presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
      basis for the opinion expressed above.
      
      As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective
      June 1, 1992 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

       NOTE 1 Accounting Policies

       The following is a summary of the accounting policies which     
       have a significant effect on the consolidated financial         
       statements.

       Principles of consolidation -- The consolidated financial       
       statements include the accounts of Skyline Corporation and all  
       of its subsidiaries, each of which is wholly-owned.

       Revenue recognition-- Substantially all of the Corporation's    
       products are made to order and are recorded as revenue upon     
       shipment.

       Consolidated statements of cash flows - For purposes of the     
       statements of cash flows, investments in treasury bills are     
       included as investing activities.  The Corporation's cash flows 
       from operating activities were reduced by income taxes paid of  
       $9.9 million, $7.1 million and $3.0 million in 1994, 1993 and   
       1992, respectively.

       Inventory valuation -- Inventories are stated at cost,          
       determined under the first-in, first-out method, which is not   
       in excess of market.

       Depreciation -- Depreciation is computed over the estimated     
       useful lives of the assets for financial statement reporting    
       and accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes.

       Investments -- At May 31, 1994, the Corporation held            
       $89,912,000 (amortized cost) of United States Treasury Notes as 
       long-term investments.  The market and face value of the        
       securities were $89,194,000 and $90,000,000 respectively, at    
       May 31, 1994.  The securities are carried at amortized cost.    
       The Company does not have any other financial instruments       
       which have market values differing from recorded values.

       Warranty -- The Corporation provides a warranty on its          
       products.  Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of 
       sale.

       Income taxes -- The Company adopted Statement of Financial      
       Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting For Income Taxes,"    
       effective June 1, 1992.  The cumulative effect of this change   
       in accounting for income taxes on prior years was $370,000 or   
       $.03 per share.  

       The difference between the Company's statutory Federal Income   
       tax rate and the effective income tax rate is due primarily to  
       state income taxes. 
      
       The Company's deferred tax assets consist primarily of          
       temporary differences in the basis of certain liabilities for   
       financial statement and tax return purposes and its deferred    
       tax liabilities are due to the use of accelerated depreciation  
       methods for tax purposes.  The amounts of such deferred tax     
       items are not significant individually or in the aggregate.<PAGE>

       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

       NOTE 1 Accounting Policies, continued
  

       Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards-- The            
       Corporation has determined that the effects on the financial    
       statements from any recently issued Accounting Standards will   
       not be material.

       Reclassification -- Certain prior year amounts have been        
       reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

       NOTE 2 Contingencies

       The Corporation and its subsidiaries were contingently liable   
       at May 31, 1994, under agreements to purchase repossessed units 
       on floor plan financing made by financial institutions to its   
       customers.  Losses, if any, would be the difference between     
       repossession cost and the resale value of the units.  There     
       have been no material losses in past years under these          
       agreements and none are anticipated in the future.

       The Corporation is a party to various pending legal proceedings 
       in the normal course of business.  Management believes that any 
       losses resulting from such proceedings would not have a         
       material adverse effect on the Corporation's result of          
       operations or financial position.

       NOTE 3 Purchase of Treasury Stock   

       The Corporation's board of directors authorized the repurchase  
       of up to 1.2 million shares of common stock, or approximately   
       ten percent of the shares outstanding, effective December 16,   
       1993.  The purchases would be made in the open market, or in    
       negotiated transactions, at such times and at such prices as    
       management may decide.  During the fourth quarter of 1994 the   
       Corporation repurchased 59,900 shares at an average cost of     
       approximately $17.50 per share.<PAGE>

       NOTE 4 Employee Benefits

       A) PROFIT SHARING PLANS

       The Corporation and its subsidiaries have two deferred profit   
       sharing Plans covering administrative and clerical, and hourly  
       employees, respectively.  The Plans are defined contribution    
       Plans to which the Corporation has the right to modify, suspend 
       or discontinue contributions.  For the years ended May 31,      
       1994, 1993 and 1992, contributions to the Plans were            
       $2,159,000, $1,834,000 and $1,670,000, respectively.

       B) RETIREMENT AND DEATH BENEFIT PLANS

       The Corporation and its subsidiaries have entered into          
       arrangements with certain employees which provide for benefits  
       to be paid to the employees' estates in the event of death      
       during active employment or retirement benefits to be paid over 
       10 years beginning the date of retirement.  To fund all such    
       arrangements, the Corporation purchased life insurance          
       contracts on the related employees.  The present value of the   
       cost of such arrangements is being accrued over the period from 
       the date of such arrangements to full eligibility using a       
       discount rate of 7.25% in 1994 and 8% in 1993 and 1992. The     
       change in the discount rate did not have a significant impact   
       on the financial statements.  The amount charged to operations  
       under these arrangements was $285,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993, and 
       1992.

to the following limitations and not otherwise, to-wit:  (i) no dividend
payable in shares of Class A Common Stock shall be declared on the
Class B Common Stock and no dividend payable in shares of Class B
Common Stock shall be declared on the Class A Common Stock; (ii)
dividends payable in shares of the same class may, from time to time,
be declared on either the Class A or Class B Common Stock, provided
that a dividend payable in shares of the other class, at the same time
and at the same rate per share, is simultaneously declared on such other
class; (iii) dividends payable otherwise than in shares of Class B
Common Stock may in any calendar year be declared on the Class B
Common Stock, provided that the amount of such dividend, together
with any dividends, theretofore, in the same calendar year, declared on
such stock, does not exceed, on a per share basis, one-half of the
amount of any dividend on the Class A Common Stock which is
declared simultaneously with, and payable at the same time as, the
dividend declared on the Class B Common Stock, plus the amount of
all dividends theretofore, in the same calendar year, declared on the
Class A Common Stock.

     B.   In the event of dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, any assets of the
Corporation in excess of its liabilities shall be distributed in the
following order:

          (1). Assets of a value equal to an amount found by
multiplying $15.00  times the number of shares of the Class A
Common Stock then outstanding (provided that, if the number of such
outstanding shares has been changed by  reason of stock dividends,
split-ups, consolidations or other reclassifications occurring at any
time subsequent to the effective date of these Amendments, then,
assets of a value equal to an amount found by multiplying
$15.00 times the number  of shares of the Class A Common Stock
that would be outstanding by for such   stock dividends, split-ups,
consolidations or other reclassifications) shall be distributed to
the holders of the Class A Common Stock in accordance with the
number of such shares held by each; and then

          (2). Assets of a value equal to an amount found by
multiplying $15.00  times the number of shares of Class B Common
Stock then outstanding (subject to the same proviso applicable
to the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock) shall be
distributed to the holders thereof in accordance with the number of
shares held by each; and then

          (3). The assets remaining shall be distributed among
the holders of both the Class A and Class B Common Stock, on a
share for share basis, without preference or distinction as to class.

If in making any distribution under subparagraphs 1 and 2 above, the
net or remaining assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to
permit a distribution of the full amount provided for in either of such
subparagraphs, all of the assets shall be distributed to the holders of the
class of stock specified in such subparagraph on a share for share basis.

     C.   On January 1, 1963, and again on January 1, 1964,
38,333 shares (on a cumulative basis) of Class B Common Stock, (or,
in case of changes in the number of outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock because of stock dividends, split-ups, consolidations or
other re-classifications occurring at any time subsequent to the effective
date of these Amendments, such number as would equal 38,333 shares
of Class B Common Stock but for such stock dividends, split-ups,
consolidations or other reclassifications), to be chosen as hereinafter
provided (and on January 1, 1965, the balance of all shares of Class B
Common Stock outstanding on, or issued after, that date), shall become
convertible, at the option of the holders thereof and upon surrender to
the Corporation or to any Transfer Agent of the Class A Common
Stock of the certificate for the shares so to be converted, into fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock at the rate of one
share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common
Stock tendered for conversion.  Upon such conversion of any shares of
Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock no
allowance or adjustment shall be made for dividends on either class of
stock.

     The particular shares of Class B Common Stock at the time
outstanding which are to become eligible for conversion into Class A
Common Stock on January 1, 1963, and 1964 shall be fixed and
identified from time to time by resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Directors on a substantially pro-rata basis between the holders at
such times of the outstanding Class B Common Stock, and a certified
copy of each such resolution or resolutions shall be forthwith delivered
by the Corporation to the Transfer Agent for the Class A Common
Stock.

     The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out
of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock the full
number of shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable upon the
conversion of all shares of Class B Common Stock, from time to time
outstanding.

     Shares of Class B Common Stock which have been converted
into shares of Class A Common Stock, as herein provided, shall not be
re-issued but shall be cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the
laws of the State of Indiana.

     D.   The Corporation shall not declare a split-up,
consolidation or other re-classification of either the Class A or Class B
Common Stock into a different number of shares of such class, unless
it simultaneously declares a split-up, consolidation or other re-
classification, as the case may be, of the other class into a different
number of shares at the same rate per share.

     E.   In the event that:

          (1). Mr. Arthur J. Decio shall cease to act on a full
time basis as the   principal executive officer of the Corporation
(except for such reasonable and ordinary interruptions of a temporary
nature as may occur by reason of illness or like causes) whether
such cessation is due to the termination of his employment by
the Corporation, by his own act, because of his death or
permanent disability, or for any other reason whatsoever; or

          (2). The amount of outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock shall be reduced in number to less than 50,000
shares, or, in case of changes in the number of outstanding shares
of Class B Common Stock because of stock dividends, split-ups,
consolidations or other re-classifications occurring at any time
subsequent to  the effective date of this Amendment, then to less
than such number as would equal 50,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock, but for such stock dividends, split-ups,      
consolidations or other re-classifications;

then, upon the occurrence of either of such events, each one of the then
authorized shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock, whether
unissued, issued and outstanding, or held in the treasury of the
Corporation, shall ipso facto become and be, without further action of
the Corporation or its stockholders, one share of Common Stock, with
a par value of $1.00 per share, and all such shares shall be of one and
the same class, with equal and identical rights, privileges, powers,
obligations, restrictions and voting rights, and all distinctions in regard
to preference, qualifications, restrictions, limitations and special or
relative rights or powers theretofore applicable to the Class A and Class
B Common Stock, described in this Article VI and the following Article
VII, shall cease to exist.

     F.   No stockholder of the Corporation of any class, shall
have a preemptive right to purchase, subscribe for, or take any part of
any stock or any part of any notes, debentures, bonds or other
securities, whether or not convertible into, or carrying options or
warrants to purchase, stock of this corporation hereafter issued,
optioned or sold by it.

                     ARTICLE VII
           Voting Rights of Capital Stock

     A.   All holders of record of any class or classes of stock of
the Corporation shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such
class or classes so held, upon any question presented at a regular or
special meeting of shareholders.

     At any election of directors held prior to the occurrence of either
of the events described in Subsection (1) and (2) of Section E of the
preceding Article VI, the record holders of the Class B Common Stock
shall have the right to elect such number of the directors as will
constitute two-thirds in number of the full Board of Directors of the
Corporation, and if the number of places on the full Board of Directors
is not divisible by three, then the holders of the Class B Common Stock
shall have the right to elect the smallest number of directors sufficient
to constitute more than two-thirds in number of such full Board of
Directors (the directors so elected to be known as Class B Directors),
and the record holders of the Class A Common Stock shall have the
right to elect the remaining number of directors to be elected at such
meeting (the directors so elected to be known as Class A Directors). 
All such Directors shall be elected by a majority vote of the record
holders of the Class A or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be,
each such holder having one vote for each share of stock of such class
so held.  If the office of any Class A or Class B Director becomes
vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,
removal from office or otherwise, a majority of the remaining Class A
or Class B Directors, as the case may be, shall choose a successor who
shall hold office for the unexpired term to which such vacancy
occurred, or until the next election of directors.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing if prior to the issuance of any shares of Class A Common
Stock, any vacancies shall occur on the Board of Directors because of
an increase in the number of Directors of the Corporation, then each
such vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote of the record holders of
the Class B Common Stock, each such holder having one vote for each
share of such stock so held, and after such election, each Director so
elected shall be designated as either a Class A or Class B Director by
a majority vote of the such holders of Class B Common Stock.

     At any election of Directors held subsequent to the occurrence
of either of the aforesaid events, each Director shall be elected by a
majority vote of the record holders of all class or classes of stock of this
Corporation, without distinction as to class, each such holder having
one vote for each share of stock of such class or classes so held.

     The shareholders shall at no time have the right to accumulate
their votes and distribute them among the candidates for election to the
Board of Directors.

     B.   Until the occurrence of either of the events described in
Subsections (1) and (2) of Section E of the preceding Article VI, the
Corporation shall not amend, alter, change, add to, or repeal any of the
provisions of the preceding Articles V or VI or of this Article VII or
enter into any agreements of merger or consolidation, or take any action
with respect to the Class A Common Stock, other than the declaration
or payment of any cash dividend or dividends thereon, which action, in
the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, would
materially and adversely affect the conversion rights of the Class B
Common Stock as set forth in Section C of the preceding Article VI,
without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-
thirds of the Class A Common Stock at the time outstanding, voting as
a class, and at least one-half of the Class B Common Stock at the time
outstanding, voting as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in
writing or, by resolution adopted at a duly called meeting of
shareholders; and after the occurrence of either of such events
described in Subsections (1) and (2) of Section E of the preceding
Article VI, the Corporation shall not amend, alter, change, add to, or
repeal any of the provisions of the preceding Article V or VI of this
Article VII or enter into an agreement of merger or consolidation,
without the affirmative vote or consent os the holders of at least two-
thirds of the Common Stock, par value of $1.00 per share, at the time
outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing, or by
resolution adopted at a duly called meeting of shareholders.

              Data Respecting Directors
                     I.  Number

     The Corporation shall have such number of directors as shall be
specified in the By-Laws, but in no event shall such number be less
than three nor more than nine.

                 2.  Qualifications

     Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation.  A
majority of the Directors at any time shall be citizens of the United
States.

                     ARTICLE XII
      Provisions for Regulation of Business and
          Conduct of Affairs of Corporation

     A.   The Board of Directors shall have the power, without the
consent or vote of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add
to, or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.

     B.   The Corporation shall have the power to carry on and
conduct its business or any part thereof, and to have one or more
offices, in the State of Indiana, and in all other states, territories,
colonies and dependencies of the United States, in the District of
Columbia and in all or any foreign countries throughout the world; and
to acquire, own, hold or use and to lease, mortgage, pledge, sell,
convey or otherwise dispose of property, real and/or personal, tangible

Amendments, the number of shares voted in favor of the adoption of
The Amendments, and the number of shares voted against such
adoption are as follows:  10,000 shares of the Corporation's Common
Stock, par value $10.00 per share were entitled to vote in respect of
The Amendments and all such shares were voted in favor of the

              ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
                         OF
                 SKYLINE HOMES, INC.

     The undersigned officers of SKYLINE HOMES, INC.
(hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation"), existing pursuant to the
provisions of the Indiana General Corporation Act, as amended
(hereinafter referred to as the "Act"), desiring to give notice of
corporate action effectuating amendment of certain individual Articles
of its Articles of Incorporation, certify the following facts:

                    SUBDIVISION A
                   THE AMENDMENTS

     The exact texts of Articles V, VI, VII, IX and XII of the Articles
of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended (hereinafter referred
to as "The Amendments"), now are as follows:

                      ARTICLE V
               Amount of Capital Stock

     The total number of shares into which the authorized capital
stock of the Corporation is divided is hereby changed from 615,000
shares, consisting of 500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and
115,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, each such class having a par
value of $1.00 per share, to 915,000 shares, consisting of 695,000
shares of Class A Common Stock and 220,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock, each such class having a par value of $.50 per share.

     At the close of business on the date that these Amendments shall
become effective, each share of Class A Common Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Corporation issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the close of business on said effective date, shall be exchanged
for two shares of Class A Common Stock, par value 50 cents per share,
of the Corporation.

     At the close of business on the date that these Amendments shall
become effective, each share of Class B Common Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Corporation issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the close of business on said effective date, shall be exchanged
for two shares of Class B Common Stock, par value 50 cents per share,
of the Corporation.

     Such exchange and conversion will be accomplished as follows: 
At the close of business on said effective date, each stock certificate
issued and outstanding prior to the close of business on the date that
these Amendments shall become effective, shall, without further action
by the Corporation or its shareholders, automatically be converted to
a certificate for a like number of shares of Common Stock of the same
class of 50 cents par value per share in partial exchange for the $1.00
par value Common Stock, and the Corporation or any Transfer Agent
for said Classes of Stock shall issue to each shareholder another stock
certificate for a like number of new shares of 50 cents par value
Common Stock of the same class to complete said exchange and
conversion.

     Upon the occurrence of either of the events described in
Subsections (1) and (2) of Section E of the following Article VI, each
one of the then authorized shares of Class A and Class B Common
Stock, whether unissued, issued and outstanding or held in the treasury
of the Corporation, shall ipso facto become and be, without further
action by the Corporation or its shareholders, one share of Common
Stock with the par value of 50 cents per share, and the holders of shares
of the Class A or Class B Common Stock, shall have the right to
surrender the certificates representing such shares to the Corporation
or to any Transfer Agent for the Common Stock, par value of 50 cents
per share, and receive duly executed certificates representing an equal
number of shares of said Common Stock, par value of 50 cents per
share.

                     ARTICLE VI
               Terms of Capital Stock

     The preferences, qualifications, restrictions, limitations and
special or relative rights and powers of the shares of Class A and Class
B Common Stock are as follows:

     A.   Such dividends as may be determined by the Board of
Directors may be paid on the Class A and Class B Common Stock, at
any time and from time to time, out of the assets of the Corporation
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Indiana, subject
to the following limitations and not otherwise, to-wit:  (i) no dividend
payable in shares of Class A Common Stock shall be declared on the
Class B Common Stock and no dividend payable in shares of Class B
Common Stock shall be declared on the Class A Common Stock; (ii)
dividends payable in shares of the same class may, from time to time,
be declared on either the Class A or Class B Common Stock, provided
that a dividend payable in shares of the other class, at the same time
and at the same rate per share, is simultaneously declared on such other
class; (iii) dividends payable otherwise than in shares of Class B
Common Stock may in any calendar year be declared on the Class B
Common Stock, provided that the amount of such dividend, together
with any dividends, theretofore, in the same calendar year, declared on
such stock, does not exceed, on a per share basis, one-half of the
amount of any dividend on the Class A Common Stock which is
declared simultaneously with, and payable at the same time as, the
dividend declared on the Class B Common Stock, plus the amount of
all dividends theretofore, in the same calendar year, declared on the
Class A Common Stock.

     B.   In the event of dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, any assets of the
Corporation in excess of its liabilities shall be distributed in the
following order:

          (1). Assets of a value equal to an amount found by
multiplying $7.50   times the number of shares of the Class A
Common Stock then outstanding (provided that, if the number of such
outstanding shares has been changed by  reason of stock dividends,
split-ups, consolidations, or other reclassifications  occurring at any
time subsequent to the effective date of these Amendments, then,
assets of a value equal to an amount found by multiplying $7.50
times the number of shares of the Class A Common Stock that would
be outstanding but for such stock dividends, split-ups,
consolidations or other reclassifications) shall be distributed to
the holders of the Class A Common Stock in accordance with the
number of such shares held by each; and then

          (2). Assets of a value equal to an amount found by
multiplying $7.50 times the number of shares of Class B Common
Stock then outstanding (subject to the same proviso applicable
to the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock) shall be
distributed to the holders thereof in accordance with the number of
shares held by each; and then

          (3). The assets remaining shall be distributed among
the holders of both the Class A and Class B Common Stock, on a
share for share basis, without preference or distinction as to class.

If in making any distributions under subparagraphs 1 and 2 above, the
net or remaining assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to
permit a distribution of the full amount provided for in either of such
subparagraphs, all of the assets shall be distributed to the holders of the
class of stock specified in such subparagraph on a share for share basis.

     C.   On January 1, 1963, and again on January 1, 1964,
73,333 shares (on a cumulative basis) of Class B Common Stock, (or,
in case of changes in the number of outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock because of stock dividends, split-ups, consolidations or
other reclassifications occurring at any time subsequent to the effective
date of these Amendments, such number as would equal 73,333 shares
of Class B Common Stock but for such stock dividends, split-ups,
consolidations or other reclassifications), to be chosen as hereinafter
provided (and on January 1, 1965, the balance of all shares of Class B
Common Stock outstanding on, or issued after, that date), shall become
convertible, at the option of the holders thereof and upon surrender to
the Corporation or to any Transfer Agent of the Class A Common
Stock of the certificate for the shares so to be converted, into fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock at the rate of one
share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common
Stock tendered for conversion.  Upon such conversion of any shares of
Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock no
allowance or adjustment shall be made for dividends on either class of
stock.

     The particular shares of Class B Common Stock at the time
outstanding which are to become eligible for conversion into Class A
Common Stock on January 1, 1963, and 1964 shall be fixed and
identified from time to time by resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Directors on a substantially pro-rata basis between the holders at
such times of the outstanding Class B Common Stock, and a certified
copy of each such resolution or resolutions shall be forthwith delivered
by the Corporation to the Transfer Agent for the Class A Common
Stock.

     The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out
if its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock the full
number of shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable upon the
conversion of all shares of Class B Common Stock, from time to time
outstanding.

     Shares of Class B Common Stock which have been converted
into shares of Class A Common Stock, as herein provided, shall not be
re-issued but shall be cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the
laws of the State of Indiana.

     D.   The Corporation shall not declare a split-up,
consolidation or other re-classification of either the Class A or Class B
Common Stock into a different number of shares of such class, unless
it simultaneously declares a split-up, consolidation or other re-
classification, as the case may be, of the other class into a different
number of shares at the same rate per share.

     E.   In the event that:

          (1). Mr. Arthur J. Decio shall cease to act on a full
time basis as the principal executive officer of the Corporation
(except for such reasonable and ordinary interruptions of a temporary
nature as may occur by reason of illness or  like causes) whether
such cessation is due to the termination of his employment by
the Corporation, by his own act, because of his death or
permanent disability, or for any other reason whatsoever; or

          (2). The amount of outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock shall be reduced in number to less than 100,000
shares, or, in case of changes in the number of outstanding shares
of Class B Common Stock because of stock dividends, split-  ups,
consolidations or other re-classifications occurring at any time
subsequent to  the effective date of this Amendment, then to less
than such number as would equal 100,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock, but for such stock dividends, split-ups,      
consolidations or other re-classifications;

then, upon the occurrence of either of such events, each one of the then
authorized shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock, whether
unissued, issued and outstanding, or held in the treasury of the
Corporation, shall ipso facto become and be, without further action of
the Corporation or its stockholders, one share of Common Stock with
a par value of 50 cents per share, and all such shares shall be of one
and the same class, with equal and identical rights, privileges, powers,
obligations, restrictions and voting rights, and all distinctions in regard
to preference, qualifications, restrictions, limitations and special or
relative rights or powers theretofore applicable to the Class A and Class
B Common Stock, described in this Article VI and the following Article
VII, shall cease to exist.

     F.   No stockholder of the Corporation of any class, shall
have a preemptive right to purchase, subscribe for, or take any part of
any stock or any part of any notes, debentures, bonds or other
securities, whether or not convertible into, or carrying options or
warrants to purchase, stock of this Corporation hereafter issued,
optioned or sold by it.

                     ARTICLE VII
           Voting Rights of Capital Stock

     A.   All holders of record of any class or classes of stock of
the Corporation shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such
class or classes so held, upon any question presented at a regular or
special meeting of shareholders.

     At any election of directors held prior to the occurrence of either
of the events described in Subsection (1) and (2) of Section E of the
preceding Article VI, the record holders of the Class B Common Stock
shall have the right to elect such number of the directors as will
constitute two-thirds in number of the full Board of Directors of the
Corporation, and if the number of places on the full Board of Directors
is not divisible by three, then the holders of the Class B Common Stock
shall have the right to elect the smallest number of directors sufficient
to constitute more than two-thirds in number of such full Board of
Directors (the directors so elected to be known as Class B Directors),
and the record holders of the Class A Common Stock shall have the
right to elect the remaining number of directors to be elected at such
meeting (the directors so elected to be known as Class A Directors). 
All such Directors shall be elected by a majority vote of the record
holders of the Class A or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be,
each such holder having one vote for each share of stock of such class
so held.  If the office of any Class A or Class B Directors becomes
vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,
removal from office or otherwise, a majority of the remaining Class A
or Class B Directors, as the case may be, shall choose a successor who
shall hold office for the unexpired term to which such vacancy
occurred, or until the next election of directors.

     At any election of Directors held subsequent to the occurrence
of either of the aforesaid events, each Director shall be elected by a
majority vote of the record holders of all class or classes of stock of this
Corporation, without distinction as to class, each such holder having
one vote for each share of stock of such class or classes so held.

     The shareholders shall at no time have the right to accumulate
their votes and distribute them among the candidates for election to the
Board of Directors.

     B.   Until the occurrence of either of the events described in
Subsections (1) and (2) of Section E of the preceding Article VI, the
Corporation shall not amend, alter, change, add to, or repeal any of the
provisions of the preceding Articles V or VI or of this Article VII or
enter into any agreements of merger or consolidation, or take any action
with respect to the Class A Common Stock, other than the declaration
or payment of any cash dividend or dividends thereon, which action, in
the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, would
materially and adversely affect the conversion rights of the Class B
Common Stock as set forth in Section C of the preceding Article VI,
without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-
thirds of the Class A Common Stock at the time outstanding, voting as
a class, and at least one-half of the Class B Common Stock at the time
outstanding, voting as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in
writing or, by resolution adopted at a duly called meeting of
shareholders; and after the occurrence of either of such events
described in Subsections (1) and (2) of Section E of the preceding
Article VI, the Corporation shall not amend, alter, change, add to, or
repeal any of the provisions of the preceding Article V or VI of this
Article VII or enter into an agreement of merger or consolidation,
without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-
thirds of the Common Stock, par value of 50 cents per share, at the time
outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing, or by
resolution adopted at a duly called meeting of shareholders.

                 2.  Qualifications

     Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation.  A
majority of the Directors at any time shall be citizens of the United

          Conduct of Affairs of Corporation
