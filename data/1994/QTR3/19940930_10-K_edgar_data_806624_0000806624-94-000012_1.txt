  Item 1.  BUSINESS

  General

       Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. ("Delta Woodside" or the
  "Company") is a South Carolina corporation with its principal
  executive offices located at 233 North Main Street, Hammond
  Square, Suite 200, Greenville, South Carolina 29601 (telephone
  number: 803-232-8301).  All references herein to Delta Woodside
  or the Company refer to Delta Woodside Industries, Inc., its
  subsidiaries and its predecessor, Delta Woodside Industries,
  Inc., a Delaware corporation (which was incorporated in 1986),
  unless the context otherwise indicates.

       The Company manufactures and markets woven and knitted
  fabrics and apparel.  The Company's textile segment produces a
  range of cotton, synthetic and blended fabrics, woven and knit,
  which are sold for the ultimate production of apparel, home
  furnishings and other products.  The Company's apparel segment
  produces woven and knit apparel, including the "Duck Head" (Reg.
  trademark) line of casualwear marketed primarily in the
  Southeastern United States to department stores and specialty
  apparel retailers.  The Company also operates 36 retail apparel
  outlet stores that sell primarily closeout and irregular "Duck
  Head" products and other woven and knit casualwear produced by
  the "Duck Head" division and other manufacturers.  The Company
  also manufactures and distributes physical fitness equipment
  under the "Nautilus" (Reg. trademark) name.  In June 1994, the
  Company sold its office products business.  The Company has
  operations in 15 states and Costa Rica and employs approximately
  8,100 employees.

  Products, Marketing and Manufacturing

       The Company conducts its textile fabrics operations through
  the Delta Mills Marketing (woven fabrics) and Stevcoknit (knitted
  fabrics) divisions.  It conducts its woven and its knit apparel
  operations through the "Duck Head" and "Delta Apparel" (Reg.
  trademark) divisions.  Certain retail sales of "Duck Head" and
  other manufacturers' products are made through the "Duck Head"
  Retail outlet stores.  Each division has its own management and
  employees and operates independently of the other divisions.
  Inter-segment sales in fiscal 1994, fiscal 1993 and 1992
  accounted for no more than approximately 4%, 3% and 3%,
  respectively, of the total sales of any segment.

       Fabrics produced by Delta Woodside are either woven or
  knitted and are manufactured from cotton, wool or synthetic
  fibers or from synthetic filament yarns.  Cotton and wool are
  purchased from
  numerous suppliers.  Synthetic fiber and synthetic filament yarns
  are purchased from a smaller number of competitive suppliers.




                                  4
<PAGE>
       The Company sells its woven fabrics primarily to numerous
  apparel manufacturers and apparel and fabric resellers, including
  Levi, Haggar and Farah and private label apparel manufacturers
  for J. C. Penney, Sears and other retailers.  The Company's
  knitted fabrics are sold for production of apparel for ultimate
  sales to catalogue companies, as well as to other branded and
  private label manufacturers.  Apparel products are sold primarily
  to department and specialty retailers under the Company's "Duck
  Head" label, to private label apparel resellers and to screen
  printers.

       Textile Segment

       The textile segment manufactures and markets woven and
  knitted fabrics to manufacturers of apparel and home furnishings
  and other products.  The Company's net sales of woven fabrics
  were $288.6 million, $325.1 million and $336.9 million and the
  Company's net sales of knit fabrics were $102.8 million, $119.9
  million and $135.9 million, during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
  respectively.

       Delta Mills Marketing Company (Woven Fabrics).  Delta Mills
  Marketing Company produces finished and unfinished woven fabrics
  used in the production of apparel, home furnishings and other
  products.  "Finished" fabric refers to fabric which has been
  treated by washing, bleaching, dyeing and applying certain
  chemical finishes.  Finished apparel fabric is ready to be cut
  and sewn into garments and is typically sold to manufacturers of
  apparel.

  Unfinished fabric, commonly referred to as "greige"  (pronounced
  "gray") goods, is typically sold to converters who subsequently
  finish the fabric and sell it to manufacturers of apparel, home
  furnishings and other products.  Through fiscal 1990, the
  Company's finished and unfinished woven fabric businesses
  operated as separate divisions under the names "Delta Mills
  Marketing Company" and "Woodside Mills, Inc."  The two businesses
  together now comprise Delta Mills Marketing Company.



  Item 1 (Continued)

       Finished Woven Fabrics.  The Company's finished woven
  fabrics operation, through 7 of its plants, manufactures medium-
  weight woven fabrics sold in a finished state for use in the
  manufacture of men's and women's apparel and professional
  uniforms.

       Finished woven fabrics produced by the division are
  primarily sold directly to major apparel manufacturers.  The
  division's marketing efforts focus on four primary apparel
  manufacturing groups:  women's apparel, including fashion
  apparel; men's apparel; career apparel and uniforms; and military



                                  5
<PAGE>
  and other government uniforms and apparel.  The division also
  engages in commission finishing, whereby it finishes fabric for
  converters.  The finished woven fabrics operation sells and
  distributes its fabrics through Delta Mills Sales Company, a
  marketing office based in New York City, with sales personnel
  also operating from Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, San
  Francisco and London.

       Approximately 65% of the division's finished woven fabrics
  are made from cotton or cotton/synthetic blends, while
  approximately 35% are made from spun synthetics, including
  varying blends of rayon, polyester and wool.  Finished woven
  fabrics are principally woven according to projected sales based
  on strong indications from major customers, but finished
  according to specific purchase orders.  The division's production
  of cotton and cotton/synthetic blend finished woven fabrics is
  largely integrated, with the division performing most of its own
  spinning and substantially all of its own weaving and finishing.
  The production of spun synthetic finished woven fabrics is fully
  integrated, with various plants in the division involved in
  spinning, weaving and finishing.  With its printing capability,
  the Company believes that the division is the only substantially
  vertically integrated producer of camouflage military fabrics in
  the United States.  The Company expects that its finished woven
  all cotton facilities will run at or near full capacity during
  fiscal 1995.  However, woven synthetic and greige goods
  facilities are not expected to run full schedules for at least
  the first half of fiscal 1995.

       Unfinished Woven Fabrics.  The division, through the three
  plants included in its Woodside operation, produces a variety of
  unfinished light-weight woven fabrics sold for ultimate use in
  manufacturing apparel such as blouses, dresses and pajamas, and
  in manufacturing home furnishings, including draperies, curtains
  and comforters, and in medical and industrial products.

       The Woodside operation sells its products primarily to
  converters who arrange for the dyeing, printing and finishing of
  the fabric before ultimately selling the fabric to apparel, home
  furnishing and other manufacturers.  Woodside's marketing and
  sales are also performed by Delta Mills Sales Company, through
  its offices in New York City and additional sales personnel in
  the Boston, Massachusetts area.  The Company sells to more than
  150 converters and other customers. Woodside's operations are
  designed to allow for changes in production to different items in
  its various product lines, thus allowing it to respond to shifts
  in market demand.  Orders generally are received three to six
  months in advance, with products generally made to customer
  specifications.

       Fabrics sold by the Woodside operation include 100% cotton,
  polyester/cotton blends, 100% polyester, 100% rayon,
  polyester/rayon blends, textured polyester and other "semifancy"
  fabrics of more complicated construction.  The Woodside operation
  also produces acetate fabrics used for apparel linings, surgical


                                  6
<PAGE>
  tapes and other industrial and home furnishing uses.  Woodside's
  operations are largely integrated.  All of the operation's plants
  weave fabrics and one of the plants spins some of the yarn used
  to manufacture these fabrics.  The Woodside operation currently
  is operating at less than full production capacity.

       Stevcoknit (Knitted Fabrics).  Stevcoknit, through its 5
  plants, spins yarn, knits and finishes a wide range of circular
  knit fabrics for use in the manufacture of knit apparel, and also
  provides yarn to the Company's apparel segment.

       Stevcoknit products are marketed to numerous apparel
  manufacturers through marketing staffs employed by Stevcoknit
  Marketing Company in New York City and Los Angeles, with sales
  personnel also located in North Carolina, Dallas and San
  Francisco.  To further promote sales of Stevcoknit's fabrics to
  apparel manufacturers, the marketing staff of Stevcoknit
  Marketing Company also contacts major retailers of products
  manufactured from the division's knitted fabrics.  Discussions
  with these retailers provide information relating to fabric
  quality and trends in style and color.  In addition to its sales
  to apparel manufacturers, the division also sells prepared for
  print fabrics to converters through a broker.  Certain knitting
  operations are scheduled according to projected sales, but most
  knitting and finishing of the fabrics are performed to specific
  customer orders.

       The operations within the knitted fabrics operation are
  largely integrated.  Various plants are equipped to perform all
  stages of the manufacturing process, from carding the raw fiber
  stock, to dyeing and finishing the final fabric product.  The
  fabrics produced by this segment are  manufactured by using

  Item 1 (Continued)

  100% cotton, polyester/cotton blends and 100% polyester.  The
  Company believes that its knit textile facilities will run at or
  near full capacity during fiscal 1995.

       Apparel Segment

       The apparel segment produces and markets both woven apparel
  and knit apparel.  The segment's products include the "Duck Head"
  line of men's and boys' casualwear, which includes pants,
  shorts and shirts.  The knit apparel business includes T-shirts
  and sweatshirts which are sold under the labels of "Duck Head",
  "Delta Apparel", and various private labels.

       "Duck Head" Division.  The division produces a line of men's
  and boys' casual apparel, sold under the "Duck Head" label,
  including pants, shorts, shirts, skirts and accessories.  This
  division also sells a relatively small amount of men's and boys'
  woven workwear, sportswear and casualwear under the private
  labels of its customers.  In fiscal 1994 the division began
  licensing various other categories of apparel and accessories.


                                  7

<PAGE>
       "Duck Head" labeled products are primarily marketed by sales
  staff employed by Duck Head Marketing Company to regional and
  national retailers with stores in the South and South Atlantic
  regions.  The "Duck Head" trademark has been associated with
  apparel for many decades, but has traditionally been marketed
  primarily to a Southeastern customer base.  The Company acquired
  the brand in February 1989.

       The division sells its "Duck Head" products primarily to
  regional and national department store chains as well as
  specialty apparel retailers and through Company-operated outlet
  stores.  The division currently displays "Duck Head" products in
  "Duck Head" specialty departments within some department stores.
  The "specialty department" display format permits the
  presentation of an entire line of clothing in a dedicated section
  of a store's clothing department, and has been increasingly used
  in department stores by the major national clothing brands.  The
  Company believes that these specialty
  department displays will continue to increase recognition of the
  "Duck Head" name and logo and expand consumer acceptance of the
  line.  Gross sales of "Duck Head" labeled products were
  approximately $130.4 million in fiscal 1992, $137.3 million in
  fiscal 1993, and $95.4 million in fiscal 1994.

       "Duck Head" Apparel operates a total of 9 facilities located
  in Georgia, Tennessee and Costa Rica.  The division purchases the
  fabrics used in its products from a number of producers.  "Duck
  Head" is now acquiring less than one-half of its finished
  products from other companies throughout the world.  This outside
  production takes the form of sewing fabric parts cut at "Duck
  Head" facilities, cutting and sewing with fabric and patterns
  supplied by "Duck Head", or providing finished garments made to
  "Duck Head" specifications.  The division maintains a staff of
  quality specialists who consistently monitor work in process at
  outside companies.  The Company believes that there is ample
  capacity among outside contractors worldwide to meet its future
  production requirements.  The majority of the products is
  warehoused in the division's leased facilities.

       "Duck Head" labeled apparel items are generally required to
  be inventoried to permit quick shipment and to level production
  schedules, and customer private label apparel items are generally
  made only to order.  The division's products are manufactured
  primarily from 100% cotton.  The division's marketing office is
  based in Winder, Georgia with regional sales managers and sales
  personnel located throughout the country.

       "Delta Apparel".  "Delta Apparel", which is headquartered in
  Duluth, Georgia, operates a total of 9 facilities and produces
  knitted T-shirts and sweatshirts.  The division markets its
  products primarily to companies that screen print shirts for
  resale, and to department stores and other clothing stores for
  resale under the customer's private labels or under the Company's
  "Delta Apparel" label.


                                  8
<PAGE>

       The division's knit apparel marketing is performed by sales
  personnel of Delta Apparel Marketing Company with sales personnel
  located throughout the country.  Sales personnel call directly on
  the retail trade, contacting department stores and the mass
  markets such as discount houses.  This operation utilizes
  independent sales representatives to sell to screen printing
  companies.  Some knit apparel items are required to be
  inventoried to permit quick shipment and to level production
  schedules.  Special fashion knit apparel items and customer
  private label knit apparel styles generally are made only to
  order.

       Of the yarn used by the Company's knit apparel operation,
  approximately one-third is produced by Stevcoknit with the
  remainder purchased from outside vendors; the knit apparel
  operation is otherwise largely vertically integrated.  The
  business manufactures its own knitted fabrics, utilizing

  Item 1 (Continued)

  knitting, dyeing and finishing processes, and cuts and sews its
  finished knitted fabrics into apparel.  The fabrics used by the
  division are either polyester/cotton blends or 100% cotton.

       Retail Apparel.  The Company has 36 outlet stores in 13
  states that sell principally closeout and irregular "Duck Head"
  products.  These stores also sell a small amount of apparel items
  manufactured by other companies.

       Fitness Equipment

       "Nautilus" Fitness Equipment.  Nautilus produces weight
  resistance and aerobic equipment for the institutional, medical
  and home markets. The current product line in the weight
  resistance category is called the "Next Generation", which
  consists of 40 individual machines that exercise the various
  muscle groups.  Nautilus also produces an exclusive line of 25
  weight resistance machines for women called "Nautilus for Women".
  As a supplement to the weight resistance line, Nautilus produces
  five versions of a multi-station machine that serves those
  markets that have space and budget limitations.  Nautilus
  currently produces, for the institutional market, five aerobic
  machines, two recumbent bikes, two stairclimbers and a treadmill.

       Nautilus historically has been focused on the institutional
  market.  During the last six months Nautilus has launched a
  concerted effort to penetrate the home and medical market.
  Nautilus historically targets health clubs, the public sector,
  YMCAs and similar institutions and the medical, amenity and
  corporate markets.  In fiscal 1995, Nautilus plans to enter the
  consumer market in the strength and aerobic areas, as well as
  expand its efforts in the medical markets to the areas of
  diagnosis (exercise components with the ability to measure the



                                  9
<PAGE>
  strength of a particular muscle and muscle group) and
  rehabilitation.

       The manufacturing operations at Nautilus are vertically
  integrated, including metal fabrication, upholstery, and a vacuum
  formed and injection molded plastics process.  Raw material is
  inventoried, but finished machines are generally manufactured
  against customer orders.  All manufacturing is done in
  Independence, Virginia.  The Company believes that the
  manufacturing operation is currently operating at approximately
  75% of present capacity.

  Competition

       The cyclical nature of the textile and apparel industries,
  characterized by rapid shifts in fashion, consumer demand and
  competitive pressures, results in both price and demand
  volatility.  The demand for any particular product varies from
  time to time based largely upon changes in consumer preferences
  and general economic conditions affecting the textile and apparel
  industries, such as consumer expenditures for nondurables.  The
  textile and apparel industries are also cyclical because the
  supply of particular products changes as competitors enter or
  leave the market.  The cyclical nature of the various businesses
  in which the Company operates was a contributing factor to the
  business downturn experienced by the Company in fiscal 1994 and
  1993 and the varying manner in which each division's results in
  one fiscal year differs from its results in another fiscal year.
  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
  Operations and Financial Condition."

       The Company sells primarily to domestic customers and
  competes with numerous competitors, both domestic and foreign.
  The principal competitive factors are price, service, delivery
  time, quality and flexibility, with the significance of each
  factor depending upon the product involved.  The Company's
  competitive position varies among the different goods produced.

       There are several major domestic competitors in the finished
  cotton and cotton/polyester blend woven fabrics area, none of
  which dominates the market.  The Company believes that it has a
  strong competitive position with respect to the manufacture of
  spun synthetic slack-weight and skirt-weight woven fabrics, as
  well as wrinkle-resistant all cotton sportswear fabrics.

       The woven fabrics' Woodside operation is a major supplier of
  both polyester/rayon print cloth used in home furnishings and
  women's blouses and acetate fabric used in apparel linings and
  surgical tapes.  There are several major domestic competitors in
  the Company's acetate linings business and its
  unfinished cotton and cotton/polyester blend print cloth
  business, but no company dominates any of these businesses.

       The knitted fabrics business in which Stevcoknit competes is
  highly competitive with several large competitors.  However, the


                                  10
<PAGE>
  significant vertical integration of Stevcoknit's manufacturing
  operations


  Item 1 (Continued)

  and its experience in performing the more complicated
  manufacturing techniques required in the production of 100%
  cotton fabrics provide the Company with certain competitive
  advantages.  The industry, nevertheless, remains highly
  competitive.


       The apparel segment competes with numerous domestic and
  foreign manufacturers of branded and private label apparel.
  Foreign competition has been an increasingly significant factor
  in the apparel manufacturing industry, particularly with respect
  to items that require labor-intensive production, such as shirts
  and jackets, and high cost luxury items.  Although domestic
  apparel companies must compete to some extent on a price basis
  with foreign competition, the Company's management believes that
  domestic apparel companies can best compete by selling branded
  products, by manufacturing off-shore, by offering product
  flexibility, by responding quickly to changes in consumer demand
  and by providing more timely deliveries.  The latter
  characteristics permit retailers to reduce their inventory costs
  and lower the risk that product availability will not match
  consumer demand.  The Company's operations are oriented toward
  providing its apparel segment and the customers of its textile
  segment with all or some of these competitive advantages.  The
  Company believes that it and its domestic customers can address
  quality control problems more easily than can manufacturers and
  distributors of foreign products.  Furthermore, the customers of
  foreign suppliers generally face letter of credit fees, and
  occasionally face delivery delays and claims resolution
  difficulties.

       Nautilus competes in the institutional fitness market which
  is fragmented and highly competitive.  Nautilus competes with
  several national and local companies.  The fitness equipment
  industry generally competes for business on price, quality,
  specifications and service.  Management of the Company believes
  that Nautilus has a strong competitive position because of its
  high name recognition in markets and its reputation for high
  quality, durable equipment.

       The Company believes that several aspects of its operations
  may mitigate some of the problems posed by competition within the
  domestic textile and apparel industries.  The variety of the
  Company's products offers some degree of protection against the
  cyclical nature of the business of individual products.
  Management of the Company believes that the percentage of its
  production cost attributable to labor is comparable to that of
  its competitors.  Other competitive strengths include:  the
  ability to produce special fabrics such as textured blends; the


                                  11
<PAGE>
  modern equipment in several of its plants; and the Company's
  achievement of substantial vertical integration in its various
  divisions.

  Employees

       The Company has approximately 8,100 employees.  The
  Company's employees are not represented by unions.  The Company
  believes that its relations with its employees are good.

  Environmental and Regulatory Matters

       Delta Woodside is subject to federal, state and local
  environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other
  things, wastewater discharges, storm water flows, air emissions,
  ozone depletion and solid waste disposal.  Delta Woodside's
  plants generate very small quantities of hazardous waste which
  are either recycled or disposed of off-site.  Most of its plants
  are required to possess one or more discharge permits.

       The subsidiary which conducts the finished woven fabrics
  operations is subject to a Consent Order with the South Carolina
  Department of Health and Environmental Control dated September
  26, 1985, which was executed prior to Delta Woodside's
  acquisition of the business.  Pursuant to the Consent Order,
  which arose from a determination that several private drinking
  wells in the area of two of the subsidiary's plants had been
  contaminated, the subsidiary has discontinued the operation near
  these plants of a large spray field into which waste water sludge
  had been disposed and has placed into operation for such purpose
  a new and larger spray field.  Delta Woodside expects that any
  continuing expenditures to comply with the Consent Order will be
  immaterial in amount.

       Some of the Company's plants have been unable to comply with
  the acute toxicity limits contained in the National Pollutant
  Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits held by the Company.
  With respect to certain such plants in North Carolina, the
  Company has signed a Special Order by Consent with the North
  Carolina Department of Environmental Health and Natural Resources
  (DEHNR) which will require the plants to achieve compliance with
  the acute toxicity limits by July 1995.  By a March 1992 letter,
  the Natural Resources Defense Council notified the Company of its
  intent to institute a "citizens' suit" under the Clean Water Act
  for certain alleged NPDES violations in North Carolina.  No such
  suit has been initiated to date.  By reason of the Special Order,
  the Company

  Item 1 (Continued)

  believes that any such suit, and compliance with the Special
  Order, would not have a material adverse impact on the Company.
  With respect to certain South Carolina plants, the Company is
  working with



                                  12
<PAGE>
  the appropriate state agency in developing a corrective action
  plan for addressing the toxicity issue.  The Company is examining
  several courses of action to achieve compliance with its NPDES
  permits and does not believe that the matter will have a material
  adverse impact on the Company.

       Generally, the environmental rules applicable to the Company
  are becoming increasingly stringent.  The Company incurs capital
  and other expenditures in each year that are aimed at achieving
  compliance with current and future environmental standards.  The
  Company does not expect that the amount of such expenditures will
  have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial
  condition.  There can be no assurance, however, that changes in
  federal, state or local regulations, changes in regulatory policy
  or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will
  not require substantial additional expenditures.  Similarly, the
  extent of Delta Woodside's liability, if any, for past failures
  to comply with laws, regulations and permits applicable to its
  operations cannot be determined.

  (2)  "Duck Head" Outlet Stores lease a portion of the facility for

  (3)  Approximately 40,000 square feet are currently not used.
  (4)  The knitted fabrics operation closed this facility during fiscal
       1992.
  (5)  The apparel segment leases certain additional warehouse space from
       time to time.
       Approximately 226,000 square feet is leased currently with leases
       expiring through November 1994.
  (6)  The "Duck Head" Outlet Stores Operation leases 36 facilities in 13
       states, which leased space is Approximately 130,000 square feet.
       These leases expire at various dates through 1998.
  (7)  The knitted fabrics operation closed this facility during fiscal
       1993.
  (8)  These locations will be closed in fiscal 1995.
  (9)  Title to these facilities are held by the county under a fee-in-
       lieu arrangement.

       Except as noted above all of the above production and warehouse
  facilities are owned by Delta Woodside and its subsidiaries, subject in
  certain cases to various outstanding mortgages and security interests.
  The apparel segment's Sparta plant, Sparta, Georgia and San Jose plant
  in San Jose, Costa Rica are leased on a month-to-month basis, and the
  Ashburn Plant in Ashburn, Georgia has a lease which expires `in February
  1999.  The lease of the Tellico Plains Plant has expired and the Company
  is in the process of acquiring the facility for a nominal price.  The
  fitness division leases manufacturing capacity in Independence, Virginia
  which lease expires in July 1998.

       Delta Woodside leases corporate and division administrative offices
  in Greenville, South Carolina.  The lease on the corporate offices
  expires December 1997 and leases on the administrative offices expire in
  2008.  Sales offices are leased in Charlotte, New York, Chicago,
  Raleigh, Newport Beach, San Francisco and Los Angeles with leases
  expiring through February 1998.

       At the date of execution of this Form 10-K, the Company believes
  that its finished woven all cotton plants and its knit textile plants
  are operating virtually at full production capacity while its finished
  woven synthetic and unfinished woven fabrics operations are operating at
  slightly less than full production capacity.  Various factors affect the
  relative use by the Company's apparel segment of its own facilities and
  outside contractors in the various apparel production phases.  This
  segment is currently using all its internal productive capacity.  The
  fitness equipment operation is operating at approximately 75% of its
  production capacity as a result of new building space in excess of
  current volume.

  Item 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

       In its Form 8-K, dated January 11, 1994, and Forms 10-Q for
  the fiscal quarters ended January 1, 1994 and April 2, 1994, the
  Company has previously reported the award on November 24, 1993 by
  a jury in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama (the
  "Circuit Court"), of $29,056,000 to a former Duck Head
  independent sales representative (Ken Hoots) and two of his
  salesmen (Terry Long and Bill Pace) against a subsidiary of the
  Company in a suit captioned "Ken Hoots, Terry Long and Bill Pace
  v. Duck Head Apparel Company Inc. et. al. (the "Hoots Suit").
  The Hoots Suit commenced on March 17, 1993.

       After a hearing, the Circuit Court judge reduced the verdict
  to $22,852,000 and entered
  judgment against the Company's subsidiary on March 28, 1994 as
  follows:

       (a)  $852,000 to the plaintiffs on their claim of breach of
            contract respecting alleged unpaid commissions,
       (b)  $4,000,000 to Ken Hoots, $2,000,000 to Terry Long, and
            $1,000,000 to Bill Pace for mental anguish on their
            claim for fraud, and
       (c)  $15,000,000 to the plaintiffs as punitive damages on
            their claim of fraud.

       The Company believes that the verdict is fundamentally
  unjust and intends vigorously to seek its reversal on appeal.  On
  April 9, 1994, the Company's subsidiary filed a notice of appeal
  of judgment with the Alabama Supreme Court.

       In order to prevent execution of the judgment during the
  appellate process, the Company has guaranteed payment of the
  final adjudicated award and posted bond in the amount of
  $28,565,000.

       The Company is seeking recovery of a portion of the award
  under certain of its insurance policies.  At this time, however,
  there is no assurance that any portion of the award will be
  recovered by the Company through insurance.

       Alabama law permits the plaintiffs to recover interest at
  the rate of 12% per annum on the amount of the final adjudicated
  award from the date the original judgment was entered (November
  24, 1993) until the date that any final adjudicated award is paid
  to the plaintiffs.

       The Company made a charge to income during fiscal 1994 to
  establish reserves which it feels are sufficient in order to
  cover payment of any final adjudicated award.

       A lawsuit with allegations similar to those in the Hoots
  Suit is pending against a subsidiary of the Company in the United
  States District Court for Western District of Kentucky brought by
  an individual (Donnie Cecil) who previously served as an


                                  17
<PAGE>
  independent sales representative for the Duck Head division.  The
  suit was filed on October 1, 1993.  The amount of damages claimed
  in the suit has not yet been determined, and the ultimate impact
  of the suit on the Company is as yet unknown.

       In addition to those actions noted above, from time to time
  the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in legal actions
  arising if the normal course of its business,  including product
  liability claims.  The Company believes that, as a result of its
  legal defenses, insurance arrangements and indemnification
  provisions with parties believed by the Company to be financially
  capable, none of these actions, if decided adversely, should have
  a material adverse effect on its results of operations or
  financial condition taken as a whole.

                    Revolving Credit Facility

     Section   Committed Loans.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of, and in reliance upon the representations and
warranties made under, this Agreement, each Lender severally and not
jointly agrees to make Committed Advances to the Borrower from time
to time, on any Business Day from and after the Effective Date until
the Termination Date, up to an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the
Revolving Credit Facility at such time; provided, however, the sum
of the principal amounts of Committed Loans outstanding plus
Competitive Loans outstanding plus Swingline Loans outstanding shall
not exceed at any time the Revolving Credit Facility.  Each
Committed Loan comprised of (i) Base Rate Advances shall be in an
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof and (ii) Eurodollar Advances shall be in an
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof, and shall consist of Committed Advances of the
same Type made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to
their respective Commitments.  Within the limits of each Lender's
Commitment, the principal amount of any Committed Advance which is
prepaid pursuant to Section 4.4(b) may be reborrowed in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.1.  Each Lender is hereby
authorized to, and prior to any transfer of its Committed Loan Note
each Lender shall, endorse the date and amount of each Committed
Advance made by such Lender to the Borrower and each repayment of
principal of each Committed Advance on the schedule annexed to and
constituting a part of such Committed Loan Note, which endorsement
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the
information so endorsed; provided, that a Lender's failure so to
endorse any Committed Loan Note held by it shall not affect the
Borrower's Obligations hereunder.

     Section   Making Committed Loans.

          (a)  Requests. Committed Loans shall be requested by
     delivery of a Notice of Borrowing, given in the manner
     specified in Section 2.3(a), by the Borrower to the Agent and
     deemed requested as provided in Section 2.3(b), 2.3(c) and
     2.3(d).

          (b)  Disbursement of Committed Loans.  Promptly following
     receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall notify each
     Lender by telephone (confirmed by telecopier or telex),
     telecopier or telex of the date and amount of the Committed
     Loan, the Type of Committed Advances comprising such Committed
     Loan, and, in the case of Eurodollar Advances, the applicable
     interest rate under Section 2.6(b)




<PAGE>





and the Interest Period for such Committed Advances.  Not later than
11:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date specified
for any Committed Loan, each Lender shall make available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office its ratable portion of such
Committed Loan in immediately available funds to the Agent at the
Agent's Office.  After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 5, the
Agent will, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent
to, disburse the proceeds of the Committed Advances made in respect
of each such Committed Loan requested by it pursuant to this Section
2.2, in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately
available funds, by making such funds available to the Borrower at
the Agent's Office or by wire transfer to such account of the
Borrower as the Borrower may instruct the Agent from time to time.

          (c)  Assumption by Agent.  Unless the Agent shall have
     received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any
     Committed Loan that such Lender will not make available to the
     Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Committed Loan, the
     Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
     available to the Agent on the date of such Committed Loan in
     accordance with Section 2.2(b) and the Agent may, in reliance
     upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
     date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent such Lender
     shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the
     Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to
     the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
     together, with interest thereon, for each day from the date
     such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date
     such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the
     Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the
     Committed Advances comprising such Committed Loan and (ii) in
     the case of such Lender, at theFederal Funds Effective Rate.
     If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding
     amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's
     Committed Advance as part of such Committed Loan for purposes
     of this Agreement and the Borrower's obligation under this
     Section 2.2(c) to repay such Committed Advance shall terminate.
     The failure of any Lender to make the Committed Advance to be
     made by it as part of any Committed Loan shall not relieve any
     other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
     Committed Advance on the date of such Committed Loan, or
     relieve any Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make
     its Committed Advance as part of any subsequent Committed Loan,
     but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
     Lender to make the Committed Advance to be made by such other
     Lender as part of any Committed Loan.

     Section   Notice and Manner of Borrowing or Conversion or
Continuation of Committed Loan.

     substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto, provided that if
     such written confirmation differs in any material respect from
     the action taken by the Agent, the records of the Agent shall
     control absent manifest error.

          (b)  The receipt by the Agent of notification from an
     Issuer pursuant to Section 3.3(c)(i) to the effect that a
     drawing has been made under a Letter of Credit and that the
     Borrower and, if applicable, the Subsidiary Guarantor named

     Issuer in accordance with the terms of the related Application,
     either by means of a Swingline Loan as contemplated by Section

     Rate Advances, in the amount of the unreimbursed drawing, to be
     made as of the date such drawing was paid, without regard to
     the times of notice and disbursement set forth in Section
     2.3(a), but subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(c)(ii).

          (c)  The failure of the Borrower to notify the Agent of
     its intention to repay any Competitive Loan on the last day of
     the Interest Period applicable thereto pursuant to Section
     2.8(g) prior to 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on
     the last day of such Interest Period shall be deemed to be a
     Notice of Borrowing in respect of a Committed Loan consisting
     of Base Rate Advances, in the amount of such maturing
     Competitive Loan, to be made as of the last day of the Interest
     Period for such Competitive Loan, without regard to the times
     of notice and disbursement set forth in Section 2.3(a).

          (d)  A demand from the Swingline Lender for repayment of
     Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iv) shall be






<PAGE>

consisting of Base Rate Advances, in the amount of such Swingline
Loans, to be made as of the date of demand for repayment of the
Swingline Loans by the Swingline Lender, without regard to the times
of notice and disbursement set forth in Section 2.3(a), but subject
to the provisions of Section 2.9(b)(iv).

          (e)  Whenever the Borrower desires, subject to the
     provisions of Section 4.2, to convert an outstanding Committed
     Loan into a Committed Loan comprised of Committed Advances of a
     different Type provided for in this Agreement or to continue an
     outstanding Committed Loan for a subsequent Interest Period,
     the Borrower shall notify the Agent (which notice shall be
     irrevocable) by telex, telegraph, telecopy or telephone not
     later than 10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the
     date one Business Day before the day on which a proposed
     conversion of a Committed Loan into, or a continuation of a
     Committed Loan as, a Committed Loan comprised of Base Rate
     Advances is to be effective and three Business Days before the
     day on which a proposed conversion of a Committed Loan into, or
     continuation of a Committed Loan as, a Committed Loan comprised
     of Eurodollar Advances is to be effective (and if the Committed
     Loan to be continued is comprised of Eurodollar Advances, such
     effective date shall be the last day of the Interest Period for
     such Committed Advances). Each such notice (a "Notice of
     Conversion/Continuation") shall (i) identify the Committed Loan
     to be converted or continued, including the Type of Committed
     Advances comprising such Committed Loan, the aggregate
     outstanding principal balance thereof and, in the case of a

     into or continuation as Eurodollar Advances, the Interest
     Period to be applicable to each Type of Committed Advance
     comprising each such converted or continued Committed Loan, and
     shall be immediately followed by a written confirmation thereof
     by such Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto,
     provided that if such written confirmation differs in any
     material respect from the action taken by the Agent, the
     records of the Agent shall control absent manifest error.  The
     Agent shall promptly notify each of the Lenders of its receipt
     of any Notice of Conversion/Continuation pursuant to this
     Section 2.3(e).

          (f)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
     Agreement, the Agent shall cause each Committed Loan to be made
     available to the Borrower on the effective date






<PAGE>





specified therefor in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b);
provided that if such Committed Loan is to be made on a day on which
the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Committed
Loan, the Agent shall apply the proceeds of such new Committed Loan
to make such repayment and only an amount equal to the difference
(if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being
repaid shall be made available by the Agent to the Borrower.

     Section   Duration of Interest Periods; Number of Committed
Loans.

          (a)  Subject to the provisions of the definition of
     "Interest Period", the duration of each Interest Period
     applicable to the Committed Advances comprising a Committed
     Loan shall be as specified in the applicable Notice of
     Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation.  The Borrower
     may elect a subsequent Interest Period to be applicable to any
     Committed Loan by giving a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
     with respect to such Committed Loan in accordance with Section
     2.3(e).

          (b)  If the Agent does not receive a notice of election
     pursuant to Section 2.3(e) of duration of a subsequent Interest
     Period for a Committed Loan comprised of Eurodollar Advances
     within the applicable time limits specified in said Section
     2.3(e), or if, when such notice must be given, a Default or
     Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
     elected to convert such Committed Loan in whole into a
     Committed Loan comprised of Base Rate Advances on the last day
     of the then current Interest Period therefor.

          (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may not
     select an Interest Period (i) that would end, but for the
     provisions of the definition "Interest Period," after the
     Termination Date, or (ii) which, when added to the number of
     Interest Periods then applicable, would result in there being,
     at any one time (and treating all Committed Loans comprised of
     Base Rate Advances as a single Committed Loan) more than ten
     Committed Loans outstanding.

     Section   Repayment.  The principal amount of all Committed
Advances shall be repaid by the Borrower in full on the Termination
Date, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to such
date.

to Committed Loans.

outstanding principal amount thereof, for the period from the date
such Committed Advance is made until the principal amount thereof is
paid or converted to a Committed Advance of a





<PAGE>





different Type, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate, which
rate shall change contemporaneously with any change in the Base
Rate.  Such interest shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date
in respect of such Base Rate Advance outstanding from and after the
immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to such Interest Payment
Date, and upon any prepayment of the principal amount of such Base
Rate Advance or conversion of the principal amount (or any portion
thereof) into a Committed Advance of a different Type, on the
principal amount so prepaid or converted.

     (b) (i) Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate
plus the Applicable Margin.  Such interest shall be payable on each
Interest Payment Date in respect of such Eurodollar Advance.

      (ii)     Additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Eurodollar Advance of each Lender shall also be payable from
the date of such Eurodollar Advance until such principal amount is
paid in full, so long as such Lender shall be required under
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, at an interest
rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by
subtracting (A) the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Advance from (B) the rate obtained by dividing such
Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar
Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable
on each date on which interest is payable on such Eurodollar
Advance.  Such additional interest shall be determined by such
Lender and notified to the Borrower through the Agent.

     Section   Committed Loan Notes.  The Committed Advances made by
each Lender to the Borrower and the obligation of the Borrower to
repay such Committed Advances shall be evidenced by, and be
repayable in accordance with the terms of, a single Committed Loan
Note, made by the Borrower payable to the order of such Lender.

Note shall be dated the Agreement Date and be duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Borrower.

          (a)  Competitive Loans.  The Borrower may, from and after
     the Effective Date until the Termination Date subject to
     satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing set forth in
     Section 5.2, request and each Lender may, in its sole
     discretion, agree to make Competitive Loans to the Borrower;
     provided, however, the sum of the principal amounts of
     Committed Loans outstanding plus Competitive Loans outstanding
     plus Swingline Loans outstanding shall not at any time exceed
     the Revolving Credit Facility.  Each





<PAGE>





Competitive Loan shall be not less than $1,000,000 in the aggregate
and in integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof.

          (b)  Competitive Bid Requests.  The Borrower may solicit
     Competitive Bids by delivery of a Competitive Bid Request
     substantially in the form of Exhibit F to the Agent by 12:00
     noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a Business Day not
     less than three (3) nor more than ten (10) Business Days prior
     to the date of a requested Competitive Loan advance.  Each
     Competitive Bid Request (i) shall specify (A) the effective
     date of the requested Competitive Loan (which shall be a
     Business Day), (B) the amount of the requested Competitive Loan
     and (C) the applicable Interest Periods requested, and (ii)
     shall be accompanied by payment to the Agent for its own
     account of a fee of $1,500.  The Agent shall notify the Lenders
     of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Request and the contents
     thereof and invite the Lenders to submit Competitive Bids in

     no more than five (5) different Interest Periods at a time)
     shall be submitted at any one time.

          (c)  Competitive Bid Procedure.  Each Lender may, in its
     sole discretion, make one or more Competitive Bids to the
     Borrower in response to a Competitive Bid Request.  Each
     Competitive Bid must be received by the Agent not later than
     10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the proposed
     date of a Competitive Loan; provided, however, that should the
     Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, desire to submit a

     Bid and the terms thereof not later than 9:30 a.m. (Charlotte,
     North Carolina time) on the proposed date of a Competitive
     Loan.  A Lender may offer to make all or part of the requested
     Competitive Loan and may submit multiple Competitive Bids in
     response to a Competitive Bid Request.  The Competitive Bid
     shall specify (i) the particular Competitive Bid Request as to
     which the Competitive Bid is submitted, (ii) the minimum (which
     shall be not less than $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of
     $500,000 in excess thereof) and maximum principal amounts of
     the requested Competitive Loan or Loans which such Lender is
     willing to make, and (iii) the applicable interest rate or
     rates and Interest Period or Periods therefor.  A Competitive
     Bid submitted by a Lender in accordance with the provisions
     hereof shall be irrevocable.  The Agent shall promptly notify
     the Borrower of all Competitive Bids made and the terms
     thereof.  The Agent shall send a copy of each of the
     Competitive Bids to the Borrower for its records as soon as
     practicable.

Bid offered to it.  To accept a Competitive Bid, the Borrower shall
give written notification of its acceptance of any or all such
Competitive Bids to the Agent by 11:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North
Carolina time) on the proposed date of Competitive Loan; provided,
however, (i) the failure by the Borrower to give timely notice of
its acceptance of a Competitive Bid shall be deemed to be a refusal
thereof, (ii) the Borrower may accept Competitive Bids for a
particular Interest Period only in ascending order of rates, (iii)
the aggregate amount of Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower
shall not exceed the principal amount specified in the Competitive
Bid Request, (iv) if the Borrower shall accept a bid or bids made at
a particular Competitive Bid Rate, but the amount of such bid or
bids shall cause the total amount of bids to be accepted by the
Borrower to be in excess of the amount specified in the Competitive
Bid Request, then the Borrower shall accept a portion of such bid or
bids in an amount equal to the amount specified in the Competitive
Bid Request less the amount of all other Competitive Bids accepted
with respect to such Competitive Bid Request, which acceptance in
the case of multiple bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be
made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such bid at such
Competitive Bid Rate, and (v) no bid shall be accepted for a
Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum
principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in
excess thereof, except that where a portion of a Competitive Bid is
accepted in accordance with the provisions of clause (iv) of this
Section 2.8(d), then in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 and
integral multiples thereof (but not in any event less than the
minimum amount specified in the Competitive Bid), and in calculating
the pro rata allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple bids
at a particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) of this
Section 2.8(d), the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples
of $100,000 in a manner which shall be in the discretion of the
Borrower.  A notice of acceptance of a Competitive Bid given by the
Borrower in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be
irrevocable.  The Agent shall, not later than 12:00 noon (Charlotte,
North Carolina time) on the proposed date ofCompetitive Loan, notify
each bidding Lender whether or not its Competitive Bid has been
accepted (and if so, in what amount and at what Competitive Bid
Rate), and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound,
subject to the other applicable conditions hereof, to make the
Competitive Loan in respect of which its bid has been accepted.  In
addition, the Agent shall, upon the request of any Lender, provide
such Lender with information regarding the range of Competitive Bids
submitted by the Lenders in connection with any Competitive Bid
Request.

     by each Lender to the Borrower and the obligation of the
     Borrower to repay such Competitive Loans shall be evidenced by,

     order of such Lender.  Subject to the provisions of Section
     12.10, each such Competitive Loan Note shall be dated the
     Agreement Date and be duly and validly executed and delivered
     by the Borrower.

          (g)  Repayment of Competitive Loans.  The principal amount
     of each Competitive Loan shall be payable on the last day of
     the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided, however,
     unless the Borrower shall give notice to the Agent otherwise,
     the Borrower, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2, shall
     be deemed to have submitted a Notice of Borrowing as
     contemplated pursuant to Section 2.3(c), effective on the last
     day of such Interest Period, with respect to a Committed Loan
     comprised solely of Base Rate Advances in the amount of a

     promptly notify each Lender of such deemed Notice of Borrowing.

          (h)  Interest on Competitive Loans.  Subject to the
     provisions of Section 4.1, each Competitive Loan shall bear

     with reimbursement of drawings of Letters of Credit as
     contemplated by Section 3.3(b)) subject to satisfaction of the

     agree (subject to the terms of the definition of "Interest
     Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and to the terms of Section
     2.9(b)(iv)).

           (ii)     Minimum Amounts.  Each Swingline Loan shall be
     in a minimum principal amount mutually acceptable to the
     Swingline Lender and the Borrower.

          (iii)     Swingline Loan Note.  The Swingline Loans made
     by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower and the obligation of
     the Borrower to repay such Swingline Loans shall be evidenced
     by, and be repayable in accordance with the terms of, a single
     Swingline Loan Note, made by the Borrower payable to the order
     of the Swingline Lender.  The Swingline Loan Note shall be
     dated the Agreement Date and be duly and validly executed and
     delivered by the Borrower.

           (iv)     Repayment of Swingline Loans.  The principal
     amount of each Swingline Loan shall be payable on the earlier
     of (A) the maturity date agreed to by the Swingline Lender and
     the Borrower with respect to such Swingline Loan (which
     maturity date shall not be a date more than seven (7) Business
     Days from the date of advance thereof) or (B) the Termination
     Date; provided, however, that the Swingline Lender may, at any
     time, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Borrower
     and the Lenders, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans, and
     such demand shall be deemed to have been given one (1) Business
     Day prior to the Termination Date and on the date of the
     occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 10.1(g)
     or (h) and upon acceleration of the indebtedness hereunder and
     the exercise of remedies in accordance with the provisions of
     Section 10.2.  Any such demand (or deemed demand) for repayment
     of the Swingline Loans shall be deemed to constitute a Notice
     of Borrowing as contemplated pursuant to Section 2.3(d),
     effective on the date of such demand (or deemed demand), with
     respect to a Committed Loan comprised solely of Base Rate
     Advances in the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
     Swingline Loans.  The Agent, in turn, shall





<PAGE>





promptly notify each Lender of such deemed Notice of Borrowing.
Each Lender shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the Swingline
Lender's Domestic Lending Office or such other office as the
Swingline Lender may instruct, an amount equal to such Lender's
Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 10.2) of the
aggregate principal amount of all such outstanding Swingline Loans,
in immediately available funds, on the date demand for repayment of
the Swingline Loans is made (or deemed made as provided above) by
the Swingline Lender if notice of such demand (or deemed demand) is
given by the Swingline Lender to the Lenders at or prior to 12:00
noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) or, if notice of such demand
(or deemed demand) is given by the Swingline Lender to the Lenders
after 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time), then not later
than 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the next
Business Day, together with interest on such amount at the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for each day from and including the date of the
giving of notice of such demand (or deemed demand) by the Swingline
Lender to the Lenders to but excluding the date of payment by such
Lender.  If the applicable conditions to borrowing set forth in
Section 5.2 are satisfied, each such payment by a Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.9(b)(iv) shall constitute a Committed Advance which
is a Base Rate Advance by such Lender under the Revolving Credit
Facility as of the date of demand for repayment of the Swingline
Loans was made (or deemed made as provided above) by the Swingline
Lender, and each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its
Committed Advance of each Committed Loan in connection with any such
demand for repayment of the Swingline Loans by the Swingline Lender
in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified above
notwithstanding (I) the amount of such Committed Loan may not comply
with the minimum amount for Committed Loans otherwise required
hereunder or (II) failure of any such request or deemed request for
such Committed Loan to be made by the time otherwise required under
Section 2.3.  If the applicable conditions to borrowing set forth in
Section 5.2 are not satisfied, each such payment by a Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(iv) shall constitute the purchase of
participations by such Lender in the then outstanding Swingline
Loans; provided, however, that all interest payable on the Swingline
Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until the
date as of which any such participation is purchased.  Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to pay an amount equal
to its Commitment Percentage of the principal amount of all
outstanding Swingline Loans upon demand (or deemed demand) for
repayment thereof by the Swingline Lender as provided above shall at
all times and in all events be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable and in each case shall be made without counterclaim,
deduction or set-off by such Lender. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each









<PAGE>





Lender's obligation to pay its ratable share of the principal amount
of all outstanding Swingline Loans upon any demand (or deemed
demand) for repayment thereof by the Swingline Lender as provided
above shall not be affected by:

               (a)  any failure or inability of the Borrower to
          satisfy the applicable conditions to borrowing set forth
          in Section 5.2,

               (b)   any lack of validity or enforceability of this
          Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,

               (c)   the occurrence of any Default or Event of
          Default, or

               (d)  the Agent's failure to notify the Lenders of the
          issuance of any Letter of Credit.

     The Borrower hereby irrevocably instructs the Agent to disburse
     the proceeds of any Committed Advances or any payments for
     participations made as provided above in this Section
     2.9(b)(iv) to the Swingline Lender.  Proceeds of Committed
     Advances made pursuant this Section 2.9(b)(iv) shall be applied
     to the repayment of the Swingline Loans.

          (c)  Interest on Swingline Loans.  Subject to the
     provisions of Section 4.1, Swingline Loans shall bear interest
     at a per annum rate equal to, at the Borrower's election,
     either (i) a rate equal to the Variable CD Rate (which rate
     shall change contemporaneously with any change in the Variable
     CD Rate) plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) such other rate as
     may be quoted by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower in the
     sole discretion of the Swingline Lender and accepted by the
     Borrower at or promptly following the time of such quote.
     Interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable in arrears on each
     applicable Interest Payment Date.

     Section   Extension of Commitments.  The Borrower may request
that the Termination Date be extended for successive periods of one
year, by notice to the Agent given not later than 14 months (nor
earlier than 15 months) prior to the then effective Termination
Date.  The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of any such
request and, if such extension request is agreed to in writing by
all Lenders, will use reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower that
such extension has been approved not later than 13 months prior to
the then effective Termination Date.

                    LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY

     Section   Letters of Credit.  The Bank, subject to




<PAGE>





satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing set forth in Section
5.2, shall issue the Alabama Letter of Credit, and, in addition, any
Lender in its sole discretion may, with the consent of the Agent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, issue, at any time
after the Effective Date until the date five Business Days prior to
the Termination Date subject to satisfaction of the conditions to
borrowing set forth in Section 5.2, a Letter of Credit for the
account of the Borrower or a Subsidiary Guarantor, naming the
Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor as the account party, provided
that (i) the Letter of Credit Obligations at any time outstanding
shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Facility, (ii) the Letter of
Credit Obligations at any time outstanding with respect to all
Letters of Credit other than the Alabama Letter of Credit shall not
exceed $25,000,000, (iii) the sum of the principal amounts of
Committed Loans outstanding plus Competitive Loans outstanding plus
Swingline Loans outstanding shall not exceed at any time the
Revolving Credit Facility (in each case, after giving effect to
issuance of any requested Letter of Credit), and (iv) no Letter of
Credit shall have a stated expiration date later than the first to
occur of (x) the fifth Business Day prior to the Termination Date in
effect on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and (y)
except for the Alabama Letter of Credit, the first anniversary of
the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Each Application
shall provide for the unconditional obligation, without regard to
any defense or claim or counterclaim against the beneficiary of the
related Letter of Credit of the Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor the
account party thereon, to reimburse on demand the Issuer of such
Letter of Credit for any amount drawn under such Letter of Credit
and, in respect of standby Letters of Credit, for fees consistent
with Section 4.15(c).  The Borrower hereby agrees with each Issuer,
for its benefit and for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders,
that the Borrower shall be obligated to perform the reimbursement
and other payment Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor named as
the account party in any Letter of Credit, not as a guarantor or
surety, but as a primary obligor under the related Application to
the same extent as the Subsidiary Guarantor named therein.

     Section   Purchase and Sale of Participations.   Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, effective the date of
issuance of each Letter of Credit (or, as to each Existing Letter of
Credit, effective the Effective Date), the Issuer thereof hereby
sells to each Lender, and each Lender hereby purchases from such
Issuer, an undivided participating interest equal to its Commitment
Percentage in all of such Issuer's right, title and interest in and
to such Letter of Credit and such Issuer's obligations thereunder,
together with all of such Issuer's right, title and interest in and
to the related Application (but excluding certain fees and payments
referred to in Section 3.4).  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to pay an amount equal to its Commitment
Percentage of all draws under each Letter of Credit as hereinafter
provided shall at all times and in all events be absolute,
unconditional





<PAGE>





and irrevocable and in each case shall be made without counterclaim,
deduction or setoff by such Lender.  Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each Lender's obligation to pay its ratable share
of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to the Agent for the account
of the Issuer thereof shall not be affected by:

          (a)  any failure or inability of the Borrower to satisfy
     the applicable conditions to borrowing set forth in Section
     5.2,

          (b)  any lack of validity or enforceability of this
     Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,

          (c)  any draft, certificate or any other document
     presented under the Letter of Credit upon which payment has
     been made in good faith and according to its terms proving to
     be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect
     or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
     respect,

          (d)  the surrender or impairment of any collateral or any
     other security for the reimbursement obligation of the Borrower
     under such Letter of Credit,

          (e)  the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, or

          (f) the Agent's failure to notify the Lenders of the
     issuance of any Letter of Credit.

     Section   Unreimbursed Draws Under Letters of Credit.

          (a)  Each Issuer shall promptly notify the Agent upon the
     occurrence of any drawing under a Letter of Credit of the date
     and amount of such drawing, the remaining amount, if any,
     available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, and whether
     the amount of such drawing has been reimbursed to the Issuer by
     the Borrower or the Subsidiary Guarantor named as the account
     party therein.

          (b)  Each notice from an Issuer pursuant to subsection (a)
     above to the effect that a drawing has not been reimbursed in
     full shall constitute a request by the Borrower for a Swingline
     Loan from the Swingline Lender in the unreimbursed amount of
     such drawing, unless the sum of the unreimbursed amount of such
     drawing plus the principal amount of all outstanding Swingline
     Loans (prior to giving effect to a Swingline Loan relating to
     the unreimbursed amount of such drawing) exceeds the Swingline
     Facility.  Any Swingline Loan made in order to reimburse the
     Issuer for the unreimbursed amount of a drawing under any
     Letter of Credit as contemplated by this subsection (b) shall
     be on such terms as are mutually acceptable to the Swingline
     Lender and





<PAGE>





the Borrower and shall be subject to all other terms, conditions and
limitations set forth in Section 2.9, including, without limitation,
satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing set forth in Section
5.2.

          (c)  (i) If the unreimbursed amount of a drawing under any
     Letter of Credit is not, for any reason, reimbursed to the
     Issuer with proceeds of a Swingline Loan pursuant to subsection
     (b) above, each notice pursuant to subsection (a) above from an
     Issuer to the effect that a drawing has not been reimbursed in
     full shall constitute a Notice of Borrowing as contemplated
     pursuant to Section 2.3(b) with respect to a Committed Loan
     comprised solely of Base Rate Advances in the unreimbursed
     amount of such drawing.  The Agent, in turn, shall promptly
     notify each Lender of its receipt of such deemed Notice of
     Borrowing.

          (ii) Each Lender shall pay to the Agent, for the account
     of such Issuer's Domestic Lending Office or such other office
     as such Issuer may instruct, an amount equal to such Lender's
     Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
     termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 10.2) of
     such unreimbursed drawing, in immediately available funds, on
     the date notice is given by the Agent if such notice is given
     at or prior to 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) or,
     if notice is given after 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North Carolina
     time), then not later than 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North
     Carolina time) on the next succeeding Business Day, together
     with interest on such amount at the Federal Funds Effective
     Rate for each day from and including the date of such drawing
     to but excluding the date of payment by such Lender.

          (iii)  (A) If the applicable conditions to borrowing set
     forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied, each such payment by a
     Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(c)(ii) shall constitute a
     Committed Advance which is a Base Rate Advance by such Lender
     under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date the
     unreimbursed drawing was paid by the Issuer, or

          (B)  if the applicable conditions to borrowing set forth
     in Section 5.2 are not satisfied, each such payment pursuant to
     Section 3.3(c)(ii) shall constitute Obligations, payable on
     demand by the Borrower, and shall bear interest at the rate set
     forth in Section 4.1 from the date on which the unreimbursed
     drawing was paid by the Issuer until such Obligations are paid
     in full.


          (d)  The Borrower hereby irrevocably instructs the Agent
     to disburse the proceeds of any Swingline Loans, Committed
     Advances or payments made pursuant to subsections (b) or (c),
     as the case may be, to the applicable Issuer, on behalf of the
     Borrower, to be applied to the reimbursement




<PAGE>





obligation under the related Letter of Credit and Application, but
only the making of Swingline Loans or Committed Advances shall be
deemed to satisfy the Borrower's reimbursement obligation to the
Issuer under such Letter of Credit and Application; provided, that
the Issuer's rights and remedies in respect of any collateral for
the Borrower's Obligations under the Application shall remain
unaffected by any payments under Section 3.3(c)(ii) that are subject
to Section 3.3(c)(iii)(B), subject to the requirements of Section
3.4; and provided, further, that any amounts paid to the Agent for
the account of the Lenders for application to demand Obligations
arising pursuant to Section 3.3(c)(iii)(B) shall also reduce,
dollar-for-dollar, any claim for reimbursement by the Issuer of such
Letter of Credit under the Application.

     Section   Sharing of Payments and Risk.

          (a)  Each Issuer shall remit to the Agent, for the ratable
     account of the Lenders for application to the Obligations (and,
     if applicable, specifically for application to the demand
     Obligations arising under Section 3.3(c)(iii)(B)) all monies
     received by such Issuer as payments under or proceeds of
     collateral securing any Application or Letter of Credit, other
     than (x) documentation, negotiation, cable, amendment and other
     similar fees and charges, if any, customarily imposed by such
     Issuer in connection with the issuance of similar letters of
     credit and (y) the portion of any standby Letter of Credit fee
     expressly provided in Section 4.15(c) to be retained by the
     Issuer; provided, however, that the Issuer may receive and
     retain any amounts paid to it by or on behalf of the Borrower
     or the named account party in reimbursement of drawings under a
     Letter of Credit if and to the extent that no payments under
     Section 3.3(b) or (c)(ii) have been made by the Lenders in
     respect of such reimbursement obligation prior to the receipt
     thereof by the Issuer.  Such monies shall include, without
     limitation, but subject to the preceding sentence, fees paid by
     the Borrower or the named account party under an Application
     for a standby Letter of Credit and payments by the Borrower or
     the named account party to the Issuer in reimbursement for
     drafts or drawings paid by such Issuer under a Letter of
     Credit, and shall be remitted by the Issuer in the same type of
     funds received by the Issuer, on the day of the Issuer's
     receipt thereof if received on or prior to 12:00 noon
     (Charlotte, North Carolina time) or, if received after 12:00
     noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time), then not later than
     12:00 noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the next
     succeeding Business Day.
          (b)  Each Lender shall share ratably in all risks
     associated with any Applications and Letters of Credit
     (including, without limitation, the risk that any fee








<PAGE>





associated with a Letter of Credit is not paid when due) to the
extent of its participation hereunder.  An Issuer shall have no
obligation to pay any Lender such Lender's share of any payments
under or relating to an Application or Letter of Credit until such
Issuer actually receives payment thereof.  At the time an Issuer
receives any funds for application to payment of any amounts (other
than the fees specified above payable to the Issuer only or amounts
in reimbursement of drawings in respect of which no payments under
Section 3.3(b) or (c)(ii) have been made) under or relating to such
Application or Letter of Credit, whether through payment by the
Borrower, from any other obligor thereunder, offset, counterclaim or
otherwise (but excluding payments made by the Lenders), such Issuer
will pay to the Agent, for the ratable account of the Lenders, such
amount in the same type of funds received by the Issuer.  If an
Issuer is ever required for any reason to refund any such payment,
each Lender agrees to refund to the Agent, for the account of such
Issuer, promptly upon such Issuer's request, such Lender's ratable
share of such payment, together with such Lender's ratable share of
interest or penalties, if any, payable by the Issuer in connection
with the refund made by the Issuer.  In the event that an Issuer is
not reimbursed by the Borrower in respect of any drawing under a
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuer and with regard to which it
has been determined by a final, unappealable decision of a court
having jurisdiction in the matter that the Borrower is not required
to reimburse the Issuer, then the Issuer shall refund to each Lender
any amount previously paid by such Lender to the Issuer with respect
to such unreimbursed drawing.

     Section   Administration of Letters of Credit and
Credit Documents.  As between each Issuer, the Lenders and the
Agent:

          (a)   (i) After the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no
     Issuer will reduce any principal, interest or fees reimbursable
     or payable under the related Application or postpone any date
     fixed for the payment of such principal, interest or fees
     without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders and no
     Issuer will increase the Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit
     without the consent of the Agent, which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld, and

          (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 3.5(a)(i), an
     Issuer may change, modify, waive or amend the terms of any
     Letter of Credit or Application so long as such Letter of
     Credit or Application, as amended, complies with the
     requirements of Section 3.1; provided, however, that if any
     Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing, no Issuer will, without the prior written consent
     of all of the Lenders, change, modify, waive or amend the terms
     of any Letter of Credit or Application, except (A) to the
     extent to which such Issuer is






<PAGE>





specifically required to do so by the terms thereof, or (B) to waive
immaterial nonconformity of documents presented as a condition to
draws.

          (b)  An Issuer shall have no duty (i) to exercise any
     right, power, remedy or privilege granted to it under or
     relating to a Letter of Credit or Application, (ii) to
     ascertain whether any default under such Application has
     occurred and is continuing or otherwise to inquire into the
     performance or observance on the part of the Borrower or named
     account party of any term, covenant, condition or agreement to
     be performed or observed by it, or (iii) to take or not to take
     any action under or relating to a Letter of Credit or
     Application (other than as specifically required to do so by
     the terms thereof).

          (c)  An Issuer shall not be obligated (i) to extend or
     otherwise amend or modify a Letter of Credit (except to the
     extent such Issuer is specifically required to do so by the
     terms thereof) or any payment terms relating to any principal,
     interest or fees reimbursable under an Application; or (ii) to
     execute any amendment or modification of a Letter of Credit or
     Application to the extent such amendment or modification would
     have an adverse effect on the Issuer.

          (d)  Each Issuer will notify the Agent promptly of its
     issuance of each approved Letter of Credit, including the named
     account party, Stated Amount, expiration date, name of the
     beneficiary, and type (whether standby or documentary) of such
     Letter of Credit, and the Agent will notify all Lenders not
     less frequently than quarterly of the Letters of Credit
     outstanding from time to time.

     Section   Exoneration.

          (a)  It is understood and agreed that each Lender has made
     and shall continue to make its own credit determinations and
     analyses to enter into the transactions contemplated hereby
     based upon such information as such Lender may deem sufficient
     and not based on any statements or representations by an Issuer
     or the Agent.  It is understood and agreed that the sales of
     participations to the Lenders in Letters of Credit and related
     Applications, collateral and other Obligations are made without
     recourse to any Issuer and that no Issuer makes any
     representation or warranty of any kind to any Lender and shall
     not be responsible to any Lender for (i) the due execution,
     legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
     collectability of any Application, (ii) any representation,
     warranty or statement made in or in connection with any
     Application, (iii) the financial condition or creditworthiness
     of the Borrower or any named account party, (iv) the
     performance of or compliance with





<PAGE>





any of the terms or provisions of any Application on the part of the
Borrower or any named account party or of any Letter of Credit on
the part of the beneficiary thereof, or (v) inspecting any of the
property, books or records of the Borrower or any named account
party.

          (b)  No Issuer nor any of its officers, directors,
     employees, agents or attorneys shall be liable for any mistake,
     error of judgment or action taken or omitted to be taken in
     connection with a Letter of Credit or an Application, except
     for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
     An Issuer may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for
     the Borrower, the named account party, if different, and the
     beneficiary under the applicable Letter of Credit), independent
     public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall
     not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
     (x) in accordance with the advice of its counsel or (y) except
     as may be otherwise provided in the Letter of Credit or related
     Application, in connection with the applicable Letter of Credit
     or Application pursuant to any notice, consent, certificate or
     other writing received by such Issuer and believed by it in
     good faith to be genuine.  An Issuer shall incur no liability
     under or in respect of an Application or Letter of Credit or
     any document relating thereto, to any other Lender or, except
     as may be otherwise provided in the Letter of Credit or related
     Application, to the Borrower or other named account party, by
     acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other
     instrument or writing (which may be by facsimile, telegram,
     cable or telex) believed by it in good faith to have been
     delivered or made by an authorized Person.  An Issuer and its
     subsidiaries and affiliates may engage in any kind of banking
     or trust business with any obligor under an Application without
     liability or obligation to account to the Lenders therefor,
     except as set forth herein.

     Section   Cash Collateral; Supporting Letters of Credit. If,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1, any Letter of Credit
is outstanding when this Agreement is terminated (including, without
limitation, any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section
10.2) or when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then on or prior to such Termination Date or on demand
by the Agent after the occurrence and during the continuation of
such Event of Default, the Borrower shall deposit with the Agent,
for the benefit of the Issuer and for the ratable benefit of the
Lenders, with respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding,
Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the sum of the Stated Amount
of such Letter of Credit, plus the amount of any unreimbursed
drawings thereunder, plus the amount of any fees, charges, and other
amounts which may become payable to such Issuer under such Letter of
Credit or the related Application for application to the
reimbursement and other Obligations of the Borrower thereunder.  The
Borrower may,





<PAGE>





so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in
lieu of making such deposit of Cash Collateral with respect to any
such Letter of Credit, arrange for the issuance of a standby letter
of credit, naming the Issuer of such Letter of Credit as the
beneficiary, and otherwise in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such Issuer, or make such other arrangements with
such Issuer as shall, in any event, cause such Issuer to repurchase
from each Lender such Lender's participation in such Letter of
Credit and release the Agent and each Lender from any and all
obligation in respect of such Letter of Credit, by a written
instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Agent and each Lender, and cause such instrument to be delivered to
the Agent and each Lender, duly executed by such Issuer.  At the
Borrower's request, but subject to the Agent's reasonable approval,
the Agent shall invest any Cash Collateral consisting of cash or any
proceeds of Cash Collateral consisting of cash in Permitted
Investments of the types described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of
paragraph (a) of the definition thereof, and any commissions,
reasonable expenses and penalties reasonably incurred by the Agent
in connection with any investment and redemption of such Cash
Collateral shall be Obligations and may be paid out of the proceeds
of any earnings received by the Agent from the investment of such
Cash Collateral or out of such cash itself.  The Agent makes no
representation or warranty as to, and shall not be responsible for,
the rate of return, if any, earned on any investment of any Cash
Collateral. Any earnings on such Cash Collateral shall be held as
additional Cash Collateral on the terms set forth in this Section
3.7.  If, after all Letters of Credit outstanding on the Termination
Date have expired and all reimbursement Obligations of the Borrower
thereunder and under the related Applications have been paid in
full, any other Obligations remain unpaid, any remaining Cash
Collateral may be applied to pay such Obligations in such order as
the Agent may determine, and any Cash Collateral remaining after the
indefeasible payment in full of all Obligations shall promptly be
paid to the Borrower or to whomever may be legally entitled thereto.

<PAGE>





in all other cases, 2% above the rate then applicable to Base Rate
Advances.

     Section   Conversion/Continuation.  Provided that no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower
may convert or continue all or any part (subject to the restrictions
applicable to Committed Loans comprised of each Type of Committed
Advance as set forth in Section 2.1 and to the provisions of
Sections 2.4 and 4.5) of any outstanding Committed Loan comprised of
Committed Advances of one Type (a) into a Committed Loan or
Committed Loans comprised of Committed Advances of any other Type
provided for in this Agreement or (b) as a Committed Loan or
Committed Loans comprised of Committed Advances of the same Type, in
the same aggregate principal amount, on any Business Day (which, in
the case of a conversion or continuation of a Committed Loan
comprised of Eurodollar Advances, shall be the last day of the
Interest Period applicable to such Committed Advances), upon notice
(which notice shall be irrevocable) given in accordance with Section
2.3(e). Competitive Loans and Swingline Loans may not be converted
or continued.

     Section   Reduction of Commitments.

          (a)  Voluntary Reductions.  The Borrower shall have the
     right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent,
     to terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in part the
     unused portions of the Commitments of the Lenders, provided
     that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of
     $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
     thereof.  The Agent shall promptly notify each of the Lenders
     of its receipt of any notice pursuant to this Section 4.3(a).

          (b)  Mandatory Reductions.

          (i)  The Commitments of the Lenders automatically shall be
     reduced ratably on the first to occur of (A) the date that the
     Alabama Letter of Credit is fully drawn, (B) the expiration
     date of the Alabama Letter of Credit and (C) the date that the
     Alabama Letter of Credit is returned to the Bank for
     cancellation, such reduction to be in an amount (rounded
     downwards, if necessary, to the nearest whole multiple of
     $500,000) equal to the undrawn amount of the Alabama Letter of
     Credit as of such date.

          (ii) The Commitments of the Lenders automatically shall be
     reduced ratably by an amount equal to the amount of any
     prepayment of principal of the Committed Loans made pursuant to
     Section 4.4(a)(ii).


     Section   Prepayments.






<PAGE>





          (a)  Mandatory.

            (i) If at any time the sum of the principal amounts of
     Committed Loans outstanding plus Competitive Loans outstanding
     plus Swingline Loans outstanding shall exceed the Revolving
     Credit Facility, then the Borrower shall prepay so much of the
     Loans as shall be necessary to eliminate such excess, together
     with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount
     prepaid to the date of prepayment.

           (ii) If at any time on or after the Agreement Date the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive Net
     Disposition Proceeds (other than in connection with the sale by
     the Borrower prior to the Agreement Date of the Harper Brothers
     Business Unit) which in the aggregate exceed $25,000,000, then
     the Borrower shall promptly prepay the Loans by an amount equal
     to such excess, together with accrued and unpaid interest on
     the principal amount prepaid to the date of prepayment.

          (iii) Amounts prepaid pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii)
     above shall be applied first to the Swingline Loans (first to
     Swingline Loans bearing interest at a rate based on the
     Variable CD Rate and then to Swingline Loans bearing interest
     at a fixed rate (in chronological order of the occurrence of
     the last days of the Interest Periods applicable thereto)),
     second to the Committed Loans (first to Base Rate Advances and
     then to Eurodollar Advances (in chronological order of the
     occurrence of the last days of the Interest Periods applicable
     thereto)) and third to the Competitive Loans (in chronological
     order of the occurrence of the last days of the Interest
     Periods applicable thereto).

          (b)  Optional.

            (i) The principal amount of each Committed Loan
     comprised of Base Rate Advances may be prepaid, in whole or
     from time to time in part, together with accrued and unpaid
     interest on the principal amount prepaid to the date of
     prepayment, by the Borrower, at any time, without premium or
     penalty, on not less than one Business Day's prior notice to
     the Agent specifying the Committed Loan to be prepaid, the date
     of prepayment and the principal amount to be prepaid, and if
     such notice is given, such prepayment shall be made on the date
     specified in such notice.  The Agent shall promptly notify each
     of the Lenders of its receipt of any notice pursuant to this
     Section 4.4(b)(i).  The principal amount of each Committed Loan
     comprised of Eurodollar Advances may be prepaid, in whole or in
     part by the Borrower, without premium or penalty, on the last
     day of the Interest Period applicable to such Committed
     Advances, upon notless than three Business Day's notice, to the
     Agent,






<PAGE>





specifying the Committed Loan to be prepaid, the last day of the
Interest Period applicable to the Committed Advances comprising such
Committed Loan and the principal amount to be prepaid, and if such
notice is given, such prepayment shall be made on the last day of
the Interest Period specified in such notice.  Amounts prepaid on
the Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 4.4(b)(i) may be
reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

           (ii) The principal amount of each Swingline Loan bearing
     interest at a rate based on the Variable CD Rate may be
     prepaid, in whole or from time to time in part, together with
     accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount prepaid to
     the date of prepayment, by the Borrower, at any time, without
     premium or penalty, on not less than one Business Day's prior
     notice to the Agent specifying the Swingline Loan to be
     prepaid, the date of prepayment and the principal amount to be
     prepaid, and if such notice is given, such prepayment shall be
     made on the date specified in such notice.  Except as otherwise
     provided in Section 2.9(b)(iv) and Section 4.4(a), Swingline
     Loans bearing interest at a fixed rate may not be prepaid.
     Amounts prepaid on the Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section
     4.4(b)(ii) may be reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
     hereof.

          (iii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.4(a),
     Competitive Loans may not be prepaid.

     Section   Changed Circumstances.

          (a)  If the introduction of or any change in or in the
     interpretation of (in each case, after the date hereof) any law
     or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
     governmental authority asserts, after the date hereof, that it
     is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to
     perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Advances
     or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Advances hereunder, the Agent
     shall notify the Borrower of such event and the right of the
     Borrower to select Eurodollar Advances for any subsequent
     Committed Loan or in connection with any subsequent conversion
     of any Committed Loan shall be suspended until such Lender
     shall notify the Agent that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist or such Lender shall cease to be a
     party hereto, and the Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full
     all Eurodollar Advances then outstanding, with interest accrued
     thereon, unless the Borrower, within three Business Days of
     such notice from the Agent, requests the conversion of all
     Eurodollar Advances then outstanding into Base Rate Advances in
     accordance with Sections 2.3(e) and 4.2; provided, that if the
     date of such repayment or proposed conversion is not the last
     day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar
     Advances, the Borrower shall also pay any amount due pursuant
     to Section 4.8.





<PAGE>






          (b)  If the Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business
     Day before the date of any requested Committed Loan or the date
     of any conversion or continuation of any existing Committed
     Loan (each such Committed Loan requested to be made, or as such
     Committed Loan is to be converted or continued, a "Pending
     Committed Loan"), notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for
     Eurodollar Advances comprising such Pending Committed Loan will
     not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of
     making or funding their respective Eurodollar Advances, as the
     case may be, for such Pending Committed Loan, the right of the
     Borrower to select Eurodollar Advances for such Pending
     Committed Loan, any subsequent Committed Loan or in connection
     with any subsequent conversion or continuation of any Committed
     Loan shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
     Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist, and each Committed Advance
     comprising each Pending Committed Loan and each such subsequent
     Committed Loan requested to be made, continued or converted
     shall be made or continued as, or converted into, a Base Rate
     Advance or, upon notice given in accordance with Section 2.3(a)
     or 2.3(e), as applicable, a Committed Advance of the Type, if
     any, as to which the Majority Lenders shall not have given the
     notice provided in this subparagraph (b).

          (c)  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any
     change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase
     of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Reserve
     Percentage) in or in the interpretation of, in each case after
     the date hereof, any law or regulation (except to the extent
     such introduction, change or interpretation affects taxes
     measured by net income) or (ii) the compliance with any
     guideline or request (except to the extent such guideline or
     request affects taxes measured by net income) from any central
     bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the
     force of law) made after the date hereof, there shall be any
     increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or
     making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Advances (other than
     as separately provided for in Section 4.5(d)), then the
     Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender
     (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for
     the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
     compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, that
     no Lender shall be entitled to demand, nor shall the Borrower
     be obligated to pay, any such amount attributable to a period
     more than 90 days prior to the date of such demand.

          (d)  If (x) the adoption of or change in, after the date
     hereof, any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding
     capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or
     any change, after the date hereof, in the interpretation or
     application thereof by any governmental





<PAGE>





authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof,
or (y) compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or
directive, made or promulgated after the date hereof, of any such
entity regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force
of law), has the effect of reducing the return on a Lender's capital
as a consequence of its Commitments hereunder, its maintaining its
Committed Advances or other Loans hereunder, or its obligations
pursuant to Article 3 in respect of Letters of Credit, to a level
below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such
Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy immediately
before such adoption, change or compliance and assuming the full
utilization of such Lender's capital immediately before such
adoption, change or compliance) by any amount deemed by such Lender
to be material, then such Lender shall promptly after its
determination of such occurrence notify the Borrower and the Agent
thereof.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account
of such Lender, as an additional fee from time to time, on demand by
such Lender, such amount as such Lender certifies to be the amount
that will compensate it for such reduction in connection with its
Commitments hereunder or its obligations pursuant to Article 3 in
respect of Letters of Credit; provided, that no Lender shall be
entitled to demand, nor shall the Borrower be obligated to pay, any
such amount attributable to a period more than 90 days prior to the
date of such demand.

          (e)  Before giving any notice pursuant to Section 4.5(a)
     or making any demand pursuant to Section 4.5(c) or (d) each
     Lender agrees to use its best efforts (consistent with its
     internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
     designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making
     of such a designation would avoid the need for such notice or
     demand, or reduce the amount of such increased cost or
     reduction in return and would not, in the reasonable judgment
     of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

          (f)  A certificate of the Lender claiming compensation
     under Section 4.5(c) or (d) shall be conclusive in the absence
     of manifest error.  Such certificate shall set forth the nature
     of the occurrence giving rise to such compensation, the
     additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the
     method by which such amounts were determined.  In determining
     such amount, a Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
     attribution methods.

     Section   Interest Rate Determination.

          (a)  Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Agent
     timely information for the purpose of determining each
     Eurodollar Rate, as applicable.  If any one or more of the







<PAGE>





Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the
Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the
Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely
information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks; provided,
however, that if fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely
information to the Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for
Eurodollar Advances comprising any Committed Loan requested or as to
which a Notice of Conversion/Continuation has been given, the right
of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Advances for such Committed
Loan or for any subsequent Committed Loan or to request any
subsequent conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Advances
comprising any Committed Loan shall be suspended until the Agent
shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Eurodollar Advance
comprising any such Committed Loan shall be or become a Base Rate
Advance.

          (b)  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower
     and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by
     the Agent for purposes of Section 2.6, and the applicable rate,
     if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
     determining the applicable interest rate under Section
     2.6(b)(i).

     Section   Manner of Payment.

          (a)  Each payment (including prepayments) by the Borrower
     on account of the principal of or interest on any Loans or of
     any other of the Obligations payable to the Agent or to the
     Agent for the account of any or all Lenders under this
     Agreement or any Note shall be made not later than 10:00 a.m.
     (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date specified for
     payment under this Agreement to the Agent at the Agent's
     Office, in Dollars, in immediately available funds, and shall
     be made without any setoff, counterclaim or deduction
     whatsoever.  The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any
     payment under this Agreement or any Note, specify to the Agent
     the Loans or other Obligations to which such payment is to be
     applied (and in the event it fails so to specify, or if an
     Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may
     distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the
     Majority Lenders or, failing receipt by the Agent of
     instructions from the Majority Lenders, the Agent may determine
     to be appropriate, subject to the provisions of Section 4.11
     hereof).  Any payment received after such time but before 2:00
     p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on such day shall be
     deemed a payment on such date for the purposes of Section 10.1,
     but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have been made on
     the next succeeding Business Day.

          (b)  The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent,
     each Lender and each Affiliate of each Lender to





<PAGE>





charge any account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent, such
Lender or Affiliate with such amounts (whether in U.S. Dollars or
the equivalent in other currencies) as may be necessary from time to
time to pay any Obligations (whether or not owed to the Agent or
such Lender) which are not paid when due.

     Section   Payments Not at End of Interest Period; Failure to
Borrow.  If for any reason:

               (i)  any payment of principal with respect to any
          Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Loan of any Lender or
          any Swingline Loan bearing interest at a fixed rate is
          made on any day other than the last day of the Interest
          Period applicable thereto, or,

               (ii) after (A) having given a Notice of Borrowing
          pursuant to Section 2.3(a) with respect to any Committed
          Loan to be comprised of Eurodollar Advances, (B) having
          accepted a Competitive Bid pursuant to Section 2.8(d) with
          respect to any Competitive Loan or (C) having given a
          notice of borrowing pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(i) with
          respect to any Swingline Loan bearing interest at a fixed
          rate, such Committed Loan, Competitive Loan or Swingline
          Loan, as the case may be, is not made due to the
          Borrower's failure to fulfill the applicable conditions
          set forth in Article 5,

then the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the account of each
affected Lender, an amount computed pursuant to the following
formula:

                       L = (R - T) x P x D
                               360

     L =  amount payable to such Lender
     R =  interest rate for the applicable Eurodollar Advance,
          Competitive Loan or Swingline Loan
     T =  effective interest rate per annum at which any readily
          marketable bonds or other obligations of the United
          States, selected at the Agent's reasonable discretion,
          maturing on or near the last day of the then applicable or
          requested Interest Period for the applicable Eurodollar
          Advance, Competitive Loan or Swingline Loan and in
          approximately the same amount as the applicable Eurodollar
          Advance, Competitive Loan or Swingline Loan, can be
          purchased by the Agent on the day of such payment of
          principal or failure to borrow
     P =  the amount of principal paid or the amount of the
          requested Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Loan or
          Swingline Loan
     D =  the number of days remaining in the Interest Period as of
          the date of such payment or the number of days in the
          requested Interest Period




<PAGE>






The Borrower shall pay such amount upon presentation by the Agent of
a statement setting forth the amount and the Agent's calculation
thereof pursuant hereto, which statement shall be deemed true and
correct absent manifest error.
     Section   Computation of Interest and Fees.  Interest and fees
payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. If any payment
required by this Agreement becomes due on a day that is not a
Business Day such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension shall be included in computing
payments of interest (at the rate applicable on such due date) or
facility fee, as the case may be, provided, that if the due date for
any payment of principal of any of the Obligations is extended by
operation of law, interest shall be payable on such amount of
principal for the period of such extension, at the applicable rate
set forth in Section 4.1, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
but in no event at a rate less than the rate applicable to such
Obligations on the original due date.  Interest shall accrue from
and include the date of advance, but exclude the date of payment.

     Section   Termination of Agreement.  The Borrower shall have
the right, at any time, to terminate this Agreement upon not less
than three Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, which
notice shall specify the effective date of such termination.  On the
date specified in such notice, such termination shall be effected,
provided, that the Borrower shall, on or prior to such date, (a) pay
to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, in immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount
of all Loans, together with (i) accrued interest thereon, (ii)
accrued fees payable pursuant to Section 4.15(b) from the date such
fees were last paid through the effective date of termination, (iii)
any amounts payable pursuant to Section 12.2 or 12.13, (iv) any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.5 or 4.8 and (v) any and all
other amounts owing to the Agent or any Lender under this Agreement
or any Note, and (b) satisfy its Obligations under Section 3.7.

     Section   Ratable Treatment.  Each Committed Loan, all payments
in respect of participations pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iv) and all
payments pursuant to Section 3.3(c)(ii) shall be made ratably by the
Lenders on the basis of their respective Commitments.  Each
repayment or prepayment of principal and each payment of interest on
each Committed Loan or any Obligations in which the Lenders have
purchased ratable participations pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iv) or
Section 3.3(c)(iii)(B) and each payment of fees pursuant to Section
4.15(a) or 4.15(b) shall be made to the Agent for the account of the
Lenders, in immediately available funds, and shall be distributed by
the Agent to the Lenders in like funds ratably (other than amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii), 4.5(c), 4.5(d) or 4.8) for
the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and each







<PAGE>





payment of any other amount payable to any Lender hereunder or under
the Notes or to any Issuer hereunder, shall be made to the Agent in
immediately available funds and shall be distributed by the Agent,
in like funds, to such Lender for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office or to such Issuer, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  With respect to
Competitive Loans, if the Borrower fails to specify the particular
Competitive Loan or Loans as to which any payment or other amount
should be applied and it is not otherwise clear as to the particular
Competitive Loan or Loans to which such payment or other amounts
relate, or any such payment or other amount is to be applied to
Competitive Loans without regard to any such direction by the
Borrower, then each payment or prepayment of principal on
Competitive Loans and each payment of interest or other amount on or
in respect of Competitive Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among
the relevant Lenders in accordance with the then outstanding amounts
of their respective Competitive Loans.

     Section   Sharing of Payments, etc.  If any Lender shall obtain
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of setoff, receipt of payment under any Subsidiary
Guaranty, or otherwise) on account of the Obligations owing to it
(other than pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii), 4.5(c), 4.5(d) or 4.8)
in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the
Obligations obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith
purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the
Obligations owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such
purchases shall be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price received by it to the
extent of its Commitment Percentage of such recovery together with
an amount equal to such other Lender's ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment
to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing
Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another
Lender pursuant to this Section 4.12 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including any
right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.  Nothing contained in this Section 4.12 shall
or shall be deemed (A) to prevent any Issuer from receiving monies
from the Borrower or a Subsidiary Guarantor and applying such monies
to the Borrower's outstanding reimbursement obligation under any
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuer and in respect of which no
Swingline Loan pursuant to Section 3.3(b) and no Committed Loan or
other payment by the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3(c)(ii) has been
made or (B) to prevent the Swingline Lender from receiving monies
from the Borrower or a Subsidiary





<PAGE>





Guarantor and applying such monies to the Borrower's outstanding
Swingline Loans in respect of which no Committed Loan or other
payment by the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iv) has been made.

     Section   U.S. Taxes.  (a)  The Borrower agrees to pay to each
Lender that is not a U.S. Person (a "Foreign Lender") such

     fee on the average daily amount of each Lender's Commitment
     (whether used or unused) from (a) the Effective Date in the
     case of each Lender a party hereto on such date and (b) the
     effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance
     pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other
     Lender, until the Termination Date at the rate of 0.25% per

remit to the Agent, for the ratable account of the Lenders (net of
such Issuer's Commitment Percentage thereof), the excess of such fee
over 0.125% per annum on the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit
for the applicable period; provided, however, the Lenders shall not
be entitled to any such fee in respect of a standby Letter of Credit
which is an Existing Letter of Credit if such fee has been deemed to
be earned during the period prior to the Effective Date (it being
understood and agreed by each of the Lenders that any such fee in
respect of a standby Letter ofCredit which is an Existing Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to be earned evenly throughout the period for
which it is paid regardless of when it was paid).

          (d)  Agent Fee.  In connection with and in consideration
     of the ongoing administration of the Facility, the Borrower
     shall pay to the Agent for its account alone, a fee in
     accordance with the terms of a separate letter agreement
     between the Borrower and the Agent.

          (l)  Tax Returns and Payments.  All material federal,
     state and other tax returns of each of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries required by law to be filed have been duly filed,
     and all material federal, state and other taxes, assessments
     and other governmental charges or levies upon the Borrower or
     its Subsidiaries and their property, income, profits and assets
     which are due and payable have been paid, except any such
     nonpayment which is at the time permitted under Section 7.6.
     The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of each of the
     Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries in respect of federal and
     state taxes are in the judgment of the Borrower, and in
     accordance with GAAP, adequate, and the Borrower knows of no
     reason to anticipate any additional assessments which, singly
     or in the aggregate, might have a Materially Adverse Effect on
     the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (m)   Burdensome Provisions.  Neither the Borrower nor any
     Subsidiary is a party to any indenture, agreement, lease
     orother instrument, or subject to any charter or corporate
     restriction, Governmental Approval or Applicable Law,
     compliance with the terms of which might have a Materially
     Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole, nor, except to the extent permitted pursuant to Section
     9.13, is the Borrower or any Subsidiary subject to any
     contractual restrictions which limit the amount of dividends
     payable by any Subsidiary.

          (n)   Financial Statements. The Borrower has furnished to
     the Lenders and the Agent copies of the Consolidated balance
     sheet of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at
     April 2, 1994 and of the related Consolidated statements of
     income and cash flow for the portion of the 1994 Fiscal Year
     ended on such date.  Such Consolidated financial statements are
     complete and correct in all material respects, and present
     fairly in accordance with GAAP the Consolidated financial
     position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as
     at their date and the results of operations of the Borrower and
     its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the portion of the Fiscal
     Year ended on such date.  Except as disclosed or reflected in
     such balance sheet or the notes relating thereto as at such
     date, and except as disclosed in writing to the Lenders and the
     Agent prior to the Agreement Date, as of the Effective Date the
     Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries have no material
     liabilities, contingent or otherwise, and there are no material
     unrealized or anticipated losses of the Borrower or its
     Consolidated Subsidiaries.

          (o)  Adverse Change.  Since the date of the latest annual
     or quarterly financial statements received by the Agent and the
     Lenders pursuant to Section 8.1 (or, prior to receipt by the
     Agent and the Lenders of the first financial





<PAGE>





statements pursuant to Section 8.1 since the date of the financial
statements described in Section 6.1(n)),

                (i) no material adverse change in the business,
          assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
          operations or business prospects of the Borrower and its
          Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has occurred, and

               (ii) no event has occurred or failed to occur which
          has had, or is likely to have, a Materially Adverse Effect
          on the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (p)   ERISA.  Schedule 6.1(p) is a complete and correct
     listing of all Plans of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
     effect on the Agreement Date.  Each Plan of the Borrower and
     its Subsidiaries is in compliance with ERISA in all material
     respects.  No material liability to the PBGC or to a Multi-
     employer Plan has been, or is expected by the Borrower or any
     Subsidiary to be, incurred by the Borrower or such Subsidiary.
          (q)   Absence of Defaults.  Neither the Borrower nor any
     Subsidiary is in default under its articles of incorporation or
     certificate of incorporation or by-laws and no event has
     occurred, which has not been remedied, cured or waived,

                (i) which constitutes a Default or an Event of
          Default, or

               (ii) which constitutes, or which with the passage of
          time or giving of notice or both would constitute, a
          default or event of default by the Borrower or any
          Subsidiary under any material agreement (other than this
          Agreement) or judgment, decree or order to which the
          Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the
          Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
          properties may be bound, except, in the case only of any
          such agreement, for alleged defaults which are being
          contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
          with respect to which adequate reserves where a reserve is
          appropriate in accordance with GAAP have been established
          on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the
          case may be, and except for defaults that have been
          disclosed and consented to by the Majority Lenders.

          (r)  Accuracy and Completeness of Information.  All
     written information, reports and other papers and data
     furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the
     Agent or any Lender, were or will be, at the time the same were
     or are so furnished, complete and correct in all material
     respects, to the extent necessary to give the








<PAGE>





recipient a true and accurate knowledge of the subject matter.  As
of the Effective Date, no fact is known to the Borrower which has
had, or may in the future have (so far as the Borrower can foresee),
a Materially Adverse Effect upon the Borrower and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, which has not been set forth in the financial
statements referred to in Section 6.1(n) or in such information,
reports or other papers or data or otherwise disclosed in writing to
the Agent and each Lender prior to the Agreement Date.  No document
furnished or written statement made by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation, preparation or execution of this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents contains or will contain any untrue statement of
a fact material to the creditworthiness of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statement contained therein not misleading.

          (s)  Solvency.  In each case after giving effect to the
     Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the Letter of Credit
     Obligations outstanding and to be incurred and the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and each of the Subsidiary
     Guaranties and assuming full utilization of the Commitments,
     each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor is solvent,
     having assets of a fair salable value which exceeds the amount
     required to pay its debts, and each of the Borrower and each of
     the Subsidiary Guarantors is able to and anticipates that it
     will be able to meet its debts as they mature and has adequate
     capital to conduct the business in which it is, or proposes to
     be, engaged.

          (t)  Federal Regulations.  Neither the Borrower nor any
     Subsidiary is engaged or will engage, principally or as one of
     its important activities, in the business of extending credit
     for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin
     stock" (as each of the quoted terms is defined or used in
     Regulations G and U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
     Reserve System).  Following the application of the proceeds of
     each Loan hereunder, not more than 25% of the value of the
     assets of the Borrower only, or of the Consolidated assets of
     the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, will be margin
     stock.

          (u)  Investment Company Act.  Neither the Borrower nor any
     Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a company "controlled"
     by an "investment company" (as each of the quoted terms is
     defined or used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended).

     Section   Survival of Representations and Warranties, etc.  All
representations and warranties set forth in this Article 6 and all
statements contained in any certificate, financial statement,
opinion or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to





<PAGE>





or in connection with this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents
(including but not limited to any such made in or in connection with
any amendment thereto) shall constitute representations and
warranties made under this Agreement.  All representations and
warranties made under this Agreement shall be made or deemed to be
made at and as of the Agreement Date, at the Effective Date and at
and as of the date of making each Loan or issuance of each Letter of
Credit.  All representations and warranties made or deemed to be
made under this Agreement shall survive and not be waived by the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Agent or any Lender, or any borrowing hereunder.

          such dividend declaration computed pursuant to clause (A)
          above, and provided further that, the Dividend Basket
          shall be replenished from time to time by the sum of the
          excesses, if any, of the applicable amounts computed
          pursuant to clause (A) above for each Fiscal Year
          (commencing with Fiscal Year 1995) over the amount of all
          cash dividends declared during such Fiscal Year, provided

     which the Borrower is a party, the Borrower is the surviving
     corporation, and that in the case of any merger, consolidation
     or liquidation to which a Subsidiary Guarantor and any
     Subsidiary not a Subsidiary Guarantor are parties, such
     Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving corporation and has a Net
     Worth immediately following consummation of such merger,

Notes) be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting under
this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents upon written
instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions and any

<PAGE>





and to make its Committed Advances and Competitive Loans and acquire
participations in any Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans was made
on the basis of its own credit judgment and in making such decision
it did not rely upon any representation by the Agent or any other
Lender as to the credit worthiness or financial position of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking any action under this Agreement.

     Section   Expenses and Indemnification.  To the extent that the
Borrower fails to do so (and without limiting the Obligations of the
Borrower), each Lender and each subsequent holder of a Note, by its
acceptance thereof, agrees to reimburse the Agent upon demand in
proportion to the respective Commitment Percentage of each Lender,
or, in the case of any such subsequent holder, in proportion that
the outstanding balance of such holder's Notes bears to the total
balance outstanding under all Notes, and to indemnify and hold the
Agent harmless in such proportion against any and all losses,
liabilities or expenses incurred by the Agent arising out of or in
connection with the administration of this Agreement, including the
costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of
its powers and duties hereunder and of taking any action hereunder,

not the Agent or such Affiliate.


     Section   Right to Resign.  The Agent may resign at any time by
giving 30 days written notice thereof to each Lender and the
Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Agent and if no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after any such notice
of resignation, then the retiring entity may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent.  Each successor Agent shall be a
Lender (acting exclusively through a United States branch), if any
Lender shall be willing to serve, or a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and
shall be acceptable to the Borrower in its reasonable judgment.

the event the Borrower fails to perform, observe or discharge any of
its Obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, any remedy of
law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Lenders; therefore, the

Agent so requests, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving
actual damages.

not be subject to the consent of the purchaser of such
participation, (iv) the minimum amount of principal of Committed
Advances or Commitment subject to each such participation shall be
$5,000,000 (or, if less, an amount equal to 50% of such Lender's
Commitment), (v) each Lender shall at all times retain for its own
account an interest in its rights and obligations hereunder equal to
at least 50% of its Commitment as of the Effective Date, as the same
may have been reduced pursuant to Section 4.3, (vi) each purchaser
of a participation shall be prohibited from selling any interest in
such participation, (vii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any
such Notes for all purposes of this Agreement, and (viii) the
Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.10(f),
each Lender may sell one participation in its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to a United States commercial bank which is a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the same Person of which such Lender is a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary, which participation need not comply with
the requirements of clauses (i), (iv) and (v) above, but shall
otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section 12.10(f).

          (g)  Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
     participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant
     to this Section 12.10, disclose to the assignee or participant
     or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating
     to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the
     Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the
     assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
     shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
     information relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary received
     by it from such Lender on substantially the terms set forth in
     Section 12.21.

     Section   Amendments.  No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement, the Notes or any Subsidiary Guaranty, nor consent
to any departure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary party hereto or
thereto therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same
shall be in writing and, in the case of this Agreement and the
Notes, signed by the Majority Lenders and, in the case of an
amendment, by the Borrower, or in the case of any Subsidiary
Guaranty, consented to by the Majority Lenders









<PAGE>





and signed in accordance with the terms thereof, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specified instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however,
that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by all the Lenders and, in the case of an amendment, by the
Borrower (or by the Subsidiary party to the relevant Loan Document,
as the case may be), do any of the following:  (a) waive any of the
conditions specified in Section 5.1 or 5.2, (b) increase the
Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional
obligations, (c) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes
or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Notes or any fees or other Obligations payable hereunder or under
any of the other Loan Documents, (e) release any Subsidiary
Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty, other
than in accordance with the terms thereof or as a result of a
transaction permitted pursuant to Section 9.7, (f) change the
percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations, or the number
of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them
to take any action hereunder or (g) amend this Section 12.11; and
provided, further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Lenders
required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of
the Agent under this Agreement or any Note or any other Loan
Document.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 12.11,
including, without limitation, the terms of subsections (c) and (d)
above, any Lender may agree with the Borrower (i) to change the
interest rate applicable to any Competitive Loan owing to such
Lender and (ii) subject to the terms of the definition of "Interest
Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and to the limitation that none of
the Obligations shall be due and payable later than the Termination
Date, to postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Competitive Loans owing to such Lender.

     Section   Performance of Borrower's Duties.

     (a)  The Borrower's Obligations under this Agreement and each
of the Loan Documents shall be performed by the Borrower at its sole
cost and expense.


     (b)  If the Borrower shall fail to do any act or thing which it
has covenanted to do under this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents, the Agent on behalf of the Lenders may (but shall not be
obligated to) do the same or cause it to be done either in the name
of the Agent or the Lenders or in the name and on behalf of the
Borrower and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent so
to act.

     Section   Indemnification.  The Borrower agrees to reimburse
the Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses





<PAGE>





incurred (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) and
to indemnify and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless from and
against all losses suffered by the Agent or any Lender (except to
the extent arising out of the Agent's or such Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct) in connection with

                (i) the exercise by the Agent or any Lender of any
          right or remedy granted to it under this Agreement or any
          of the Loan Documents,

               (ii) any claim, and the prosecution or defense
          thereof, arising out of or in any way connected with this
          Agreement or any of the Loan Documents (except any claim
          asserted only by a Lender or the Agent against a Lender or
          the Agent), and

               (iii) the collection or enforcement of the
          Obligations or any of them.

     Section   All Powers Coupled with Interest.  All authorizations
granted to the Agent and the Lenders and any Persons designated by
the Agent or any Lender pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement
or any of the Loan Documents shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any of the Obligations
remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

     Section   Survival.  Notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement,

          (a)  until all Obligations have been irrevocably paid in
     full or otherwise satisfied, the Agent on behalf of the Lenders
     shall retain all rights under this Agreement and each of the
     Loan Documents as fully as though this Agreement had not been
     terminated, and

          (b)   without regard to payment of principal of and
     interest on the Committed Advances, the indemnities to which
     the Agent and the Lenders are entitled under the provisions of
     this Article 12 and any other provision of this Agreement and
     the Loan Documents shall continue in full force and effect and
     shall protect the Agent and the Lenders against events arising
     after such termination as well as before.

     Section   Titles and Captions.  Titles and captions of
Articles, Sections and subsections in this Agreement are included
for convenience only, and neither limit nor amplify the provisions
of this Agreement.

     Section   Severability of Provisions.  Any provision of this
Agreement or any Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions hereof or thereof or



<PAGE>





affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

     Section   Governing Law.  This Agreement and the Notes shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State

     Section   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any

information previously or hereafter furnished to the Agent or the
Lenders, may be reproduced by the Agent or the Lenders by any
photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature
photographic or other similar process and such Person may destroy
any original document so produced.  Each party hereto stipulates
that, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any such
reproduction shall be as admissible in evidence as the original
itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not
the original shall be in existence and whether or not such
reproduction was made by such Lender in the regular course of
business), and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of
such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

     Section   Confidentiality.  Each Lender and the Agent agrees
(on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, and representatives) to use reasonable
precautions to keep confidential, in accordance with its customary
procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and
in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, any non-public

pursuant to this Agreement (collectively the "Confidential
Information"), provided that nothing herein shall limit disclosure
of any such information (i) to the extent required by statute, rule,
regulation, or judicial process, (ii) to counsel for any of the
Lenders or the Agent, solely in their capacities as such, (iii) to
examiners, auditors or accountants, solely in their capacities as
such, of such Lender or the Agent, (iv) to the Agent or any other
Lender, or by any Lender to any Affiliate of such Lender, (v) filed
by the Borrower with any governmental agency, which information is
available to the public or available for inspection by the public,
(vi) in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.10(g) or (vii)
where necessary in any litigation between or among the parties
hereto arising out of this Agreement or any

                         SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY


       THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of _____________, 199_ (the
  "Guaranty Agreement"), is given by __________________, a
  ______________ corporation (the "Guarantor"), in connection with
  that certain Credit Agreement dated as of September __, 1994 (as
  amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") among Delta
  Woodside Industries, Inc., a South Carolina corporation (herein with
  its successors called the "Borrower"), various financial
  institutions parties thereto (the "Lenders") and NationsBank of
  North Carolina, N.A., as Agent for such Lenders.  Terms defined in
  the Credit Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, used
  herein as defined in the Credit Agreement.


                        W I T N E S S E T H :

       WHEREAS, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have
  agreed to provide the Borrower with certain credit facilities,
  including Committed Loans, Competitive Loans and Swingline Loans and
  Letters of Credit, in an aggregate principal amount outstanding of
  up to $275,000,000; and

       WHEREAS, the Guarantor is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of
  the Borrower and the Borrower is required pursuant to Section 5.1 or
  Section 7.10 of the Credit Agreement to cause the Guarantor to enter
  into this Guaranty Agreement.

       NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the Lenders to make available the
  credit facilities described above pursuant to the Credit Agreement
  and in consideration of the premises, the Guarantor hereby agrees as
  follows:

       1.   Guaranty of Payment.  The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
  unconditionally guarantees to the Agent and the Lenders the prompt
  payment, when due, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Guaranteed
  Obligations.  For purposes of this Guaranty Agreement, "Guaranteed
  Obligations" means any and all indebtedness of the Borrower or any
  other Subsidiary Guarantor to the Agent or the Lenders under the
  Credit Agreement, the Notes, the Subsidiary Guaranties or any other
  of the Loan Documents including, without limitation, all principal,
  interest and fees and any and all reimbursement obligations and
  other indebtedness arising on account of drawings under Letters of
  Credit plus any and all other indebtedness of the Borrower or any
  other Subsidiary Guarantor to the Agent or any Lender under the Loan
  Documents, whether existing now or arising hereafter, as such
  Guaranteed Obligations may be modified, extended or renewed from
  time to time.  The guaranty of the Guarantor as set forth in this
  section





<PAGE>
 FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


  is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.


  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
  the Loan Documents, the liability of the Guarantor with respect to
  the Guaranteed Obligations shall not exceed the Maximum Obligated
  Amount (as hereinafter defined).

  For the purposes hereof:

  "Adjusted Net Worth" means, as of any date of determination thereof,
  the excess of (i) the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of
  the assets of the Guarantor as of such date of determination, over
  (ii) the amount of all "liabilities, contingent or otherwise", of
  the Guarantor as of such date of determination, as such quoted terms
  are determined in accordance with applicable Federal and state laws
  governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors.  In
  determining Adjusted Net Worth for the purposes of calculating the
  Maximum Obligated Amount in respect of any Extension of Credit, the
  liabilities to be used in such determination pursuant to clause (ii)
  of the preceding sentence shall in any event include the liabilities
  of the Guarantor hereunder in respect of all Extensions of Credit
  other than the Extension of Credit in respect of which such
  calculation is being made;

  "Extension of Credit" means any Loan advanced under the Credit
  Agreement and any Letter of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement
  (and obligations to make advances thereunder);

  "Maximum Obligated Amount" means, as of any date of determination
  thereof, the sum of (i) with respect to each Extension of Credit (or
  portion thereof) which is used (or the proceeds of which are used)
  to make a Direct Transfer to the Guarantor, the outstanding amount
  of such Extension of Credit (or such portion thereof) as of such
  date, plus (ii) with respect to each Extension of Credit (or portion
  thereof) which is not used (or the proceeds of which are not used)
  to make a Direct Transfer to the Guarantor, the lesser of (a) the
  outstanding amount of all such Extensions of Credit (or such
  portions thereof) as of the earlier of the date that enforcement is
  sought against the Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed
  Obligations hereunder or the date of the commencement of a case
  under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in which the Guarantor is a debtor,
  or (b) 95% of the Adjusted Net Worth of the Guarantor at the time of
  each such Extension of Credit; and

  "Direct Transfer" means (i) all loans, advances or capital
  contributions made to or for the direct benefit of, or letters of
  credit issued for the account of or direct benefit of, the Guarantor
  with any Extension of Credit (or with any proceeds thereof), (ii)
  all debt securities or other obligations of the Guarantor acquired
  from the Guarantor, retired by the Guarantor or collateralized by
  the Guarantor with any Extension of Credit







<PAGE>
 FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


  (or with any proceeds thereof), (iii) the fair market value of all
  property acquired with any Extension of Credit (or with any proceeds
  thereof) and transferred, absolutely and not as collateral, to the
  Guarantor and (iv) all equity securities of the Guarantor acquired
  from the Guarantor with any Extension of Credit (or with any
  proceeds thereof).

       2.   Release of Collateral, Parties Liable, etc.  The Guarantor
  agrees that the whole or any part of the security now or hereafter
  held for the Guaranteed Obligations may be exchanged, compromised,
  released or surrendered from time to time; that neither the Agent
  nor the Lenders (in their respective capacities as such) shall have
  any obligation to protect, perfect, secure or insure any security
  interests, liens or encumbrances now or hereafter held for the
  Guaranteed Obligations or the properties subject thereto; that the
  time or place of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations may be
  changed or extended, in whole or in part, to a time certain or
  otherwise, and may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or in part;
  that the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor may be granted
  indulgences generally; that any of the provisions of the Loan
  Documents, or any of them, or any other documents executed in
  connection with this transaction, may be modified, amended or
  waived; that any party liable for the payment thereof may be granted
  indulgences or released; and that any deposit balance for the credit
  of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor or any other party
  liable for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or liable upon
  any security therefor may be released, in whole or in part, at,
  before and/or after the stated, extended or accelerated maturity of
  the Guaranteed Obligations, all without notice to or further assent
  by the Guarantor, who shall remain bound hereon, notwithstanding any
  such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal,
  acceleration, modification, indulgence or release.

       3.   Waiver of Rights.  The Guarantor expressly waives:  (a)
  notice of acceptance of this Guaranty Agreement by the Agent and the
  Lenders and of all extensions of credit to the Borrower by the Agent
  or any Lender; (b) presentment and demand for payment of any of the
  Guaranteed Obligations; (c) protest and notice of dishonor or of
  default to the Guarantor or to any other party with respect to the
  Guaranteed Obligations or with respect to any security therefor; (d)
  notice of the Agent or any Lender obtain- ing, amending,
  substituting for, releasing, waiving or modifying any security
  interest, liens, or encumbrances now or hereafter securing the
  Guaranteed Obligations, or the Agent's or any Lender's
  subordinating, compromising, discharging or releasing such security
  interests, liens or encumbrances; (e) all other notices to which the
  Guarantor might otherwise be entitled; (f) demand for payment under
  this Guaranty Agreement; and (g) any right to assert against the
  Agent or any Lender, as a defense, counterclaim, set-off, or cross-
  claim any defense (legal or equitable), set-off, counterclaim or
  claim which the Guarantor may now or hereafter have against the
  Agent or any Lender or the







<PAGE>
 FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


  Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, but such waiver shall
  not prevent the Guarantor from asserting against the Agent, any
  Lender, the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor in a separate
  action, any claim, action, cause of action, or demand that the
  Guarantor might have, whether or not arising out of this Guaranty
  Agreement.

       4.   Primary Liability of Guarantor.  The Guarantor agrees that
  this Guaranty Agreement may be enforced by the Agent and the Lenders
  without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any
  other security or collateral and without the necessity at any time
  of having recourse to the Notes, any other Subsidiary Guaranty or
  any collateral now or hereafter securing the Guaranteed Obligations
  or otherwise, and the Guarantor hereby waives the right to require
  the Agent and the Lenders to proceed against the Borrower, any other
  Subsidiary Guarantor or any other person (including a co-guarantor)
  or to require the Agent and the Lenders to pursue any other remedy
  or enforce any other right. Without limiting the generality of the
  foregoing, the Guarantor hereby specifically waives the benefits of
  N.C. Gen. Stat. Sections 26-7 through 26-9, inclusive.  In addition,
  the Guarantor hereby waives and renounces any and all rights it has
  or may have for subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or
  contribution against the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor
  for amounts paid under this Guaranty Agreement.  This waiver is
  expressly intended to prevent the existence of any claim in respect
  of such reimbursement by the Guarantor against the estate of the
  Borrower or of any other Subsidiary Guarantor within the meaning of
  Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to prevent the Guarantor
  from being deemed a "creditor" of the Borrower or any other
  Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of such reimbursement within the
  meaning of Section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in the event of a
  subsequent case involving the Borrower or any such other Subsidiary
  Guarantor.  The Guarantor further agrees that nothing contained
  herein shall prevent the Agent or the Lenders from suing on the
  Notes or on any other Subsidiary Guaranty or foreclosing their
  security interest in or lien on any collateral now or hereafter
  securing the Guaranteed Obligations or from exercising any other
  rights available to them under the Notes, any other Subsidiary
  Guaranty, or any other instrument of security if neither the
  Borrower, the other Subsidiary Guarantors nor the Guarantor timely
  perform the obligations of the Borrower or such other Subsidiary
  Guarantors, as the case may be thereunder, and the exercise of any
  of the aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure
  proceedings shall not constitute a discharge (except to the extent
  of any payment received which irrevocably reduces the amount of the
  Guaranteed Obligations) of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder; it
  being the purpose and intent of the Guarantor that its obligations
  hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any
  and all circumstances. Neither the Guarantor's obligations under
  this Guaranty Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof
  shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner
  whatsoever by an







<PAGE>
 FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


  impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the
  liability of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, by
  reason of the Borrower's or any other Subsidiary Guarantor's
  bankruptcy or insolvency or by reason of the invalidity or
  unenforceability of all or any portion of the Guaranteed
  Obligations.  The Guarantor acknowledges that the term "Guaranteed
  Obligations" as used herein includes any payments made by the
  Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor to the Agent or any
  Lender and subsequently recovered by the Borrower or such other
  Subsidiary Guarantor or a trustee for the Borrower or such other
  Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to the Borrower's or such other
  Subsidiary Guarantor's bankruptcy or insolvency and that the
  guaranty of the Guarantor hereunder shall be reinstated to the
  extent of such recovery.

       5.   Attorneys' Fees and Costs of Collection.  If at any time
  or times hereafter the Agent or the Lenders employ counsel to pursue
  collection, to sue for enforcement of the terms hereof or of the
  Notes or of any other Subsidiary Guaranty, or to file a petition,
  complaint, answer, motion or other pleading in any suit or
  proceeding relating to this Guaranty Agreement or the Notes or any
  other Subsidiary Guaranty, then in such event, all of the reasonable
  attorneys' fees relating thereto shall be an addi- tional liability
  of the Guarantor to the Agent and the Lenders, payable on demand.

       6.   Security Interests and Setoff.  As security for the
  Guarantor's obligations hereunder, the Guarantor agrees that (a) in
  the event the Guarantor fails to pay its obligations hereunder when
  due and payable under this Guaranty Agreement, any of the
  Guarantor's assets of any kind, nature or description (including,
  without limitation, deposit accounts) in the possession, control or
  custody of the Agent or any Lender may, without notice to the
  Guarantor, be reduced to cash or the like and applied by the Agent
  or such Lender in reduction or payment of the Guarantor's
  obligations hereunder; (b) all outstanding security interests, liens
  and encumbrances heretofore, now and at any time or times hereafter
  granted by the Guarantor to the Agent or any Lender shall also
  secure the Guarantor's obligations hereunder; and (c) after any of
  the Guaranteed Obligations have become due and payable as the result
  of the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement,
  the Agent and each Lender shall have the right, immediately and
  without further action by them, to set off against the Guaranteed
  Obligations all money owed by the Agent or such Lender in any
  capacity to the Guarantor, whether or not due, and the Agent or such
  Lender shall be deemed to have made a charge against any such money
  immediately upon the occurrence of such obligation becoming due even
  though such charge is made or entered on the books of the Agent or
  such Lender subsequent thereto.

       7.   Term of Guaranty; Warranties.  This Guaranty Agreement
  shall continue in full force and effect until the Guaranteed
  Obligations are fully and indefeasibly paid, performed and

 FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


  discharged.  This Guaranty Agreement covers the Guaranteed
  Obligations whether presently outstanding or arising subsequent to
  the date hereof including all amounts advanced by the Agent or any
  Lender in stages or installments.  The Guarantor warrants and
  represents to the Agent and the Lenders (i) that the Guarantor is a
  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
  under the laws of its state of incorporation, (ii) that the
  Guarantor has all requisite corporate power and authority to
  execute, deliver and perform this Guaranty Agreement, (iii) that the
  execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty Agreement by
  the Guarantor do not violate or constitute a breach of any material
  agreement or instrument by which the Guarantor or its properties or
  assets are bound or of any material provision of law, any order of
  any court or other agency of government or the corporate charter or
  certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Guarantor, (iv) that
  this Guaranty Agreement is binding upon and enforceable against the
  Guarantor, in accordance with its terms, (v) that, except as
  disclosed in Schedule 6.1(j) to the Credit Agreement, there is no
  litigation, claim, action or proceeding pending, or, to the best
  knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened, against the Guarantor which
  would materially adversely affect the financial condition of the
  Guarantor or its ability to fulfill its obligations hereunder, and
  (vi) that no consent, approval or authorization of, or filing,
  registration or qualification with, any governmental authority on
  the part of the Guarantor is required as a condition to the
  execution, delivery or performance by the Guarantor, or for the
  validity or enforceability, of this Guaranty Agreement.  This
  Guaranty Agreement is binding on and enforceable against the
  Guarantor and its successors and assigns.

       8.   Further Representations and Warranties.  The Guarantor
  agrees that the Agent and the Lenders will have no obligation to
  investigate the financial condition or affairs of the Borrower or
  any other Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of the Guarantor nor
  to advise the Guarantor of any fact respecting, or any change in,
  the financial condition or affairs of the Borrower or of any other
  Subsidiary Guarantor which might come to the knowledge of the Agent
  or any Lender at any time, whether or not the Agent or any Lender
  knows or believes or has reason to know or believe that any such
  fact or change is unknown to the Guarantor or might (or does)
  materially increase the risk of the Guarantor as guarantor or might
  (or would) affect the willingness of the Guarantor to continue as
  guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations.

       9.   Additional Liability of Guarantor.  If the Guarantor is or
  becomes liable for any indebtedness owing by the Borrower or any
  other Subsidiary Guarantor to the Agent or any Lender by endorsement
  or otherwise other than under this Guaranty Agreement, such
  liability shall not be in any manner impaired or reduced hereby but
  shall have all and the same force and effect it would have had if
  this Guaranty Agreement had not existed and the Guarantor's
  liability hereunder shall not be in any manner







<PAGE>
 FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


  impaired or reduced thereby.

       10.  Cumulative Rights.  All rights of the Agent and each
  Lender hereunder or otherwise arising under any documents executed
  in connection with or as security for the Guaranteed Obligations are
  separate and cumulative and may be pursued separately, successively
  or concurrently, or not pursued, without affecting or limiting any
  other right of the Agent or any Lender and without affecting or
  impairing the liability of the Guarantor hereunder.

       11.  Pronouns; Severability.  The pronouns used in this
  instrument shall be construed as masculine, feminine or neuter as
  the occasion may require.

       12.  Agent and Lender Assigns.  This Guaranty Agreement is
  intended for and shall inure to the benefit of the Agent and each
  Lender and each and every person who shall from time to time be or
  become the owner or holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and
  each and every reference herein to "Agent" or "Lender" shall include
  and refer to each and every successor or assignee of the Agent or
  any Lender at any time holding or owning any part of or interest in
  any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.  This Guaranty Agreement
  shall be transferable and negotiable with the same force and effect,
  and to the same extent, that the Guaranteed Obligations are
  transferable and negotiable, it being understood and stipulated that
  upon assignment or transfer by the Agent or any Lender of any of the
  Guaranteed Obligations the legal holder or owner of the Guaranteed
  Obligations (or a part thereof or interest therein thus transferred
  or assigned by the Agent or any Lender) shall (except as otherwise
  stipulated by the Agent or any such Lender in its assignment) have
  and may exercise all of the rights granted to the Agent or such
  Lender under this Guaranty Agreement to the extent of that part of
  or interest in the Guaranteed Obligations thus assigned or
  transferred to said person.  The Guarantor expressly waives notice
  of transfer or assignment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part
  thereof, or of the rights of the Agent or any Lender hereunder.
  Failure to give notice will not affect the liabilities of the
  Guarantor hereunder.

       13.  Application of Payments.  The Agent and any Lender may
  apply any payments received by them from any source against that
  portion of the Guaranteed Obligations (principal, interest, court
  costs, attorneys' fees or other) in such priority and fashion as
  they may deem appropriate in conformity with the Credit Agreement.

       14.  Notices.  Any notice shall be conclusively deemed to have
  been received by any party hereto and be effective on the day on
  which delivered to such party at the address set forth below or such
  other address as such party shall specify to the other party in
  writing, or if sent prepaid by certified or registered mail on the

                 Attention:  E. Phifer Helms

       This section shall not be construed in any way to affect or
  impair any waiver of notice or demand herein provided or to require
  giving of notice or demand to or upon the Guarantor in any situation
  or for any reason.

       15.  Headings.  The headings herein are inserted only as a
  matter of convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit
  or describe the scope of this Guaranty Agreement nor the intent of
  any provisions hereof.

       17.  Net Payments.  All payments made by the Guarantor

  or other charges of whatsoever nature, imposed, levied, collected,
  withheld or assessed by any governmental or taxing authority (other

  District of Columbia), excluding income and franchise taxes imposed
  on a Lender by a jurisdiction under which such Lender is organized
  or operating in connection with the Credit Agreement or any
  political subdivision thereof (the "Taxes").  If the Guarantor shall
  be required to withhold or deduct Taxes from any sum payable

  necessary so that the amount received is equal to the sum which
  would have been received had no withholdings or deductions been
  made, (ii) the Guarantor shall make such necessary withholdings or
  deductions and (iii) the Guarantor shall pay the full amount
  withheld or deducted to the relevant authority according to
  applicable law so that the Lenders shall not be required to make any
  deduction or payment of Taxes.

       18.  Entire Agreement.  The Guaranty Agreement constitutes the
  entire contract among the parties relative to the subject matter
  hereof.  Any previous agreement among the parties with respect to

  of Jury Trial; Arbritration.  (a) This Guaranty Agreement shall be
  deemed to be a contract made under, and for all purposes shall be
  construed in accordance with, the internal laws and judicial
  decisions of the State of North Carolina.  Each of the Guarantor,
  the Agent and the Lenders agree that any dispute arising out of this
  Guaranty Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of both the
  state and federal courts in North Carolina.  For that purpose, the
  Guarantor hereby submits to the jurisdiction and venue of the state
  and federal courts of North Carolina and agrees not to raise as a
  defense that such courts are not a convenient forum.  The Guarantor
  further agrees to accept service of process out of any of the
  beforementioned courts in any such dispute by registered or
  certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the
  Guarantor.

       (b)  THE GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
  BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
  RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
  HEREBY.

       [(c)(i)(A)  Without limiting the generality of subsections (a)
  and (b) above, the Guarantor agrees that any controversy or claim
  with respect to the Guarantor arising out of or relating to this

  in the City of Charlotte, North Carolina (or such other place as the
  parties may agree) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
  Rules then obtaining of the American

  Arbitration Association.  Upon the request and submission of any
  controversy or claim for arbitration hereunder, the Agent shall give
  the Guarantor not less than 45 days written notice of the request
  for arbitration, the nature of the controversy or claim, and the
  time and place set for arbitration.  The Guarantor agrees that such
  notice is reasonable to enable the Guarantor sufficient time to
  prepare and present its case before the arbitration panel.  Judgment
  on the award rendered by the arbitration panel may be entered in any
  court in which any action could have been brought or maintained
  pursuant to subparagraph (C) below, including without limitation any
  court of the State of North Carolina or any Federal court sitting in
  the State of North Carolina.  The expenses of arbitration shall be
  paid by the non- prevailing party(ies).

       (B)  The provisions of subparagraph (A) above are intended to
  comply with the requirements of the Convention on the Recognition
  and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the "Convention").  To
  the extent that any provisions of such subparagraph (A) are not
  consistent with or fail to conform to the requirements set out in
  the Convention, such subparagraph (A) shall be deemed amended to
  conform to the requirements of the Convention.

       (C)  The Guarantor hereby specifically consents and submits to
  the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of North Carolina and
  courts of the United States located in the State of North Carolina
  for purposes of entry of a judgment or arbitration award entered by
  the arbitration panel.

  process agent in its name, place and stead to receive and forward
  service of any and all writs, summonses and other legal process in
  any suit, action or proceeding brought in the State of North
  Carolina, agrees that such service in any such suit, action or
  proceeding may be made upon the North Carolina Process Agent and
  agrees to take all such action as may be necessary to continue said
  appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent so
  that the Guarantor will at all times have an agent in the State of
  North Carolina for service of process for the above purposes.

          (ii)   The guarantee of the Guarantor pursuant to this
  Guaranty Agreement is (in part) an international transaction in
  which payment of dollars in Charlotte, North Carolina, is of the
  essence, and dollars shall be the currency of account in all events.
  The payment obligation of the Guarantor shall not be discharged by
  an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether
  pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount
  so paid on prompt conversion to dollars and transfer to Charlotte,
  North Carolina, under normal banking

  procedures does not yield the amount of dollars in Charlotte, North
  Carolina due hereunder.  In the event that any payment by the
  Guarantor, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, upon
  conversion and transfer does not result in payment of such amount of
  dollars in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Agent and the Lenders
  shall have a separate cause of action against the Guarantor for the
  additional amount necessary to yield the amount due and owing to the
  Agent and the Lenders hereunder.]

  Columbia. *

  Agreement to be duly executed by its duly authorized officer as of
  the date first above written.

TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

E. ERWIN MADDREY, II
To Our Fellow Shareholders:
  Fiscal 1994 began with most of our markets suffering from weak retail demand
which began to steadily improve as the year progressed. The weakness started
during our 1993 fiscal year and continued into 1994. It was only towards the end
of our fiscal year that we began to feel improved demand. As a result of the
lower demand through the major part of fiscal 1994, our sales dropped 11% to
$614 million from the prior year level. This weakness in demand was caused by
the continuing uncertainty of consumer confidence that has kept apparel
retailers' buying habits very cautious.
  During the year, in light of the soft economic conditions, we made an in-depth
analysis of all of our businesses and determined that we should sell our office
products division. We also decided that some restructuring was necessary in our
apparel businesses. During fiscal 1994 we took a restructuring charge of $9.2
million.
  Also, in the second quarter, we received the unexpected news that an Alabama
jury had awarded a former sales representative of the Company and two of his
assistants $29 million in a suit over commissions. This award was later reduced
to $23 million by the trial judge. We believe that this award is unjustifiable
and have appealed it to the Alabama Supreme Court. We recorded a litigation
reserve for the entire amount in the second quarter of fiscal 1994.
  Because of the poor demand in the first part of the year, the restructuring
charge, and the litigation reserve, we reported a loss of $17 million for the
year.
  Our businesses are better and we are looking forward to our 1995 fiscal year.
  Our textile fabrics operation has two parts -- a woven division and a knit
division. The woven division, which produces bottom weight fabrics for the
casual pants and dress pants markets as well as a variety of other finished and
unfinished fabrics, had mixed results during the year. Demand on the casual side
was very strong and those plants have run full. However, the demand for casual
products has decreased the demand for dress pants, and that part of the
business, as well as our unfinished fabrics facilities, have run curtailed
operating schedules. We have embarked on a major expansion and modernization
program in this division which will result in increased capacity for casual
fabrics and lower costs for all of the fabrics made by this division. We expect
increased production early in fiscal 1996 which will allow our woven fabrics
division to further improve its important position in the domestic casual pants
market.
  We have completed the modernization of our knit fabrics division. Over the
last few years, we have reduced this division's manufacturing facilities from
eight to five. Today, the five plants are producing more pounds than the eight
did. The extensive machinery changes that we went through to reach this point
were very disruptive and expensive and caused this division to be unprofitable
in 1994. Now, with these changes behind us and lower cost manufacturing capacity
in place, we expect this division to become a significant profit contributor.
  Our knit apparel division suffered from poor demand in the T-shirt and
sweatshirt markets during the first half of the year. In the last half, demand
returned to more normal levels and our operations improved as running schedules
increased.

  Since the purchase of Duck Head in 1989 we have been trying to catch up with
demand for the product. Because some of our systems were not able to handle the
increased volume, we began experiencing delivery problems in fiscal 1992 and did
a poor job servicing our customers. We lost some customers because of this, and
we have shrunk this business back to a more manageable level. As we become
confident in our systems, we will begin to grow again. A major element is a new
distribution center to replace several smaller distribution centers. This will
be built during calendar 1995.
  We have been pleased with the growth of Nautilus' core commercial business. We
are beginning to test market a consumer line. Hopefully, this will allow us to
begin participating in the much larger consumer market.
  During 1994, we spent $30 million on capital expenditures. In 1995, we plan to
spend $45 million on new capital programs. The major items will be the
acceleration of the Delta Mills expansion and modernization program and the Duck
Head distribution center.
  In June, we completed the sale of our office products division, Harper
Brothers, to Denver based Corporate Express, Inc. Our analysis of our business
led us to conclude that Harper Brothers would be better owned by someone in the
office products business.
  Fiscal 1994 was a tough year and, frankly, one that we are glad to have behind
us. We are pleased with the condition of our businesses today and are looking
forward to the better results that better markets bring.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CONSOLIDATED COMPANY RESULTS
FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993
  Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended July 2, 1994 (52 weeks) were
$613,776,000, a decrease of $72,463,000 from the prior year's $686,239,000 (53
weeks). Net sales in fiscal 1994 decreased in both the textile and apparel
segments as compared with net sales in fiscal 1993.
  Consolidated gross profit margin for fiscal 1994 decreased to 16% compared to
18% in fiscal 1993. Gross margins in fiscal 1994 were impacted by disruption
costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's knit finishing plants,
by low prices on the sale of closeout apparel merchandise, and by cotton costs
rising more rapidly than prices in the January-June 1994 period.

(Net Sales bar chart appears here--see appendix)

  Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal 1994 was
$82.2 million, or 13% of sales, compared to $73.4 million, or 11% of sales,
incurred in fiscal 1993.
  In fiscal 1994, the Company charged income for $27.1 million to establish a
reserve for a judgment entered by an Alabama court in connection with a jury
award made on November 24, 1993 in favor of a former independent sales
representative of a subsidiary of the Company and two of his assistants (the
"Alabama litigation"), interest costs on that judgment, and related legal
expenses in connection with the appeals process. The appeal is now before the
Alabama Supreme Court. The Company believes that this charge to fiscal 1994
income fully reserves future costs associated with this action.
  In view of weak market conditions and the Company's poor performance in the
July to December 1993 period, the Company made certain restructuring decisions
at the end of its second fiscal quarter.
  One of these decisions was to dispose of its Harper Brothers office products
distribution division by sale or liquidation. The Company hoped that it would be
able to find a qualified buyer who was experienced in the office supply business
so that the employees in that division would not be displaced. The Company was
successful in finding such a buyer, a subsidiary of Corporate Express, Inc., and
the sale of Harper Brothers was completed as of June 4, 1994. The restructuring
charge, as adjusted, for this decision was $3.2 million.
  The Company had been working on plans to convert its former spinning plant
building in Edgefield, South Carolina into an outlet mall. Plans were drawn,
cleanup work had been started, but after several months of research were
completed, in December 1993 the decision was made to abandon this plan and write
off the assets involved. The restructuring charge for this decision was $1.3
million.
  The Company's branded apparel business incurred operating losses in the July
to December 1993 period for the first time since it was acquired in February
1989. The Company decided to close its girls and juniors branded apparel line,
including liquidating this line's inventory, and focus on its core young mens
business. The restructuring charge for this decision was $1.3 million. At the
same time, the decision was made to consolidate the branded apparel distribution
operations from several geographically scattered warehouses into a central
distribution and office complex to be constructed in calendar 1995. The
restructuring charge for this decision was $1.1 million.
  The remainder of the restructuring charges to pre-tax income incurred in the
second quarter of fiscal 1994 involved several smaller projects, principally
those relating to the consolidation of the physical facilities of the knit
textile division.
  These restructuring decisions included write-downs of $1.6 million of goodwill
and $2.1 of property plant and equipment. At July 2, 1994, $2.4 million remain
in accrued liabilities related
4

<PAGE>
primarily to leases on vacant facilities and other future costs of the
restructuring plan.
  Net interest expense totalled $7.9 million during fiscal 1994 as compared to
$7.4 million incurred in fiscal 1993. The Company's outstanding debt at July 2,
1994 was $162.8 million compared with $132.2 million at July 3, 1993. During the
first six months of fiscal 1994, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of
its Common Stock for approximately $25.3 million.
  Net losses for the year ended July 2, 1994 were $17.3 million compared with
net income of $27.3 million for the prior fiscal year. If the charges taken in
fiscal 1994 for the Alabama litigation and restructuring were excluded, a fiscal
1994 net income of approximately $5.7 million would have resulted.
  Total Company inventories increased to $203.8 million at July 2, 1994 compared
to $198.3 million at the end of fiscal 1993, an increase of 3%.
  Consolidated order backlogs totalled $151.5 million at July 2, 1994, a
decrease of $10.6 million, or 7%, from total backlogs at July 3, 1993. Order
backlogs for woven textiles and branded apparel were lower, and backlogs for
knitted textiles and apparel were higher, at the end of fiscal 1994 as compared
to fiscal 1993. The Company believes that order backlogs are generally
indicative of future sales.
  Order intake and billings of the Company's unfinished woven fabrics (griege
goods) softened considerably during the second half of fiscal 1994, and they
remain very soft. Sales of finished all-cotton woven fabrics remain strong, but
sales of synthetic fiber woven fabrics are weak due to low levels of women's
wear activity at retail. As noted above, both the knitted textile and knitted
apparel operations are working off higher order backlogs than a year ago,
although recent signs indicate that the T-shirt pipeline is refilling.
The Company's results are highly dependent on retail activity in its product
categories. So far in calendar 1994, growth in sales of durable goods has
outpaced sales growth for soft goods. The Company is unable to predict when
consumers will move more of their purchases into the soft goods sector.
FISCAL 1993 VERSUS FISCAL 1992
  Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended July 3, 1993 (53 weeks) were
$686,239,000, a decrease of $18,798,000 from the prior year's (52 weeks) record
high of $705,037,000. Net sales in fiscal 1993 decreased in the Company's
textile segment and increased in the apparel segment as compared with net sales
in fiscal 1992. Net sales in fiscal 1993 in the Company's other businesses
increased due to the acquisition of Nautilus International, Inc. in January
1993. Nautilus' sales of $7.8 million for five months beginning February 1993
are included in the Company's consolidated results for fiscal 1993.

(Net Income (Loss) bar chart appears here--see appendix)

  Consolidated gross profit margin for fiscal 1993 decreased to 18% compared to
20% achieved in the prior fiscal year. Gross margins in fiscal 1993 were
adversely impacted by lower prices for knit textiles and apparel, lower prices
for unfinished woven fabrics, and higher unit sales of apparel at closeout
prices.
  Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal 1993 was
$73.4 million, or 11% of sales, compared to $64.2 million, or 9% of sales,
incurred in fiscal 1992. These expenses were flat in the textile segment but
were higher in the Company's apparel segment in fiscal 1993 as compared to the
prior fiscal year. In addition, about one half of the increased selling,
general, and administrative expense increase over fiscal 1992 was attributable
to the inclusion of Nautilus in the Company's consolidated results for the year
ended July 3, 1993.
  Interest expense decreased by $3.7 million from the prior year to the current
year. The Company's borrowing costs decreased along with the general decline in
interest rates. The Company's outstanding debt at July 3, 1993 was $132.2
million compared with $112.1 million at the beginning of fiscal 1993. During
fiscal 1993, about $20.5 million of the Company's revolving line of credit was
used in connection with the acquisition of 100% of the stock of Nautilus
International, Inc. and 70% of the stock of Apparel Marketing Corporation.
  During fiscal 1993 the Company adopted FASB Statement 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The cumulative effect on prior years of adopting
                                                                               5

<PAGE>
the Statement resulted in a charge of $875,000, or $.04 per share.
  Net income for fiscal year 1993 was $27.3 million compared to $40.0 million
earned in fiscal year 1992, a decrease of 32%. Net income for the year ended
July 3, 1993 includes approximately $1.5 million arising from a gain related to
the fire at one of the Company's Nautilus plants at Independence, Virginia on
March 13, 1993.
  Total Company inventories increased to $198.3 million at July 3, 1993 from
$177.6 million at June 27, 1992, an increase of 12%. Inventory levels in all the
Company's segments increased in fiscal 1993, due principally to weakness in the
woven greige goods markets and to lower than anticipated apparel sales in the
first six months of calendar 1993. Nautilus' inventories at the end of fiscal
1993 were $2.9 million.

TEXTILE SEGMENT
FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993
  The Company's textile segment consists of finished woven and knitted textile
fabrics sold principally to manufacturers of apparel products. The Company also
sells greige goods to fabric converters for various end uses, including
pocketing, linings, and lightweight apparel.

(Net Income as a % of Sales bar chart appears here--see appendix)

  Net sales in this segment decreased from $444.9 million in the fiscal year
ended July 3, 1993 to $391.4 million in the fiscal year ended July 2, 1994. Net
sales of knitted textiles were down 14% from fiscal 1993, due to the lower
number of units sold, to lower unit sales prices, and to disruptions in the
Company's knit fabric finishing operations resulting from the combining of two
finishing plants into one during the year. Average prices in all knit fabric
categories during the first three quarters of fiscal 1994 decreased from levels
of the prior year, but began to return toward prior year levels during the last
fiscal quarter of 1994. Sales of woven textiles were 11% lower in fiscal 1994
than in fiscal 1993. Higher sales of all cotton finished fabric (1% increase)
were more than offset by a sharp decline in sales of synthetic fiber finished
fabrics (19% decrease) and greige goods (24% decrease).
  Gross profit margins in the textile segment declined from 13% in fiscal 1993
to 12% in fiscal 1994. While gross profit margins in woven textiles were equal
in fiscal 1994 to those of the prior year, margins in knitted textiles were 4.4
percentage points lower. The drop in knitted textile margins was due to the
lower unit selling prices noted above, and to high unfavorable manufacturing
variances associated with the disruption caused by the finishing plants'
consolidation.
  Selling, general and administrative costs in the textile segment were slightly
higher in fiscal 1994 than in fiscal 1993 in dollars. As a percent of net sales,
these costs were 6.1% in fiscal 1994 as compared to 5.2% in fiscal 1993.

(Shareholders' Equity bar chart appears here--see appendix)

  Operating profits in the textile segment decreased $15.1 million, or 43%, from
fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994. The lower volume and lower gross margins discussed
above were the principal contributors to this decrease.
  During fiscal 1994, the textile segment contributed 64% of the Company's
consolidated net sales and 46% of the Company's consolidated gross profit.
  Textile segment inventories increased by $8.2 million from the end of fiscal
1993 to the end of fiscal 1994. The major part of this increase was in woven
greige goods inventory.

<PAGE>
  The textile segment's capital expenditures totalled approximately $18.3
million for the fiscal year ended July 2, 1994. The major portion of this amount
was for the knitted textile plant consolidation project and knitted fabric
finishing equipment. Also included were initial expenditures for the woven
textile long-term modernization project.
  The Company expects that its knit textile facilities and its woven all-cotton
facilities will run at or near full capacity during fiscal 1995. However, woven
synthetic and greige goods facilities are not expected to run full schedules for
at least the first half of fiscal 1995.
  Cotton prices increased sharply in the second half of fiscal 1994. Although
some textile fabric prices have increased, the Company has not yet passed its
total cotton cost increases to its customers. Profits of the textile segment are
sensitive to the amount of its manufacturing capacity utilized, to the cost and
availability of raw materials, and to the mix of goods produced.
FISCAL 1993 VERSUS 1992
  Net sales in the textile segment decreased from $472.8 million in the fiscal
year ended June 27, 1992 to $444.9 million in the fiscal year ended July 3,
1993. Net sales of knitted textiles were down 12% to $119.9 million and net
sales of woven fabrics decreased 4% to $325.1 million from fiscal 1992 to fiscal
1993.
  Sales of knitted textiles were affected adversely by prices which were 13%
lower, on average, in fiscal 1993 than in fiscal 1992. Unit sales of knitted
fabrics increased by 3%. Sales of woven camouflage and other military-type
fabrics sold primarily to the U.S. Defense Department contractors decreased to
$23.6 million in fiscal 1993 from $63.6 million in fiscal 1992, but the sales
shortfall in this area was more than offset by increases in sales of finished
woven fabrics to manufacturers of men's and women's apparel. Sales of unfinished
woven textiles were very weak for the first six months of fiscal 1993, resulting
in a year to year decline of 24% in the greige goods area. On balance, sales
increases of woven finished textiles were more than offset by decreased sales of
greige goods.
  Gross profit margins in the textile segment declined from 16% in fiscal 1992
to 13% in fiscal 1993. The principal cause of this decline was the lower prices
for knitted fabrics referred to above. In addition, profit margins for
unfinished woven fabrics were significantly lower in fiscal 1993 than in the
prior fiscal year. Another factor contributing to the gross profit margin
decline was related to the rapid growth during the fiscal year in demand for the
Company's woven and dyed all cotton sportswear fabrics. Some of the Company's
woven fabrics spinning and weaving plants found it difficult to meet quality
expectations for all cotton dyed fabrics. As a result, off quality losses were
higher in fiscal 1993 than in fiscal 1992. The Company began long term capital
projects to address this issue.
  Selling, general and administrative costs in the textile segment were about
the same in fiscal 1993 as in the prior fiscal year. However, as a percent of
net sales, these costs were 5.2% for the year ended July 3, 1993 as compared to
4.9% in the year ended June 27, 1992.
  Operating profits in the textile segment decreased $18.3 million, or 35%, in
fiscal 1993 compared to the prior year. The lower prices for knitted fabrics and
lower demand for woven greige goods were the principal causes of the decline in
operating profits.
  During fiscal 1993, the textile segment contributed 65% of the Company's
consolidated net sales and 47% of the Company's consolidated gross profit.
  Inventories in the textile segment increased by less than $1 million from the
end of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 1993. Inventories of knit textiles and
finished woven textiles decreased. Inventories of woven greige goods increased.

(Earnings (Loss) Per Share bar chart appears here--see appendix)

  Capital expenditures in the textile segment were about $34.4 million during
the fiscal year ended July 3, 1993. The major part of these expenditures was in
the knitted textile area, including the completion of the Rainsford yarn plant
in Edgefield, SC. During the year, the Company closed its two older knit yarn
plants in North Carolina. All of the Company's internally produced yarn for
knitting now comes from its two modern yarn plants in Spartanburg and Edgefield,
SC.
                                                                               7

APPAREL SEGMENT
FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993
  The Company's apparel segment consists of woven and knit branded apparel and
knit apparel sold to screen printers and private label accounts. Net sales in
this segment decreased by $31.1 million to $178.7 million from fiscal 1993 to
fiscal 1994. Sales of branded apparel decreased significantly and sales of
non-branded knit apparel increased slightly. Sales of branded apparel in fiscal
1994 decreased 26% to $95 million as compared to sales in fiscal 1993, with both
unit sales and average unit price being lower in the same comparative period.
Sales of non-branded knit apparel increased 3% to $84 million as compared to
sales in fiscal 1993, with unit sales being higher and average unit price being
slightly lower in the same comparative period.
  Although consumer demand for its "Duck Head" branded apparel remains good, the
Company believes that the delivery problems encountered by its retailer
customers during the rapid growth of the brand in the preceding two fiscal
years were the principal cause of lower sales in the latest fiscal year. The
Company has developed and will install what it believes are better planning and
distribution systems to materially improve its orders shipped to orders received
ratio. In addition, the Company has decided to build a new, central distribution
and office center for the "Duck Head" products. A site has been selected, and
construction will begin in fiscal 1995 and is expected to be completed in early
fiscal 1996. The number of Duck Head retail outlet stores increased from 33 at
the beginning of fiscal 1994 to 36 at present.
  Gross profit margins decreased from 26% in fiscal 1993 to 20% in fiscal 1994.
A gross margin increase in knit apparel was more than offset by decreased gross
margins in branded apparel and outlet store operations. A significant amount of
branded apparel inventories which were carried into fiscal 1994 were sold at
closeout prices and additional reserves were established during fiscal 1994 for
future closeout inventory sales.
  The apparel segment represented 29% of the Company's fiscal 1994 consolidated
net sales and 36% of the Company's fiscal 1994 gross profit.
  The apparel segment's selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal
1994 were $37.1 million as compared to $35.1 million in fiscal 1993. These
expenses were 21% of net sales in fiscal 1994 as compared to 17% for fiscal
1993. Knit apparel selling expenses increased significantly due to efforts to
merchandise and sell a new line of "Nautilus" knit apparel, and the greater
number of outlet stores required additional expenses.
  Other income and expense in the apparel segment included $30.0 million of
charges taken to establish reserves for the Alabama case and certain
restructuring items.
  Fiscal 1994 operating losses for the apparel segment totalled $31.3 million,
including the $30.0 million of other expenses noted above, as compared to
operating profits of $18.9 million in fiscal 1993.
  Inventories in the apparel segment at July 2, 1994 totalled $110.3 million,
compared to $110.0 million at July 3, 1993. Branded apparel inventories fell
slightly and non-branded knit apparel inventories rose slightly during fiscal
1994.
  Capital expenditures in the apparel segment were $3.8 million during fiscal
1994. These repre-
sented improvements in the knitting, fabric finishing, and sewing facilities in
this segment.
   The apparel segment's operating results are highly dependent on orders from
retailers, and from screen printers who supply finished product to retailers.
Generally, when retail sales of apparel are strong, the Company's apparel
segment benefits. The Company cannot be certain when (or if) retail sales of its
product categories will return to growth levels similar to those of the Spring
of 1992.
   This segment's operating results are also dependent upon the utilization of
its owned manufacturing facilities. The Company believes that the internal
capacity utilization by its apparel segment will be satisfactory in fiscal 1995.
   A law suit with allegations similar to those in the Alabama case refered to
above is pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Kentucky brought by an individual who previously served as an independent sales
representative for the Duck Head division. The amount of damages claimed in this
suit has not yet been determined.
FISCAL 1993 VERSUS FISCAL 1992
  Net sales in the apparel segment increased slightly to $209.8 million for the
year ended July 3, 1993 from $206.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Net sales
of woven apparel fell 3% from the fiscal 1992 level while net sales of knit
apparel increased by 9%. Gross sales of "Duck Head" labeled products were
approximately the same in fiscal 1993 as in fiscal 1992. Knit apparel sales were
higher in fiscal 1993 than in fiscal 1992 in both the screen printing and
private label areas.
  Apparel sales for fiscal 1993 were impacted adversely by generally sluggish
retail apparel sales from January to June 1993. The Duck Head retail outlet
operation opened 11 new stores during fiscal 1993, bringing the total at fiscal
year end
8

<PAGE>
to 33 stores with total sales more than twice those in fiscal 1992.
  Gross profit margins in the apparel segment decreased to 26% in fiscal 1993
from 28% in fiscal 1992. Excess inventories of knitted T-shirts throughout the
industry depressed prices for these products. Lower than anticipated "in season"
sales led to higher levels of closeout sales than in the prior fiscal year. "In
season" sales of branded apparel were depressed both by the poor spring weather,
which led to very low levels of reorders for spring season merchandise, and by
generally sluggish retail apparel sales throughout the country.
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $35.1 million in
fiscal 1993 from $29.6 million in fiscal 1992. These costs were 17% of net sales
in fiscal 1993 as compared to 14% in fiscal 1992. Higher advertising costs for
the "Duck Head" brand and costs associated with operating the additional retail
outlet stores were the major factors that caused these increased costs.
  The combination of lower gross profit margins and higher selling, general and
administrative costs as described above led to a 30% decrease in operating
earnings from the apparel segment in fiscal 1993 as compared to fiscal 1992.
  The apparel segment represented 31% of the Company's fiscal 1993 consolidated
net sales and 44% of the Company's fiscal 1993 gross profit.
  Inventories in the apparel segment were $110.0 million at July 3, 1993 as
compared to $90.9 million at June 27, 1992. The major increase occurred in
finished goods inventories of branded apparel, caused by products that had been
acquired in anticipation of higher sales than actually occurred.
  Capital expenditures in the apparel segment were $10.9 million during fiscal
1993. Capital expenditures included improvements in the Maiden, North Carolina
knitting and finishing plant as well as improvements in the segment's sewing
plants in the United States and Costa Rica.

LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL
  During fiscal 1994, the Company financed its operations, capital expenditures,
dividends, and acquisitions primarily through cash generated from operations and
borrowings under its bank credit facility.
  The Company generated cash flows from its operations of $32.8 million, $62.7
million, and $9.6 million for the 1994, 1993, and 1992 fiscal years,
respectively. During these periods, cash generated from operations, and from
sales of the Company's Common Stock, has been used primarily to reduce debt,
finance capital expenditures, including equipment purchases, pay dividends,
acquire 100% of the stock of Nautilus International, Inc., and of Armonia Textil
S.A. (Costa Rica) and its related assets, and 70% of the stock of Apparel
Marketing Corporation, and repurchase approximately 2.3 million shares of the
Company's Common Stock.
  During fiscal 1994, cash used by investing activities included $30.5 million
for purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Fiscal 1994 cash used in
financing activities of $4.5 million resulted primarily from net increases in
bank debt of $32.3 million offset by $9.8 million paid in dividends and $25.3
million used to repurchase the Company's Common Stock. The repurchase of shares
resulted in a lower weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 1994 as
compared to fiscal 1993. The lower number of shares outstanding resulted in a
proportional increase in the loss per share. In addition, borrowings to finance
the repurchase resulted in additional interest expense.
  As of July 2, 1994, the Company had working capital of $242 million, as
compared to $262 million at July 3, 1993. Net accounts receivable were $22.9
million lower, and inventories were $5.5 million higher at the end of fiscal
1994 as compared to balances at the end of fiscal 1993. In addition, current
deferred tax assets were $11.3 million higher, influenced primarily by the
Alabama litigation.
  On September 7, 1994, the Company obtained a $275 million long-term Revolving
Loan Facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility has a limit of $25
million for the purpose of issuing letters of credit, and a separate $29 million
limit for the letter of credit issued in connection with the Alabama litigation
(the "Alabama L/C"). Upon termination of the Alabama L/C, whether by a drawing
or otherwise, this letter of credit facility will expire and the total Credit
Facility will be reduced by the amount of the undrawn and expired portion of the
Alabama L/C. The new Credit Facility will mature on September 30, 1997, with a
provision for one year extensions and (if the extension is made) on each
anniversary of the
                                                                               9

<PAGE>
termination date thereafter, such extension to be available only if consented to
by all of the lenders. The Company's initial interest rate is LIBOR plus .50%
per annum, but the Credit Facility contains provisions that may increase or
decrease the spread over LIBOR depending upon certain financial ratios achieved
by the Company. The Credit Facility is an unsecured general obligation of the
Company. The Company has used the proceeds of the Credit Facility to refinance
the bank debt that existed under its previous credit facilities and to provide
ongoing working capital financing needs.
  At July 2, 1994, borrowings under the Company's loan facilities totaled $160.4
million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.18% per annum as compared to
3.7% at July 3, 1993. Availability under the new Credit Facility is reduced by
outstanding letters of credit, which at July 2, 1994 aggregated approximately
$14.3 million. Certain conditions apply to the Company's ability to borrow under
its Credit Facility, including continued compliance with financial covenants.
See Note D of the accompanying financial statements for a description of loan
covenants.
  The Company spent approximately $29.9 million in capital expenditures during
fiscal 1994. Of this amount, approximately $18 million was spent in the textile
segment with the major expenditures being for consolidation of knitted fabric
manufacturing facilities and weaving machines for the woven fabrics business as
the beginning of its major, long term modernization project. Approximately $4
million was spent in the apparel segment, and approximately $7 million was spent
in the Company's fitness equipment business, largely to rebuild facilities that
were destroyed by fire in March of 1993.
  During fiscal 1995, the Company plans to spend approximately $45 million for
capital improvements and new equipment. The majority of this amount is expected
to be spent in continuing the woven fabrics modernization program. The Company
also expects to begin construction of a new, centralized distribution center for
its branded apparel division in fiscal 1995. The Company believes that its
equipment and facilities are generally adequate to allow it to remain
competitive with its principal competitors.
  The Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to five
million shares of the Company's outstanding Common Stock at prices and at times
at the discretion of the Company's top management. During fiscal 1994, the
Company repurchased and retired approximately 2.3 million shares at a total cost
of approximately $25.3 million. These purchases were funded by use of the
Company's revolving credit line. The Company currently has approximately 24.2
million shares outstanding.
  The Company believes that cash flow generated by its operations and funds
available under its existing credit lines should be sufficient to service its
bank debt, to satisfy its day-to-day working capital needs, to fund its planned
capital expenditures and to continue the payment of dividends.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
  The Company's Nautilus business has been named as a "potentially responsible
party" ("PRP") under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to three sites in North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Mississippi. To the Company's knowledge, all of the transactions
with these sites were conducted by a corporation (the "Selling Corporation")
whose assets were sold in 1990 pursuant to the terms of an order of the United
States Bankruptcy Court to another corporation, the stock of which was
subsequently acquired by the Company in January 1993.
  At the North Carolina site, the Company's information is that there are over
1,400 PRPs and the Selling Corporation is listed as a "de minimis" party. The
Company's most recent information indicates that the Selling Corporation's share
of the costs of the surface removal action (the removal of drums, equipment and
materials) for this site will be immaterial. The Company does not currently have
information respecting the soil and groundwater cleanup costs that may be
incurred with respect to this site.
  At the South Carolina site, there are over 700 PRPs, and the Selling
Corporation has been listed as an "insolvent" party and would appear to qualify
as a "de minimis" party. The site's PRP group has completed a surface removal
action, the Selling Corporation's part of which is immaterial. The PRP group is
investigating soil and groundwater contamination at the site, but there is
currently insufficient information available to estimate the cost of remediating
that contamination.
  At the Mississippi site, the PRP Group is in the process of performing a
surface removal action and is investigating soil and groundwater contamination,
both at the site and in the surrounding area. The Company's latest information
is that the Selling Corporation is ranked 11th out of a total of over 300 PRPs
in contributions of material to the site, and, based on volume, the Selling
Corporation contributed approximately 3% of the site's material. To the
Company's knowledge, latest estimates of costs to clean up the site range up to
$4 million. Trichloroethane, one of the substances delivered by the Selling
Corporation to the site, has been found in the site's groundwater and at nearby
residential drinking water wells.
  Although no assurance can be provided, the Company believes that it is
shielded from liability
10

<PAGE>
at these three sites by the order of the United States Bankruptcy Court pursuant
to which the Selling Corporation sold its assets to the corporation subsequently
acquired by the Company.
  The Company, therefore, has denied any responsibility at the sites
and has declined to participate as a member of the respective PRP groups.
Accordingly, the Company has not provided for any reserves for costs or
liabilities attributable to the Selling Corporation.
INCOME TAXES
  The effective income tax rates for the 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years were
33.3%, 39.5%, and 39%, respectively. As of June 28, 1992, the Company changed
its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the
liability method required by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting For Income
Taxes" (see Note F of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The
cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of June 28, 1992 was to decrease
fiscal 1993 net income by approximately $875,000, which is reflected in the
effective rate above for that year.
  The Company made income tax payments of approximately $2,350,000, $20,171,000
and $19,678,000 during the 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years, respectively. In
fiscal 1992, the Company utilized alternative minimum tax credits of $4.4
million generated in fiscal years 1989, 1990 and 1991 to reduce its fiscal 1992
tax liability. In addition, the Company utilized in fiscal 1992 $225,000 of
business credit carryforwards which were acquired in the Stanwood acquisition.
  During fiscal 1993, the IRS concluded its audit of the Company's consolidated
tax returns for fiscal years 1988 and 1989 with no material adjustments.
  Prior to its acquisition by the company, O'Bryan Brothers Inc. (which owned
the "Duck Head" trademarks) had established for income tax purposes the basis of
customer lists in the amount of $3.6 million. The IRS had audited this matter
for years prior to inclusion in the consolidated federal income tax return of
the Company and had originally disallowed the deduction of this basis. During
fiscal 1994, the IRS and the Company agreed to settle this issue which resulted
in approximately $149,000 of tax due. This tax settlement has been considered in
the above effective tax rate for 1994.
  In fiscal 1994, the Company paid alternative minimum tax ("AMT") of
approximately $2 million. To the extent that the Company pays AMT, it can later
apply the AMT previously paid as a credit against future regular tax
liabilities.
  At July 2, 1994, the Company had net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of
$11.1 million for income tax purposes that expire in fiscal years 1995 through
2003. Approximately, $1.9 million of these carryforwards is attributable to a
company acquired in 1986. This carryover will expire in fiscal years ending in
1995 and 1996.
  The remaining carryover of approximately $9.2 million was generated by a
subsidiary of Stanwood Corporation, which was acquired by the Company during its
1989 fiscal year. The total net operating loss carryforward of the Stanwood
group at the time of acquisition amounted to $10.9 million of which $1.7 million
was utilized by the Company in its fiscal 1991 tax return. In addition to net
operating loss carryforwards, at the time of acquisition, Stanwood Corporation
had general business credit carryforwards which totalled $835,000 and expire
June 1999 through June 2003. The business credit carryforward at the end of
fiscal 1994 from this acquisition was approximately $610,000.
  Although the Tax Reform Act of 1986 placed annual limitations on utilizing
NOLs and tax credits from companies which have changed ownership, this should
not impact the Company's ability to ultimately utilize the carryovers. The
maximum annual usage of the Stanwood NOL is limited by applicable provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code to approximately $1 million per year. The Company
expects to utilize the Stanwood NOL prior to the expiration dates of June 2002
and June 2003.
  The Company has recognized cumulative deferred tax assets of approximately $28
million, arising principally from litigation accruals, basis differences between
the recorded value for financial reporting purposes and tax basis of fixed
assets, net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards of acquired
companies and book accruals which will be future tax deductions. Such deferred
tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance of approximately $3.9
million. The valuation allowance will be adjusted from time to time as the tax
benefits are realized. Although the Company's business is cyclical, its history
of generating taxable income indicates it is likely that the Company will be
able to realize its deferred tax assets.
  Although the Company believes that it has been, and will continue to be,
entitled to utilize the NOLs, credit carryovers and basis differences described
above, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not be able to successfully
challenge any such items on the grounds that they were not validly incurred for
Federal income tax purposes or that their use is restricted by various tax
provisions.
                                                                              11

OPERATIONS BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT
  The Company operates principally in two segments: textiles and apparel. The
textile segment's principal products are woven and knitted fabrics for apparel
and home furnishings manufacturers. The apparel segment is the manufacturer of
the "Duck Head" brand of casualwear, completed T-shirts, fleece goods and
sportswear, and includes a retail apparel business. The apparel segment sells
primarily to department stores and other apparel retailers. The Company also
manufactures and sells Nautilus fitness equipment primarily to the institutional
market.

  The textile segment sells to the apparel segment at a rate approximately 1%
over cost. All other intersegment sales are at prices comparable to unaffiliated
customers sales. Intersegment operating profit related to the intersegment sales
is not significant. Operating profit is total revenue less operating expenses,
excluding interest expense, corporate expense and interest income. Included in
1993 operating profit is a net gain on an involuntary conversion in the fitness
equipment division. (See Note K).
  During fiscal 1994 the apparel segment recognized a charge of $27 million in
connection with a law suit, and the textile, apparel and office products and
other divisions recorded restructuring charges of $1,700,000, $2,900,000, and
$4,600,000, respectively. Depreciation and amortization include certain
writedowns of property and equipment
  Identifiable assets are those assets that are used in the operations of each
segment. Amounts shown for corporate assets consist principally of corporate
office equipment, deferred loan costs and certain life insurance policies. (See
Note H). Capital expenditures include related accounts payable of $1,010,000,
$1,694,000 and $6,610,000 for the 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years,
respectively.

        REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
        BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
        DELTA WOODSIDE INDUSTRIES, INC.
        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
        sheets of Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. as of July 2,
        1994 and July 3, 1993, and the related consolidated
        statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
        flows for each of the three years in the period ended July
        2, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility
        of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
        express an opinion on these financial statements based on
        our audits.
        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
        accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
        we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
        assurance about whether the financial statements are free
        of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
        in the financial statements. An audit also includes
        assessing the accounting principles used and significant
        estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
        overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
        our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
        present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
        financial position of Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. at
        July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, and the consolidated results
        of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
        years in the period ended, in conformity with generally
        accepted accounting principles.
                                         (Signature of Ernst & Young LLP)
        Greenville, South Carolina
        August 17, 1994, except for
          the third paragraph of Note D,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Delta Woodside Industries, Inc.
NOTE A -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries
(all of which are wholly-owned, except for Apparel Marketing Corporation which
is 70% owned). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Certain amounts for the 1993 fiscal year end have been reclassified
to conform to the 1994 presentation.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. As of July
2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, cost for certain inventories of the apparel segment
are determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method representing 35% and
32%, respectively, of the cost of consolidated inventories. The balance of the
cost of consolidated inventories is determined under the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method. If the inventories of the apparel segment had been determined by
the FIFO method, they would have been approximately the same as the reported
amounts.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated on the
basis of cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method for
financial reporting based on estimated useful lives of three to thirty-two
years, and by accelerated methods for income tax reporting.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recorded upon shipment or designation of specific
goods for later shipment at customers' request with related risk of ownership
passing to such customers.
AMORTIZATION: Amortization is computed using the straight-line method. The
excess of cost over assigned value of net assets acquired relating to certain
business combinations is being amortized to expense over periods of 5, 15 or 40
years. The excess of assigned value of net assets acquired over cost relating to
other business combinations is being amortized to income over 5 and 40 years.
Loan acquisition costs are being amortized over 3 years. Other intangible assets
are being amortized over periods of 3 to 40 years.
INCOME TAXES: The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," which required a change from the deferred method to the liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income
taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary differences" by
applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing
assets and liabilities. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. Under the deferred method, deferred taxes were recognized using
the tax rate applicable to the year of the calculation and were not adjusted for
subsequent changes in tax rates.
The Company adopted SFAS 109 in the first quarter of fiscal 1993 and reported
the cumulative effect on the change in method of accounting for income taxes as
of the beginning of the 1993 fiscal year. Net income was reduced by $875,000 as
a result of the cumulative effect adjustment resulting from the change in
accounting for income tax expense.
CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid investments of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Per share data are computed based on the weighted
average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each period.
Unallocated shares in the Company's Retirement Plan are not considered
outstanding.
FISCAL YEAR: The Company's operations are based on a fifty-two, fifty-three week
fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to June 30. The 1994 and 1992 fiscal
years consist of 52 weeks, whereas the 1993 fiscal year was 53 weeks.
                                                                              21

NOTE B -- ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES
On January 20, 1993, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Nautilus International, Inc., parent company of Nautilus Acquisition
Corporation, a manufacturer of fitness equipment. Concurrent with this
acquisition, the Company acquired 70% of the stock of Apparel Marketing
Corporation which owns the apparel and related accessory licensing rights to the
Nautilus name. These acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase method
of accounting, and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the operations of the acquired businesses from the dates of their respective
acquisitions. The total purchase price for the stock acquired in these two
transactions was approximately $9.1 million. An additional $11.4 million was
paid to retire indebtedness of Nautilus. The total cost of the acquisitions
amounted to approximately $20.5 million. The cost exceeded the fair value of net
assets acquired by approximately $4.9 million, which has been recorded as
goodwill and is being amortized over 40 years for Nautilus International and 5
years for Apparel Marketing Corporation. The following unaudited pro forma
summary presents the consolidated results of operations as if the acquisitions
had occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented.

</TABLE>

In addition, the Company acquired certain other immaterial businesses during
both fiscal 1994 and 1993.
NOTE C -- ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The woven fabrics operation assigns a substantial portion of its trade accounts
receivable to a bank under a factor agreement. The assignment of these
receivables is primarily without recourse, provided that customer orders are
approved by the bank prior to shipment of goods, up to a maximum for each
individual account. At July 2, 1994 the Company had no significant
concentrations of
credit risk, since substantially all of the Company's accounts receivable are
due from many companies that produce apparel, home furnishings and other
products and from department stores and specialty apparel retailers located
throughout the United States. The Company generally does not require collateral
for its accounts receivable.

</TABLE>

Certain property, plant and equipment with a net book value of approximately
$13,882,000 is collateral for certain long-term debt of $1,551,000 at July 2,
1994.
At July 2, 1994 the company had an unsecured revolving credit facility for $175
million and two additional bank credit lines that aggregated $75 million. The
Company's loan covenants generally limited the Company's total indebtedness to
$225 million, plus an amount required to fund the Alabama jury award. See Note
J. At July 2, 1994 outstanding letters of credit of $14,332,000 issued to
certain suppliers and not included in the accompanying financial statements
reduced the unused portion of the facility to $50,316,000. Interest on the short
term facility was based on a bank's floating CD rate.
On September 7, 1994 the Company obtained a $275 million unsecured Revolving
Loan Facility. The new Credit Facility has a limit of $25 million for the
purpose of issuing letters of credit and a separate limit of $29 million for the
letter of credit issued in connection with certain litigation. The new Credit
Facility will mature on September 30, 1997, with a provision for one year
extensions. The Company's initial interest rate is LIBOR plus .5%, but the
Credit Facility contains provisions that may increase or decrease the spread
over LIBOR depending upon certain financial ratios achieved by the Company. The
Company used the proceeds of the new Credit Facility to refinance its revolving
credit facility and a note payable, accordingly, these have been classified as
long-term.
The new long-term revolving credit facility contains various restrictive
covenants requiring minimum tangible net worth and certain other minimum
financial ratios. The agreement also restricts additional indebtedness,
dividends and capital expenditures. The Company is permitted, absent a default,
to pay cash dividends up to $25 million. At July 2, 1994 the minimum tangible
net worth requirement under the new credit facility would have limited available
dividends to $7.6 million.
Total interest expense incurred by the Company was $8,639,000, $8,005,000 and
$11,807,000 in the 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years, respectively, of which
approximately $230,000 and $328,000 was capitalized in fiscal 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Total interest paid during the 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years
was $8,275,000, $9,012,000 and $12,234,000, respectively.
Rent expense relating to operating leases was approximately $5,617,000 (1994),
$5,235,000 (1993) and $4,292,000 (1992). Future minimum payments under
noncancelable operating leases with initial terms of one year or more for the
five fiscal years ended after July 2, 1994 are: $3,783,000 (1995), $2,889,000
(1996), $2,563,000 (1997), $1,896,000 (1998) and $1,319,000 (1999).
Assets recorded under capital leases are included in property, plant and
equipment. Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation.
Aggregate principal maturities of all long-term debt and minimum payments under
capital leases are as follows:

NOTE E -- SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
During the first six months of fiscal 1994 the Company repurchased 2,296,000
shares of Common Stock for $25.3 million. In October 1991, the Company sold
5,175,000 shares of Common Stock in a public offering resulting in net proceeds
of $113 million. Proceeds from the sale of Common Stock were used to reduce debt
under the Company's lines of credit. Registration costs of $404,000 were charged
to additional paid-in capital. Had the October 1991 sale of Common Stock and
corresponding repayment of borrowings occurred as of the beginning of the 1992
fiscal year, unaudited pro forma earnings per share for fiscal 1992 would have
been $1.59.
During fiscal 1991 the shareholders approved a new Incentive Stock Award Plan
and a Stock Option Plan. Each of the plans gives the Company the right to grant
awards or options for up to 300,000 shares of Common Stock to employees. The
Board of Directors intends to seek authorization to award additional shares
under the Incentive Stock Award Plan in the annual shareholders' meeting in the
Fall of 1995.
Transactions under the Stock Option Plan are as follows:

</TABLE>

The average exercise price for all options outstanding was $5.13 per share at
July 2, 1994. These options expire on various dates beginning November 17, 1995
and ending on December 12, 1997. The options generally become exercisable in
equal amounts on the first through fourth anniversaries of the date of grant and
remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. The excess
of the fair market value over the exercise price at the date of grant is
recognized as compensation expense over the period during which the options
become exercisable. Related compensation expense was $232,000, $186,000 and
$110,000 during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Under the 1991 Incentive Stock Award Plan, awards for the right to purchase for
$.01 per share up to 260,581 shares, 4,164 shares and 14,303 shares were granted
to certain management and key employees during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The shares granted during fiscal 1994 in excess of shares
available are contingent upon shareholder approval. Generally, each award vests
based in part on service and in part on achievement of certain performance goals
over a three-year period. Compensation expense for the service portion is based
on the market price of the stock on the date of award. Compensation expense for
the performance portion is based on the prevailing market price of the stock.
Tax benefits arising from the difference in market value between the date of
grant and the date of issuance of common stock are recorded as an adjustment to
additional paid-in capital. Compensation expense for the Company's incentive
stock award plan including related tax assistance was $1,111,000, $561,000 and
$971,000 for the fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Shares
available for grant were 113,813, and 113,937 at July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992,
respectively.
During November 1991 the shareholders authorized the Board of Directors to issue
up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a maximum aggregate par value of
$250,000,000. The Board of Directors was also authorized to establish the
particular terms including dividend rates, conversion prices, voting rights,
redemption prices and similar matters.

NOTE F -- INCOME TAXES
Effective June 28, 1992 the Company changed its method of accounting for income
taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As permitted under the new
rules, prior years' financial statements were not restated. The cumulative
effect of adopting Statement 109 as of June 28, 1992 was to decrease fiscal 1993
net income by approximately $875,000.
The Company paid alternative minimum tax ("AMT") of approximately $2 million for
fiscal 1994 since its AMT liability was greater than its regular tax liability.
To the extent that the Company pays AMT, it can later apply the AMT previously
paid as a credit against regular tax liabilities. The Company expects to utilize
future AMT credits as taxable income increases and current temporary differences
reverse.
At July 2, 1994, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $11.1
million for income tax purposes that expire in years 1995 through 2003. Those
carryforwards resulted from the Company's 1986 acquisition of certain companies
from J.P. Stevens & Co., Inc. and from the 1988 acquisition of Stanwood
Corporation. In addition to net operating loss carryforwards, at the time of
acquisition, Stanwood Corporation had general business credit carryforwards
which totalled $835,000. The Company utilized $225,000 of these general business
credit carryforwards in its fiscal 1992 federal income tax return. The remaining
business credit carryforwards will expire in fiscal years ending 1999 through
2003. The Company expects the net operating loss remaining from the Stanwood
acquisition of $9.2 million and general business credit carryforwards of
$610,000 will be utilized prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance of $3.5 million was
recognized in fiscal 1993 to offset the deferred tax assets recorded related to
those carryforwards. When realized, the tax benefits for a portion of those
items will be applied to reduce goodwill related to business acquisitions.
During fiscal 1994 the valuation allowance increased by $286,000 for the tax
effect of Apparel Marketing's current year net operating loss, and by $86,000
for the increase in tax rates.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial statement amounts and amounts used for income tax
purposes. Deferred income taxes also reflect the increase in the federal tax
rate from 34% to 35%.
Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are
as follows:

The Company made income tax payments of approximately $2,350,000, $20,171,000,
and $19,678,000 during the 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years, respectively.
NOTE G -- OPERATIONS BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT
Industry segment information for the Company presented on pages 12 and 13 of
this Annual Report is an integral part of these financial statements.
NOTE H -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Under the terms of the Delta Woodside Industries Employee Retirement Plan, the
Board of Directors has the discretion to authorize contributions from time to
time to the Retirement Plan of cash or a maximum of 504,790 shares of the
Company's Common Stock. A trustee holds the assets of the Retirement Plan for
the benefit of the participants who may withdraw amounts or shares only upon
retirement, death, disability or other termination of employment. All employees
of the Company who are at least 21 years of age with one year of service
participate in the Retirement Plan. Amounts allocated to participant accounts
generally vest over a five-year period. Each participant has the right to direct
the trustee as to the manner in which shares held are to be voted. The
Retirement Plan qualifies as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") under the
Internal Revenue Code as a defined contribution plan.
The Company's 1994, 1993 and 1992 contributions allocated to participants were
$363,000, $1,581,000 and $2,303,000, respectively. The 1994 and 1993
contributions were made in cash and the 1992 contribution included both cash
contributions and allocations of stock purchased with excess funds the
Retirement Plan received from terminated defined benefit plans the Company
acquired in a business acquisition in fiscal 1989.
The Company maintains a 401(k) employee savings and investment plan for
employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The Company made no
contributions to the plan for any year presented.
In April 1989, the Company established a 501(c)(9) trust, the Delta Woodside
Employee Benefit Plan and Trust ("Trust"). The Trust collects both employer and
employee contributions from the Company and makes disbursements for health
claims and other qualified benefits.
The Company has a Deferred Compensation Plan which permits certain management
employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Deferred compensation
accounts are credited with interest and are distributable after retirement,
disability or employment termination. As of July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993, the
total liability amounted to $4,428,000 and $3,496,000, respectively. The Company
insured the lives of certain management employees to assist in funding of the
deferred compensation liability. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of the
insurance policies.
NOTE I -- AFFILIATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company leases its corporate and other office space from a corporation whose
stock is owned one-third each by the president and a vice president of the
Company. Additional office space and retail store space is leased from the
executive vice president. Certain of these leases are on a monthly basis with
others expiring in 1997. Under the leases, the Company made payments of
approximately $292,000, $226,000, and $137,000 for the 1994, 1993 and 1992
fiscal years, respectively.

NOTE J -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
During fiscal 1995 the Company plans to spend approximately $45 million for
capital improvements and new equipment. About three-quarters of this amount is
expected to be incurred in the continuation of the modernization program for the
woven fabrics division of the Company's textile segment. The remainder of the
fiscal 1995 capital expenditures are planned to include the start of
construction on the "Duck Head" central distribution center, and various other
projects across all of the Company's business segments. The Company believes
that its facilities and equipment are adequate to allow it to remain competitive
with its primary competitors.

In fiscal 1994, the Company charged income for $27.1 million to establish a
reserve for a judgment entered by an Alabama court in connection with a jury
award made on November 24, 1993 in favor of a former independent sales
representative of a subsidiary of the Company and two of his assistants,
interest costs on that judgement, and related legal expenses in connection with
the appeals process. The appeal is now before the Alabama Supreme Court.

During fiscal 1994, the Company made certain decisions
regarding its operations which resulted in a restructuring charge. These
decisions included restructuring charges of $3.2 million for the sale of the
office products business, $1.3 million to abandon plans to develop a spinning
plant building and $2.4 million in the apparel segment to discontinue a women's
line of apparel and consolidate distribution operations. These restructuring
decisions include write-downs of $1.6 million of goodwill and $2.1 of property
plant and equipment. At July 2, 1994, $2.4 million remain in accrued liabilities
related primarily to leases on vacant facilities and other future costs of the
restructuring plan.
Prior to its acquisition by the Company, O'Bryan Brothers, Inc. had established
for income tax purposes the basis of customer lists in the amount of $3.6
million. The Internal Revenue Service had audited this matter for the years
prior to inclusion in the consolidated federal tax return of the Company and had
disallowed the deduction of this basis. The full amount of the customer list was
deducted by June 29, 1991. The Company appealed the disallowance. In April,
1994, the Internal Revenue Service offered a choice between two options to the
Company in an attempt to settle this case. The Company could also have chosen to
remain in the appeals process. After analyzing its options, the Company chose
one of the settlement options offered by the Internal Revenue Service. The
effect of choosing this option had no material effect on the Company's results.

The Company's Nautilus business has been named as a "potentially responsible
party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act with respect to three hazardous waste sites. To the Company's
knowledge, all of the transactions with these sites were conducted by a
corporation whose assets were sold in 1990 pursuant to the terms of an order of
the United States Bankruptcy Court to another corporation, the stock of which
was subsequently acquired by the Company in January 1993. The Company,
therefore, has denied any responsibility at the sites and has declined to
participate in any settlements. Accordingly, the Company has not provided for
any reserves for costs or liabilities attributable to the previous corporation.
At two sites the previous company is listed as a "de minimis" party. At the
third site the previous company is ranked eleventh out of a total of over 300
potentially responsible parties based on the company's volume of contribution of
about 3%. Latest estimates of the cost to clean up the site range up to $4
million. Although there is uncertainty as to several legal issues, the Company
believes that it has certain defenses to liability at these sites.
Based on the information currently known to it, the Company does not believe
that the potential liabilities arising from these three sites will have a
materially adverse impact on the Company.

A law suit with allegations similar to those in the Alabama case refered to
above is pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Kentucky brought by an individual who previously served as an independent sales
representative for the Duck Head division. The amount of damages claimed in this
suit has not yet been determined.

From time to time the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in legal
actions involving claims arising in the normal course of business, including
product liability claims. The Company believes that, as a result of legal
defenses, insurance arrangements and indemnification provisions with parties
believed to be financially capable, none of these actions should have a material
effect on its operations or financial condition.
                                                                              27

</TABLE>

During the second quarter of fiscal 1994 the Company recorded charges of $33
million for a lawsuit and $12.7 million for restructuring. The litigation charge
was reduced to $27.1 million during the third quarter and the restructuring
charge was reduced to $9.2 million during the fourth quarter due principally to
a change in estimate related to the sale of the office products business.
Included in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 is a pretax gain of $2,487,000
arising from insurance proceeds related to a fire at the Nautilus plant in March
1993.
The Company made certain adjustments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994
resulting from changes in estimates that were material to the results of
operations. The aggregate effect of the adjustments after applicable income
taxes was an increase in net income of $2,432,000.
