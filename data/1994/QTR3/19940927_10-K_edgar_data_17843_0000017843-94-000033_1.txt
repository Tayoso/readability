                                  PART I

Item 1.   Business

     (a)  General Development of Business:

          Carpenter Technology Corporation, incorporated in
     1904, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the
     manufacture, fabrication, and marketing of specialty
     metals and structural ceramics.  There were no
     significant changes in the form of organization or mode
     of conducting business of Carpenter Technology
     Corporation (hereinafter called the Company) during the
     year ended June 30, 1994, except for the transactions
     described below:

          On July 28, 1993, the Company purchased all of the
          capital stock (the "Stock") of Aceros Fortuna, S.A. de
          C.V. and two related companies ("Fortuna").  Fortuna is
          the largest distributor of specialty steel long
          products (those in bar, rod, wire or strip forms) in
          Mexico.  Fortuna also operates a heat treatment
          facility and a leasing company, in Mexico City.  The
          purchase price for the Stock was $20.4 million.  In
          addition, the Company paid $2.5 million for agreements
          not to compete and paid acquisition costs.  This
          investment is being accounted for using the purchase
          method of accounting.

          On September 2, 1993, the Company acquired for $45.0
          million in cash, 19 percent of the shares of
          Walsin-CarTech Specialty Steel Corporation, a joint
          venture with Walsin Lihwa Corporation in Taiwan.  The
          joint venture has constructed a facility and installed
          equipment in this facility in Taiwan to manufacture and
          distribute specialty steel.  Initial production trial
          runs of steel began in July 1994.  The Company has an
          option to acquire up to an additional 16 percent of the
          outstanding shares of the joint venture from Walsin
          Lihwa at any time until July 1, 1996.  Alternatively,
          the Company may require Walsin Lihwa to purchase its 19
          percent ownership for the original purchase cost at any
          time up to July 1, 1997.  This investment is being
          accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

          In addition, on July 22, 1994, the Company acquired all
     of the outstanding shares of Certech, Inc. and an affiliated
     company (Certech), for $16.0 million comprised of $12.8
     million in cash and the balance in shares of Carpenter
     common stock.  Certech, with plants in New Jersey,
     Pennsylvania and the United Kingdom had sales of about $17
     million in fiscal 1994.  It is a recognized leader in the
     technology and manufacturing of structural ceramic products.

     The acquisition of Certech enabled the Company to quickly
     attain a substantial position in the structural ceramics
     market.

     (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments:

          The Company is primarily engaged in one business
     segment, the manufacture, fabrication and marketing of
     specialty metals.  

     (c)  Narrative Description of Business:

          (1)  Products:

               The Company processes basic raw materials such as
          chromium, nickel, iron scrap and other metal alloying
          elements through various melting, hot forming and cold
          working facilities to produce finished products in the
          form of billet, bar, rod, wire, narrow strip, special
          shapes, and hollow forms in many sizes and finishes. 
          Sales of finished products include:  

          STAINLESS STEELS - 
               A broad range of corrosion resistant alloys
               including conventional stainless steels and many
               proprietary grades for special applications.  

          SPECIAL ALLOYS - 
               Other special purpose alloys used in critical
               components such as bearings and fasteners.  Heat
               resistant alloys that range from slight
               modifications of the stainless steels to complex
               nickel and cobalt base alloys.  Alloys for
               electronic, magnetic and electrical applications
               with controlled thermal expansion characteristics,
               or high electrical resistivity or special magnetic
               characteristics.  Special stainless steels and
               zirconium base alloys for nuclear reactors.  

          TOOL STEELS - 
               Tool and die steels which are extremely hard
               alloys used for tooling and other wear-resisting
               components in metalworking operations such as
               stamping, extrusion and machining.  

          OTHER -
               Carbon steels purchased for distribution and other
               miscellaneous products.

               The products of the Company are sold primarily in
          the United States and principally through its own sales
          organization with service centers and sales offices
          located in many of the major cities of the country. 
          Sales outside of the United States, including export sales,
          were $67.1 million, $30.7 million and $33.9 million in 
          fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

<PAGE>
          
          (2)  Classes of Products:

               The approximate percentage of the Company's
          consolidated net sales contributed by the major classes
          of products for the last three fiscal years are as
          follows: 

                                   1994      1993      1992
                                   ----      ----      ----

                                   ====      ====      ====
          (3)  Raw Materials:

               The Company depends on continued delivery of
          critical raw materials for its day-to-day operations. 
          These raw materials are nickel, ferrochrome, cobalt,
          molybdenum, manganese and scrap, both alloy and steel. 
          Some of these raw materials sources are located in
          countries subject to potential interruptions of supply.

          These potential interruptions could cause material
          shortages and affect the availability and price.

               The Company is in a strong raw material position
          because of its long-term relationships with major
          suppliers.  These suppliers provide material
          availability and competitive prices for these key raw
          materials.

               The Company has also established and maintains raw
          material inventory at appropriate levels at the Reading
          plant.  These raw materials inventory levels are
          balanced to meet inventory targets while maintaining
          continued operations during potential periods of
          disruption.

          (4)  Patents and Licenses:

               The Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates
          own a number of United States and foreign patents and
          have granted licenses under some or all of them. 
          Certain of the products produced by the Company are
          covered by patents of other companies from whom
          licenses have been obtained.  The Company does not
          consider its business to be materially dependent upon
          any patent or patent rights.

<PAGE>
         

          (5)  Seasonality of Business:

               The Company's sales and earnings results are
          normally influenced by seasonal factors.  The first
          fiscal quarter (three months ending September 30) is
          typically the lowest - chiefly because of annual plant
          vacation shutdowns in this period by the Company as
          well as by many of its customers.  The timing of major
          changes in the general economy can alter this pattern,
          but over the longer time frame, the historical patterns
          generally prevail.  The chart below shows the percent
          of net sales by quarters for the past three fiscal
          years:  

                                        1994      1993      1992
                                        ----      ----      ----
          Quarter Ended September 30     21%       24%       22%
          Quarter Ended December 31      23%       21%       23%
          Quarter Ended March 31         28%       27%       29%
          Quarter Ended June 30          28%       28%       26%
                                        ----      ----      ----
                                        100%      100%      100%
                                        ====      ====      ====
          (6)  Customers:

               The Company is not dependent upon a single
          customer, or a very few customers, to the extent that
          the loss of any one or more would have a materially
          adverse effect on the Company.  

          (7)  Backlog:

               As of August 31, 1994, the Company had a backlog
          of orders, believed to be firm, of approximately $196.0
          million, substantially all of which is expected to be
          shipped within the current fiscal year.  The backlog as
          of August 31, 1993 was approximately $122.0 million.

          (8)  Competition:

               The business of the Company is highly competitive.  
          There are 14 major domestic companies producing one or
          more similar specialty metal products in competition
          with the Company.  Furthermore, a number of different
          products may, in certain instances, be substituted for
          the Company's finished product.  Additionally, numerous
          foreign producers import into the United States various
          specialty metal products similar to those produced by
          the Company.  Imports of foreign specialty steels have
          long been a serious concern to the domestic steel
          industry because of the potential for unfair pricing by
          foreign producers.  Such pricing practices have usually
          been supported by foreign governments through direct
          and indirect subsidies.  

<PAGE>

               The Voluntary Restraint Arrangements (VRA's)
          limiting the volume of foreign specialty steel products
          which could be exported to the United States expired as
          scheduled in 1992.  The U.S. Government chose not to
          extend the VRA's, leaving the domestic producers with
          the alternative of filing unfair trade actions against
          foreign specialty steel producers.
     
               In January 1994, the International Trade
          Commission (ITC) ruled that the domestic industry had
          been injured by dumped stainless steel rod imports from
          Brazil, France and India and the U.S. Department of
          Commerce issued dumping orders against the three
          countries targeted.  As a result, additional duties
          will be collected at margins ranging from 24.6% to
          26.5% against Brazil, 24.59% against France and 48.8%
          against India on all imports of stainless steel rod
          from those countries.
     
               On December 30, 1993, the Company joined with six
          other domestic producers in filing new antidumping
          actions against imports of stainless steel bar from
          Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain.  In
          February 1994, the ITC determined that there was a
          preliminary indication of injury and, on July 28, 1994,
          the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a preliminary
          dumping determination against the five countries, with
          margins ranging up to 61%.  As a result, importers are
          required to post bonds on cash deposits covering the
          amounts of the potential additional duties.  The final
          determinations of dumping and injury are expected by
          the end of calendar 1994.
     
               Negotiations by the U.S. Trade Representative with
          the major steel producing nations of the world to
          develop a Multilateral Steel Agreement (MSA) are
          continuing.  The objective of the MSA would be to
          reduce unfair trade in steel products by establishing
          international commitments and disciplines aimed at
          eliminating subsidies and other trade-distortive
          practices.  

          (9)  Research, Product and Process Development: 

               The Company's expenditures for company-sponsored
          research and development were approximately $13.6
          million, $12.9 million and $14.0 million in fiscal
          1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

<PAGE>
         
          (10) Environmental Regulations:

               The Company, as well as other steel companies, is
          subject to various stringent federal, state, and local
          environmental laws and regulations.  The liability for
          future environmental remediation costs is evaluated on
          a quarterly basis by management.  The Company accrues
          amounts for environmental remediation costs which
          represent management's best estimate of the probable
          and reasonably estimable costs relating to environ-
          mental remediation.  For further information on
          environmental remediation, see the Commitments and
          Contingencies section included in Item 7 "Management's
          Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations" and Note 16 to the financial
          statements included in Item 8 "Financial Statements and
          Supplementary Data".

               The costs of maintaining and operating environ-
          mental control equipment were about $8.5 million and
          $8.2 million for fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
          The capital expenditures for environmental control
          equipment were about $.5 million and $2.6 million for
          fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company
          anticipates spending approximately $15.0 million on
          major domestic environmental capital projects over the
          next five fiscal years.  Due to the possibility of
          unanticipated factual or regulatory developments, the
          amount of future capital expenditures may vary.

          (11) Employees:  

               As of August 31, 1994, the Company had 4,085 full-
          time employees.  

Item 2.  Properties

     The locations of the Company's principal manufacturing
plants are: Reading, Pennsylvania; Orangeburg, South Carolina;
and San Diego, California.  The Reading and Orangeburg plants are
owned in fee.  The San Diego plant is owned, but the land is
leased.

     The Company has an annual practical melting capacity of
approximately 208,000 ingot tons of its normal product mix.  The
annual tons shipped will be considerably less than the tons
melted due to finishing losses.  During the years ended June 30,
1994 and 1993, the Company operated at approximately 78 percent 
and 70 percent, respectively, of its melting capacity due to 
significant reductions in its finished and process inventories.

     The Company also operates sales offices and service centers,
most of which are owned, at 35 locations in 15 states and 8
foreign countries.  

<PAGE>
     
     The plants, service centers and offices of the Company have
been acquired at various times over many years.  There is an
active maintenance program to keep facilities in good condition. 
In addition, the Company has had an active capital spending
program to replace equipment as needed to keep it technologically
competitive on a world-wide basis.  The Company believes its
facilities are in good condition and suitable for its business

__________________________________________________________________

Fiscal 1994 and 1992 results were adversely affected by
extraordinary charges for debt retirement as described in Note 7
to the financial statements.  Fiscal 1993 results were reduced by
a large, one-time retroactive charge for the cumulative effect of
adopting two accounting changes as described in Note 1 to the
financial statements.

Earnings before the extraordinary charges and accounting changes
improved in each of the past two years as a result of the
improved economy and internal programs for cost reduction, asset
utilization and market share enhancements.

The chart below shows net sales by product line for the past
three fiscal years:

Results of Operations - Fiscal 1994 Versus Fiscal 1993

Sales were $628.8 million in fiscal 1994, up 9 percent from the
fiscal 1993 level of $576.2 million.  Approximately 60 percent of
the increase was from the inclusion, in fiscal 1994, of the
results of Aceros Fortuna, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican steel
distribution company, which was acquired in July 1993 (described
in Note 2 to the financial statements).

The remainder of the sales improvement was due to an 8 percent
increase in unit volume shipments of the Steel Division.  Demand
for stainless bar and wire products was at a high level,
especially in the January to June 1994 period.  Also, mill-direct
business in commodity-priced products was accepted to more fully
utilize production capability.  This strategy and reduced sales
of high temperature alloys for the aerospace industry resulted in
a lower-priced sales mix.  Unit selling prices for domestic
specialty steel shipments fell an average of 2 percent due to
lower nickel costs and continued competitive price pressures,
particularly from imported products.

Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 73 percent
versus 76 percent a year earlier.  The improved cost ratio was
chiefly the result of the increased production level and
manufacturing efficiency gains for the Steel Division.  These
favorable effects were partially offset by the lower unit selling
prices.  Cost of sales in each of the last two fiscal years was
favorably affected by reductions in inventories valued using the
LIFO method.  The LIFO method values inventory reductions at
historical costs which were lower than current costs.  This
favorable effect on costs, before taxes and profit sharing
impacts, was $24.9 million in fiscal 1994 and $25.7 million in
fiscal 1993.

<PAGE>
Raw material costs per unit purchased decreased by 6 percent
during fiscal 1994 versus the year-earlier costs primarily
because of a 15 percent drop in the cost of nickel.  Labor costs 
for Steel Division production and maintenance employees were up 
by 4 percent as a result of base wage increases in July 1993 and 
higher profit sharing payments.  Excluding the Company's Mexican 
operations, there was a decrease of about 40 salaried employees 
during fiscal 1994, offsetting most of the increase in salaries 
due to inflation.

Natural gas costs per unit consumed increased by 27 percent over
fiscal 1993's level, but electricity costs per unit fell by 13
percent.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $10.3 million
during fiscal 1994 due chiefly to the inclusion of Aceros Fortuna
costs in fiscal 1994 and increased salaried employment costs.

Interest expense was lower by $5.1 million in fiscal 1994
principally because of the capitalization of $3.6 million of
interest related to the investment in the Walsin-CarTech
Specialty Steel Corporation in Taiwan (described in Note 3 to the
financial statements).  Also, interest rates were lower,
especially since the retirement of the 12-7/8% debentures in
March 1994.

Fiscal 1994 includes $.9 million of losses for the Company's 19
percent share of the losses of the Walsin-CarTech joint venture
(described in Note 3 to the financial statements).

Other income decreased by $4.1 million primarily because fiscal
1993 income included a $3.7 million award in a patent suit.

Income taxes as a percent of pre-tax income (effective tax rate)
increased to 39 percent in fiscal 1994 from 38 percent a year
earlier because of an increase in the federal statutory rate.  A
reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the federal statutory
rate is presented in Note 14 to the financial statements.
During fiscal 1994, the Company retired at a premium, $55.3
million of its 12-7/8% debentures, and recorded an extraordinary
charge of $2.0 million including unamortized discount and issue
costs, net of $1.2 million of income tax benefits (described in
Note 7 to the financial statements).

Results of Operations - Fiscal 1993 Versus Fiscal 1992

Sales increased by 1 percent in fiscal 1993.  Total unit volume
shipped increased by 6 percent while lower average selling prices
and product mix changes reduced average selling prices by 2
percent and 3 percent, respectively.  Fiscal 1993 sales were
enhanced by securing additional mill-direct business for high
turnover items to help fill vacancies in mill schedules. 
However, this additional business had lower than average selling
prices and profit margins.  The aerospace markets continued to
weaken throughout the year.  Selling prices were under continued
pressure due to a very competitive market, increased imports and
lower raw material costs.

<PAGE>
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased slightly in
fiscal 1993 due to a $25.7 million positive effect on earnings of
reductions in inventories valued using the LIFO method.  This
benefit was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of
operating production facilities at lower capacity rates, a less
profitable sales mix and lower unit selling prices.

Raw material costs per unit purchased decreased by 10 percent in
fiscal 1993 from year-earlier levels.  Nickel and chromium costs
decreased by 16 percent and 7 percent, respectively.

Labor costs per-hour-worked for Steel Division production and
maintenance employees increased by 14 percent in fiscal 1993.  An
average base wage increase of 4 percent on July 1, 1992, higher
profit sharing payments and increased costs for retiree medical
expenses were the chief factors.  The salaried staff level was
reduced by approximately 130 people as a result of a cost
reduction program.  

Other income increased by $5.0 million as a result of a $3.7
million award in a patent suit and an increase in interest
income.

Interest expense increased in fiscal 1993 by 5 percent to $20.6
million due to a full-year effect of the fiscal 1992 refinancing
of short-term debt to long-term debt at higher interest rates.

Income taxes as a percent of pre-tax income (effective tax rate)
increased to 38 percent in fiscal 1993 from 34.8 percent in
fiscal 1992 due to increased state income taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash Flow

Cash flow from operations remained at high levels throughout the
past three fiscal years due to strong income before extraordinary
charges and the cumulative effect of accounting changes and
because of significant inventory reductions.  A $10.0 million
lump sum royalty payment received from Walsin-CarTech also
improved cash flow during fiscal 1994 (see Note 3 to the
financial statements).

Excluding the Aceros Fortuna inventory acquired, inventories
decreased by $41.8 million in terms of current costs during
fiscal 1994 as a result of the Company's Continuous Improvement
process to reduce lead times while still maintaining a high
customer service level.  Since most of this reduction was in
inventories accounted for on the LIFO method, the reduction was
only $16.9 million in terms of historical costs for accounting
purposes.  The $24.9 million differential was reflected as a
reduction in cost of sales during fiscal 1994.  The Company's
Continuous Improvement process also helped reduce inventories
during fiscal 1993 by $88.9 million in terms of current costs.

<PAGE>
Accounts receivable increased $1.9 million in fiscal 1994,
excluding the Aceros Fortuna accounts receivable acquired, and
$12.5 million in fiscal 1993, as a result of increased fourth
quarter sales each year.  The average days sales outstanding in
1994 was comparable to 1993.

Capital expenditures of $26.6 million in fiscal 1994 were
concentrated in the Company's Reading, Pennsylvania, plant for
normal replacements, modernization and incremental capability. 
The major capital projects were for the modernization of wire
finishing operations and the purchase and installation of a
second rotary forge.

On July 28, 1993, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Aceros Fortuna and two affiliated companies for cash of
$20.4 million and paid $2.5 million for agreements not to compete
(described in Note 2 to the financial statements).  On
September 2, 1993, the Company acquired, for $45.0 million in
cash, 19 percent of the shares of the Walsin-CarTech joint
venture (described in Note 3 to the financial statements).

On March 1, 1994, the Company retired at a premium, the entire
outstanding principal amount of $55.3 million of its 12-7/8%
debentures.  The funding for this retirement came from the
Company's credit facilities, but is intended to be replaced with
long-term debt in the future (described in Note 7 to the
financial statements).  Payments made on other long-term debt
totaled $13.4 million and $6.8 million in fiscal 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

The dividend payout rates on common and preferred stock were
maintained at $2.40 and $5,362.50 per share, respectively, and
totaled about $21.0 million in each of the past three years. 
Dividends on common stock will continue to be reviewed
periodically in light of projected earnings trends and cash
requirements.

In June 1989, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
up to 1,200,000 shares of Carpenter common stock, and in
September 1991, in conjunction with the establishment of an ESOP,
the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 600,000 shares
of common stock to avoid the dilutive effect of the issuance of
convertible stock to the ESOP.  Shares purchased under these
programs totaled 346,217 in fiscal 1992 and 253,800 in fiscal
1993 for a total of $28.3 million in cash.  During fiscal 1993
and 1994, share repurchases were suspended in order to conserve 
cash for the investments discussed earlier.

Financial Condition

During fiscal 1992 through 1994, the Company maintained the
ability to provide adequate cash to meet its needs through strong
cash flow from operations, management of working capital and its
flexibility to use outside sources of financing to supplement
internally generated funds.

<PAGE>
Fiscal 1994 ended in a sound liquidity position, with current
assets exceeding current liabilities by $72.7 million (a ratio of
1.7 to 1).  This favorable ratio is conservatively stated because
inventories are valued $125.7 million less than the current cost
as a result of using the LIFO method.  Total debt at June 30,
1994 was $173.7 million or 35.7 percent of total capital,
including deferred taxes, versus 41.0 percent of total capital,
including deferred taxes, at June 30, 1993.

In January 1994, the Company entered into a $150.0 million
financing arrangement with a number of banks, providing for the
availability of $125.0 million of revolving credit to
January 1998 and lines of credit of $25.0 million.  This facility
was used to fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Certech,
Inc. (described in Note 17 to the financial statements). 
Interest is based on short-term market rates or competitive bids.

This financing arrangement replaced a previous revolving credit
and lines of credit arrangement.

In summary, we believe that our present financial resources, both
from internal and external sources, are adequate to meet our
foreseeable short-term and long-term liquidity needs.

Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental 
The Company has environmental liabilities at some of its owned
operating facilities, and has been designated as a "potentially
responsible party" with respect to certain superfund waste
disposal sites.  Additionally, the Company has been notified that
it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other
superfund sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted
against the Company.  Neither the exact amount of cleanup costs
nor the final method of their allocations among all designated
potentially responsible parties at these superfund sites has been
determined.  The estimated range of the reasonably possible costs
of remediation at the Company-owned operating facilities and the
superfund sites is between $7.0 million and $15.0 million.  The
Company has accrued for environmental remediation costs which
represent management's best estimate of the probable and
reasonably estimable remediation costs.  Additional details are
provided in Note 16 to the financial statements.  The Company
does not anticipate that its financial position will be
materially affected by additional environmental remediation
costs, although quarterly or annual operating results could be
materially affected by future developments.  

Other
The Company is also defending various claims and legal actions,
and is subject to commitments and contingencies which are common
to its operations.  The Company provides for costs relating to
these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reason-
ably estimable.  Additional details are provided in Note 16 to
the financial statements.  While it is not feasible to determine
the outcome of these matters, in the opinion of management, any
total ultimate liability will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position.

To the Shareholders of 
Carpenter Technology Corporation:  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of
Carpenter Technology Corporation and subsidiaries listed in the index
on page 19 of this Form 10-K.  These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Carpenter Technology Corporation and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its methods for accounting for income taxes
and postretirement benefits other than pensions in the year ended
June 30, 1993.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                __________


 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Basis of Consolidation

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
    of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries.  All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated.  The equity method of accounting is used when
    the Company has less than a 50% interest in other entities. 
    Under the equity method, original investments are recorded
    at cost and adjusted by the Company's share of undistributed
    earnings or losses of these entities.

    Business Segment

    The Company is engaged in one business segment, the
    manufacture, fabrication and distribution of specialty
    metals.

    Cash Equivalents

    Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with
    maturities at the time of acquisition of three months or
    less.  Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
    approximates market.

    Inventories

    Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost
    for inventories is principally determined by the Last-In,
    First-Out (LIFO) method.

    Depreciation

    Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed by
    the straight-line method.  This method allocates
    depreciation equally over the estimated lives of the assets,
    which principally are 45 years for buildings and 20 years
    for machinery and equipment.  Depreciation for income tax
    purposes is computed using accelerated methods.

    Goodwill and Covenants Not to Compete

    Other assets include goodwill and covenants not to compete
    arising from the acquisition of Aceros Fortuna.  The
    covenants are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their 4 year contractual life.  Goodwill, representing the
    excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value
    of the net assets of Aceros Fortuna, is being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over 20 years.  The Company's policy is
    to record an impairment loss against the goodwill in the
    period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the
    asset may not be recoverable.  This determination includes
    evaluation of factors such as current market value, future

<PAGE>
 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

    asset utilization, business climate and future cash flows
    expected to result from the use of the net assets.

    Environmental Expenditures

    Environmental expenditures that pertain to current
    operations or relate to future revenues are expensed or
    capitalized consistent with the Company's capitalization
    policy.  Expenditures that result from the remediation of an
    existing condition caused by past operations, that do not
    contribute to current or future revenues, are expensed. 
    Liabilities are recognized for remedial activities when the
    cleanup is probable and the cost can be reasonably
    estimated.  Recoveries of expenditures are recognized as a
    receivable only when they are estimable and probable.

    Foreign Currency Translation

    The functional currency for the majority of the Company's
    international operations is the local currency, and,
    accordingly, the respective assets and liabilities are
    translated at year-end exchange rates, while the income and
    expense components are translated at average exchange rates
    prevailing during the year.  The resulting translation
    adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of
    shareholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheet.  All
    gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
    transactions are reflected in income.

    Futures Contracts and Commodity Price Swaps

    In connection with the anticipated purchase of nickel for
    certain future sales, the Company enters into nickel futures
    contracts and commodity price swaps to reduce the risk of
    nickel cost increases.  These futures contracts and
    commodity price swaps are accounted for as hedges, and,
    accordingly, gains and losses are deferred and included in
    cost of sales as part of the nickel cost in the periods when
    the nickel purchases are made.  At June 30, 1994, the
    Company had entered into contracts hedging future commodity
    purchases of approximately $19.7 million.  The fair market
    value of these contracts was $21.3 million.

<PAGE>
 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

    Earnings per Common Share

    Primary earnings per common share are computed by dividing
    net income (less preferred dividends net of tax benefits) by
    the weighted average number of common shares and common
    share equivalents outstanding during the period.  On a
    fully-diluted basis, both net earnings and shares
    outstanding are adjusted to assume the conversion of the
    convertible preferred stock.

    Changes in Accounting Principles

    During fiscal 1993, the Company adopted two financial
    accounting standards, "Employers' Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" (SFAS 106) and
    "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).  

    SFAS 106 requires companies to accrue the cost of
    postretirement benefits over the years employees provide
    services to the date of their full eligibility for such
    benefits.  Previously, these costs were expensed as claims
    were incurred.  The Company elected to immediately recognize
    the transition obligation for benefits earned as of July 1,
    1992, resulting in a non-cash charge of $146.8 million
    pre-tax ($87.1 million after taxes or $10.87 per share),
    representing the cumulative effect of the change in
    accounting.  The expense accrued in fiscal 1993 under the
    new method exceeded the amount under the previous method by
    $7.4 million pre-tax ($4.3 million after taxes or $.54 per
    share).

    SFAS 109 changes the method of accounting for income taxes
    from the deferral method to the asset/liability method. 
    Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined
    based on enacted tax laws and rates, which are applied to
    the differences between the financial statement bases and
    tax bases of assets and liabilities.  The adoption of this
    statement resulted in a credit to income of $12.4 million
    ($1.55 per share) principally for the cumulative effect of
    restating deferred taxes as of July 1, 1992 to current tax
    rates.  This new standard also increased the deferred taxes
    provided during fiscal 1993 by $1.8 million ($.23 per
    share).

    Financial statements of years prior to fiscal 1993 were not
    restated for the adoption of these new standards.

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

    Company-Owned Life Insurance Program 
    
    During fiscal 1994, the Company established a Company-Owned
    Life Insurance program covering essentially all of the U.S.
    based employees.  At June 30, 1994, the cash surrender value
    ($27.4 million) and the insurance policy loans ($27.2
    million) were netted and included in other assets on the
    consolidated balance sheet.  The purpose of the program is to
    provide cash to fund employee benefit obligations and for
    other corporate purposes.

  2. ACQUISITION OF WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

    On July 28, 1993, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Aceros Fortuna, S.A. de C.V., a
    Mexican steel distribution company, and two affiliated
    companies for cash of $20.4 million, paid $2.5 million for
    agreements not to compete, and paid acquisition costs.  In
    addition, the Company acquired equipment from an affiliated
    company in Mexico for $5.1 million.

    The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting, and, accordingly, the purchase price
    has been allocated to the assets purchased and the
    liabilities assumed based upon the fair values at the date
    of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the
    fair values of the net assets acquired was $8.2 million and
    has been recorded as goodwill, which is being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over 20 years.  The amount of goodwill
    amortization for fiscal 1994 was $.4 million.

    The net purchase price was allocated as follows:

    (in thousands)

    Working capital, other than cash             $  6,552
    Property, plant and equipment                   6,634
    Other assets                                    2,661
    Goodwill                                        8,213
    Other liabilities                              (1,737)
                                                 --------
         Purchase price, net of cash received    $ 22,323
                                                 ========
    
    The operating results of these acquired businesses have been
    included in the consolidated statement of income from the
    date of acquisition.  On the basis of a pro forma
    consolidation of the results of operations as if the
    acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 1993
    rather than at July 28, 1993, consolidated net sales would
    have been $631.5 million for fiscal 1994, and $609.8 million 
    for fiscal 1993.  Consolidated pro forma income and earnings

    per share, before the cumulative effect of accounting
    changes and extraordinary charge, would not have been
    materially different from the reported amounts for fiscal
    1994 and 1993.  Such pro forma amounts are not necessarily
    indicative of what the actual consolidated results of
    operations might have been if the acquisition had been
    effective at the beginning of fiscal 1993.

 3. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE 

    On September 2, 1993, the Company acquired for $45.0 million
    in cash, 19 percent of the shares of Walsin-CarTech
    Specialty Steel Corporation, a joint venture with Walsin
    Lihwa Corporation in Taiwan.  The joint venture has
    constructed a facility and installed equipment in this
    facility in Taiwan to manufacture and distribute specialty
    steel.  The Company has an option to acquire up to an
    additional 16 percent of the outstanding shares of the joint
    venture from Walsin Lihwa at any time until July 1, 1996. 
    Alternatively, the Company may require Walsin Lihwa to
    purchase its 19 percent ownership for the original purchase
    cost at any time up to July 1, 1997.  

    This investment is being accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting.  The investment account has been
    increased for interest costs capitalized during the
    preoperating period, totaling $3.6 million, and for
    acquisition costs.  The Company's share of the joint
    venture's foreign currency translation adjustments is
    reflected in both the investment account and shareholders'
    equity on the consolidated balance sheet.

 7. DEBT ARRANGEMENTS

    In January 1994, the Company entered into a $150.0 million
    financing arrangement with a number of banks, providing for
    the availability of $125.0 million of revolving credit to
    January 1998 and lines of credit of $25.0 million.  Interest
    is based on short-term market rates or competitive bids. 
    This financing arrangement replaced a previous revolving
    credit and lines of credit arrangement.

    At June 30, 1994, the Company had on file a Form S-3
    registration statement ("Shelf Registration") with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the
    issuance of up to $100.0 million of medium-term debt
    securities.  The net proceeds from any offering under this
    Shelf Registration will be added to the Company's working
    capital and be available for general corporate purposes.  

    For the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, interest
    cost totaled $19.6 million, $21.8 million and $20.6 million,
    of which $4.1 million, $1.2 million, and $1.0 million,
    respectively, was capitalized.

   =======================================================================

    Aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the four years
    subsequent to June 30, 1995 are $6.6 million in fiscal 1996
    and $3.0 million in fiscal 1997 through 1999.  The fair
    value of long-term debt as of June 30, 1994, determined by
    using current interest rates and market values of similar
    issues, was approximately $179.0 million.

    During fiscal 1994, the Company used proceeds from the
    revolving credit facilities to retire at a premium $55.3
    million of its 12-7/8% debentures originally due in 
    2014.  This retirement resulted in an extraordinary charge
    of $2.0 million including unamortized discount and issue
    costs, net of $1.2 million of income tax benefits, or $.25
    per share.  Although the funding for the retirement
    principally came from the Company's credit facilities, it is
    intended to be replaced with long-term debt in the future. 
    Consequently, such debt of $39.3 million at June 30, 1994
    was classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance
    sheet.

    During fiscal 1992, the Company used proceeds from short-
    term borrowings to retire at a premium $18.4 million of its
    12-7/8% debentures originally due in 2014.  This retirement
    resulted in an extraordinary charge of $1.2 million
    including unamortized discount and issue costs, net of $.7
    million of income tax benefits, or $.15 per share.

    The Company's financing arrangements contain restrictions
    which, among other things, limit the aggregate amount of the
    Company's dividends.  Reinvested earnings available for
    dividends at June 30, 1994 were approximately $62.5 million.

<PAGE>
8. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

    The Company has issued one common stock purchase right
    ("Right") for every outstanding share of common stock.  The
    Rights will become exercisable and separate Rights
    certificates will be distributed to the shareholders: (1) 10
    days following the acquisition of 20 percent or more of the
    Company's common stock, (2) 10 business days (or such later
    date as the Board may determine) following the commencement
    of a tender or exchange offer for 20 percent or more of the
    Company's common stock, or (3) 10 days after the Company's
    Board of Directors determines that a holder of 15 percent or
    more of the Company's shares has an interest adverse to
    those of the Company or its shareholders (an "adverse
    person").  Upon distribution, each Right would then entitle
    a holder to buy from the Company one newly issued share of
    its common stock for an exercise price of $90.  After
    distribution, upon: (1) any person acquiring 20 percent of
    the outstanding stock (other than pursuant to a fair offer
    as determined by the Board), (2) a 20 percent holder
    engaging in certain self-dealing transactions, (3) the
    determination of an adverse person, or (4) certain mergers
    or similar transactions between the Company and holder of 20
    percent or more of the Company's common stock, each Right
    (other than those held by the acquiring party) entitles the
    holder to purchase shares of common stock of either the
    acquiring company or the Company (depending on the
    circumstances) having a market value equal to twice the
    exercise price of the Right.  The Rights may be redeemed by
    the Company for $.05 per Right at any time before they
    become exercisable and expire June 26, 1996.  

 9. COMMON STOCK OPTIONS

    The Company has three incentive stock option plans for
    officers and key employees: a 1993 plan, a 1982 plan and a
    1977 plan.  

    The 1993 plan provides that the Board of Directors may grant
    incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights and restricted stock, and will determine
    the terms and conditions of each grant.  Option grants under
    this plan must be at no less than market value on the date
    of grant, are exercisable after one year of employment
    following the date of grant, and will expire no more than
    ten years after the date of grant.  Incentive stock options
    granted during the ten-year term of the plan may not exceed
    500,000 shares plus any shares canceled or expired.  The
    number of shares available annually for awards under this
    plan is limited to one percent of the common shares
    outstanding at the end of the preceding fiscal year plus
    shares available, but not awarded, during the preceding two
<PAGE>
   years and any shares or options forfeited, expired or
    terminated.  Restricted stock awards vest equally at the end
    of each year of employment for the five-year period from the
    date of grant.  When the restricted shares are issued,
    deferred compensation is recorded in the shareholders'
    equity section of the consolidated balance sheet.  The
    deferred compensation is charged to expense over the vesting
    period.  During fiscal 1994, $.2 million was charged to
    expense.  As of June 30, 1994 and 1993, 10,582 and 7,864
    shares, respectively, were reserved for options and
    restricted stock which may be granted under this plan. 

    The 1982 plan expired in June 1992; however, all outstanding
    unexpired options granted prior to that date remain in
    effect.  Under the 1982 and 1977 plans, options are granted
    at the market value on the date of grant, and are
    exercisable after one year of employment following the date
    of grant.  Options granted under the 1982 plan expire five
    years after grant if granted prior to August 9, 1990, and
    all the options granted since that date expire ten years
    after grant.  Options granted under the 1977 plan expire ten
    years after grant.  At June 30, 1994 and 1993, 142,360
    shares were reserved for options which may be granted under
    the 1977 plan.

    The Company also has a stock option plan which provides for
    the granting of stock options to non-employee Directors. 
    Options are granted at the market value on the date of the
    grant and are exercisable after one year of Board service
    following the date of grant.  Options expire ten years after
    the date of grant.  At June 30, 1994 and 1993, 51,000 and
    58,500 shares, respectively, were reserved for options which
    may be granted under this plan.

    Of the 362,176 options outstanding at June 30, 1994, 120,470
    relate to the 1993 plan, 147,876 relate to the 1982 plan,
    61,830 relate to the 1977 plan and 32,000 relate to the plan
    for non-employee Directors.  No adjustments to income are
    made with respect to options granted or exercised under the
    plans.  

10. PENSION PLANS

    The Company has several noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plans, which cover substantially all employees.  The
    benefits are based primarily upon employees' years of
    service and average earnings prior to retirement.  The
    Company's funding policy for the domestic plans is to
    contribute, at a minimum, amounts sufficient to meet ERISA
    requirements.  Plan assets are held in trust, and consist
    primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income
    instruments.  The underfunded plans include the pension plan
    of the Company's Mexican operations and several supplemental
    retirement plans for certain key employees and outside
    Directors.

    The actuarial present value of the projected benefit
    obligation is computed assuming the continuing existence of
    the plans.  The obligation to fund these plans would be
    substantially higher than the accumulated benefit obligation
    if the plans were terminated.  

    The Company also maintains a defined contribution pension
    and savings plan for substantially all domestic employees. 
    The Company contributions, equal to 3% of each participant's
    base pay, were $3.7 million in fiscal 1994, $3.6 million in
    fiscal 1993 and $3.7 million in fiscal 1992.  

11. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

    In addition to pension plan benefits, the Company provides
    certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
    employees and covered dependents.  Substantially all
    domestic employees become eligible for these benefits upon
    normal retirement.  

<PAGE>
   In fiscal 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS 106) "Employers'
    Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
    (see Note 1).

    Expense of postretirement medical and life insurance
    benefits in fiscal years 1994 and 1993 included the
    following components:

                *Declines 1% per year to the ultimate rate.      
    ===========================================================

    The .5% reduction of the discount rate increased expense $.6
    million in fiscal 1994.

    Financial statements of years prior to fiscal 1993 were not
    restated for the adoption of SFAS 106.  Postretirement
    medical and life insurance claims incurred for fiscal 1992
    totaled $7.1 million.

<PAGE>
   The funded status of the postretirement medical and life
    insurance benefit plans at June 30, 1994 and 1993, is
    summarized as follows:

          *Declines 1% per year to the ultimate rate.          
    ===========================================================

    The health-care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
    effect on the amounts reported.  If the assumed health-care
    cost trend rate was increased by 1 percent, the APBO at
    June 30, 1994 would increase by $18.0 million and the net
    periodic postretirement benefit expense for fiscal 1994
    would have increased by $2.0 million.

    The Company established a Voluntary Employee Benefit Trust
    (VEBA) in fiscal 1992 to begin funding its obligation under
    the postretirement health-care plan.  Contributions of $5.0
    million per year beginning in fiscal 1992 were made to the
    VEBA Trust.  The VEBA Trust assets have been invested in
    trust-owned life insurance.

<PAGE>
12. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

    In fiscal 1992, the Board of Directors established a
    leveraged employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") to assist
    current employees with their future retiree medical
    obligations.  The Company issued 461.5 shares of a new class
    of convertible preferred stock at $65,000.00 per share to
    the ESOP in exchange for a $30.0 million 15-year, 9.345%
    note which is included in the shareholders' equity section
    of the consolidated balance sheet as deferred compensation. 
    The preferred stock is recorded net of related issuance
    costs.

    Principal and interest obligations on the note will be
    satisfied by the ESOP as the Company makes contributions to
    the ESOP and dividends are paid on the preferred stock.  As
    payments are made on the note, shares of preferred stock
    will be allocated to participating employees' accounts
    within the ESOP.  The Company contributed $.9 million in
    fiscal 1994, $.6 million in fiscal 1993 and $.4 million in
    fiscal 1992 to the ESOP.  Compensation expense related to
    the plan was $2.1 million in fiscal 1994, $2.0 million in
    fiscal 1993 and $1.3 million in fiscal 1992.

    The preferred stock is initially convertible into
    approximately 461,500 shares of common stock, at a
    conversion price of $65.00 per share of common stock.  The
    shares of preferred stock pay a cumulative annual dividend
    of $5,362.50 per share, are entitled to vote together with
    the common stock as a single class and have 1,300 votes per
    share.  The stock is redeemable by the Company at any time
    after September 5, 1996 at an initial price of $67,600.00
    per share.

13. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Research and development expenses aggregated $13.6 million
    in fiscal 1994, $12.9 million in fiscal 1993 and $14.0
    million in fiscal 1992.

14. INCOME TAXES

    In fiscal 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109) "Accounting for
    Income Taxes" (see Note 1).

<PAGE>
14. INCOME TAXES (continued)

    Provisions for income taxes consisted of the following:

15. SPECIAL CHARGE

    In June 1992, a provision of $7.5 million ($4.9 million
    after taxes or $.59 per share) was established for the
    anticipated costs of a planned program to reduce salaried
    personnel.  Affected employees were provided severance pay,
    temporary health care, and life insurance coverage.

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    Environmental

    The Company, as well as other steel companies, is subject to
    various stringent federal, state, and local environmental
    laws and regulations.  The liability for future
    environmental remediation costs is evaluated on a quarterly
    basis by management.  The Company accrues amounts for
    environmental remediation costs which represent management's
    best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs
    relating to environmental remediation.  For the years ended
    June 30, 1994 and 1992, $1.2 million and $2.2 million,
    respectively, were charged to operations for environmental
    cleanup costs (no expense was recognized in fiscal 1993). 
    The liability for environmental cleanup costs remaining at
    June 30, 1994 and 1993, was $4.7 million, while the amount of
   <PAGE>
recoveries recorded as a receivable was $.8 million at
    June 30, 1994.  As a result of factors such as the
    continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory
    requirements, the availability and application of
    technology, the identification of presently unknown
    remediation sites and the allocation of costs among
    potentially responsible parties, estimated costs for future
    environmental compliance and remediation are necessarily
    imprecise and it is not possible to predict the amount or
    timing of future costs of environmental remediation
    requirements which may subsequently be determined.  Based
    upon information presently available, such future costs are
    not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
    Company's competitive or financial position.  However, such
    costs could be material to results of operations in a
    particular future quarter or year.  

    Other

    The Company is also defending various claims and legal
    actions, and is subject to commitments and contingencies
    which are common to its operations.  The Company provides
    for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable
    and the amount is reasonably estimable.  The effect of the
    outcome of these matters on the Company's future results of
    operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any
    such effect depends on future results of operations and the
    amount of timing (both as to recording future charges to
    operations and cash expenditures) of the resolution of such
    matters.  While it is not feasible to determine the outcome
    of these matters, in the opinion of management, any total
    ultimate liability will not have a material effect on the
    Company's financial position.  

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

    On July 22, 1994, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Certech, Inc. and an affiliated
    company, for $16.0 million comprised of $12.8 million in
    cash and the balance in shares of Carpenter common stock. 
    Certech manufactures a broad line of complex injection
    molded ceramics parts.

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) 

Our quarterly sales and earnings results are usually influenced
by seasonal factors.  The first fiscal quarter (three months
ending September 30) is typically the lowest because of annual
plant vacation shutdowns in this period by Carpenter and by many
of our customers.  This seasonal pattern can be disrupted by
major economic cycles or special accounting adjustments.

         dated May 18, 1994, with respect to the execution of
         two Agreements and Plans of Merger to acquire all of

         affiliated companies, Certech, Incorporated, a
         Pennsylvania corporation, and Certech, Inc., a
         New Jersey corporation (jointly, "Certech").  The
         purchase price was not disclosed.  Certech manufactures

         closing of the transaction occurred on July 22, 1994,
         at which time the Company paid approximately 80 percent
         of the purchase price in cash and 20 percent in common
         stock.

Notes: (1)    For details of debt arrangements, see Note 7 to
              the financial statements included in Item 8
              "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
       (2)    The average amount outstanding during the period
              was computed by multiplying the principal amount
              outstanding by the number of days outstanding and
              dividing the total by the number of days in the
              year.
       (3)    The weighted average interest rate during the

      l.l  Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of stockholders
           --------------
  shall be held during the last two weeks of October in each
  
  year, and shall be held at a place and time determined by the
  
  Board of Directors (the "Board"). 
       
       At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such
  
  business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought
  
  before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual
  
  meeting, business must be specified in the notice of meeting
  
  (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the
  
  Board, otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at

  applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought
  
  before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must
  
  have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of
  
  the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be
  
  delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive
  
  offices of the Corporation, not less than 50 days prior to the
  
  meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 65
  
  days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the
  
  meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the
  
  stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the

  no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in
  
  accordance with the procedures set forth in the section 1.1,
  
  provided, however, that nothing in this section 1.1 shall be
  
  deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any
  
  business properly brought before the annual meeting in
  
  accordance with said procedure.
      
     The chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts
  
  warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was
  
  not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the
  
  provisions of this section 1.1 and, if he should so determine,
  
  he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not

           ------
  holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote shall con-
  
  stitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, except as
  
  otherwise provided by law.  In the absence of a quorum any
  
  officer entitled to preside at or act as secretary of such
  
  meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time
  
  to time until a quorum is present, without further notice other
  
  than announcement at the meeting of the adjourned time and

  2.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  
      ------------------
      
      2.l  Number, Election and Term of Directors.  The business
           --------------------------------------
  of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board, which shall
  
  consist of up to 15 Directors.  A person to be qualified for
  
  election as director shall be a bona fide holder of at least
  
  one share of the capital stock of the Corporation having voting
  
  rights, or a shareholder in a corporation owning twenty-five
  
  percentum or more of the Corporation's capital stock.  The
  
  Board of Directors shall be divided into three equal classes as
  
  possible. The term of office of the first class will expire at
  
  the first annual meeting of the stockholders, that of the
  
  second class will expire at the second annual meeting, and that
  
  of the third class will expire at the third annual meeting.  At
  
  each annual meeting of the stockholders after such classifica-
  
  tion, directors shall be chosen for a term of three years to
  
  succeed those whose terms expire, and shall hold office until
  
  the third following annual meeting of stockholders and until
  
  the election of their respective successors, subject to the
  
  provisions of section 2.6 hereof.  The number of directors may
  
  be changed by resolution of two-thirds of the entire Board or
  
  by a vote of the holders of two-thirds of the issued and
  
  outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, but any
 <PAGE>
 
  such change shall be made as nearly pro rata as possible among
  
  the three classes, and no decrease may shorten the term of any
  
  incumbent director; in no event shall the Board of Directors
  
  consist of less than three directors.  Directors shall be
  
  elected at each annual meeting of stockholders by a plurality
  
  of the votes cast by written ballot.  As used in these by-laws,
  
  "entire Board" means the total number of directors which the
  
  Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. 
      
      2.2  Quorum and Manner of Acting.  A majority of the
           ---------------------------
  directors in office (but not less than one-third of the entire
  
  Board) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
  
  business at any meeting, except as provided in section 2.7 of
  
  these by-laws.  Action of the Board shall be authorized by the
  
  vote of a majority of the directors present at the time of the
  
  vote, if a quorum is present, unless otherwise provided by law
  
  or these by-laws.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of
  
  the directors present may adjourn any meeting from time to time
  
  until a quorum is present, on notice given as provided in
  
  Section 2.5 hereof. 
      
      2.3  Annual and Regular Meetings.  Annual meetings of the
           ---------------------------

  after the annual meeting of stockholders and at the same place,
  
  or (b) as soon as practicable after the annual meeting of
  
  stockholders on notice as provided in Section 2.5 of these by-
  
  laws.  Regular meetings of the Board may be held at such times
  
  and places as the Board determines.

     2.4  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board may
           ----------------

  Officer or by three directors, one from each class of directors
  
  then in office. 
  
       2.5  Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice.  Notice of the
            ------------------------------------

  be given to each director by mailing it to him at his residence
  
  or usual place of business at least five days before the
  
  meeting, or by delivering or telephoning or telegraphing it to
  
  him at least one day before the meeting.  Notice of a special
  
  meeting shall also state the general purpose or purposes for
  
  which the meeting is called.  Notice need not be given to any
  
  director who submits a signed waiver of notice before or after
  
  the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting the
  
  lack of notice to him, either before the meeting or when it
  
  begins.  Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given,
  
  other than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjourn-
  
  ment is taken. 
       
       2.6  Resignation and Retirement of Directors.  Any
            ---------------------------------------
  director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
  
  Chief Executive Officer or Secretary of the Corporation, to
  
  take effect at the time specified therein.  The acceptance of
  
  such resignation, unless required by the terms thereof, shall
  
  not be necessary to make it effective.  Unless otherwise
  
  provided by resolution of the Board, any director who is also
  
  an officer of the Corporation shall retire from the Board upon
  
  his attaining age 65 or upon his earlier retirement as an

  the members of the Board or committee. 
      
      2.9  Compensation.  Directors shall receive such compen-
           ------------

  provided, however, that in the event that less than 65 days'
  
  notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is
  
  given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be
  
  timely must be so received not later than the close of business

  date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was
  
  made.  Such stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set

              indirectly, of securities of the Company
              representing 20% or more of the total voting power
              represented by the Company's then outstanding
              Voting Securities, or (ii) during any period of two
              consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning
              of such period constitute the Board of Directors of
              the Company and any new director whose election by
              the Board of Directors or nomination for election
              by the Company's stockholders was approved by a
              vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors
              then still in office who either were directors at
              the beginning of the period or whose election or
              nomination for election was previously so approved,
              cease for any reason to constitute a majority
              thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of the Company
              approve a merger or consolidation of the Company
              with any other corporation, other than a merger or
              consolidation which would result in the Voting
              Securities of the Company outstanding immediately
              prior thereto continuing to represent (either by
              remaining outstanding or by being converted into
              Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least
              80% of the total voting power represented by the
              Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving
              entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
              consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company
              approve a plan of complete liquidation of the
              Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition
              by the Company of (in one transaction or a series
              of transactions) all or substantially all the
              Company's assets.

              investigation, whether instituted by the Company or
              any other party, that Indemnitee in good faith
              believes might lead to the institution of any such
              action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
              criminal, administrative, investigative or other.

         (c)  Expenses:  include attorneys' fees and all other

              related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a
              director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of
              the Company, or is or was serving at the request of
              the Company as a director, officer, employee,

              attorneys, selected in accordance with the

              Indemnitee within the last five years (other than
              with respect to matters concerning the rights of
              Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other
              indemnitees under similar indemnity agreements).
<PAGE>
         (f)  Potential Change in Control:  shall be deemed to
               ---------------------------
              have occurred if (i) the Company enters into an
              agreement, the consummation of which would result
              in the occurrence of a Change in Control; (ii) any
              person (including the Company) publicly announces
              an intention to take or to consider taking actions
              which if consummated would constitute a Change in
              Control; (iii) any person, other than a trustee or
              other fiduciary holding securities under an
              employee benefit plan of the Company or a
              corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the
              stockholders of the Company in substantially the
              same proportions as their ownership of stock of the
              Company, who is or becomes the beneficial owner,
              directly or indirectly, of securities of the
              Company representing 9.5% or more of the combined
              voting power of the Company's then outstanding
              Voting Securities, increases his beneficial
              ownership of such securities by five percentage
              points (5%) or more over the percentage so owned by
              such person; or (iv) the Board adopts a resolution
              to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement,
              a Potential Change in Control has occurred.

         (g)  Reviewing Party: any appropriate person or body
              ---------------
              consisting of a member or members of the Company's
              Board of Directors or any other person or body
              appointed by the Board who is not a party to the
              particular Claim for which Indemnitee is seeking
              indemnification, or Independent Legal Counsel.

         (h)  Voting Securities: any securities of the Company
              -----------------
              which vote generally in the election of directors.

         2.   Basic Indemnification Arrangement:  
              ---------------------------------

         (a)  In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party
              to or witness or other participant in, or is
              threatened to be made a party to or witness or
              other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or
              arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the
              Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest
              extent permitted by law as soon as practicable, but
              in any event no later than thirty days after
              written demand is presented to the Company, against
              any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties
              and amounts paid in settlement (including all
<PAGE>
              interest, assessments and other charges paid or
              payable in connection with or in respect of such
              Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts
              paid in settlement) of such Claim.  If so requested
              by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within
              two business days of such request) any and all
              Expenses to Indemnitee (an "Expense Advance").
              Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
              contrary, except as provided in Section 5 hereof,
              prior to a Change in Control, Indemnitee shall not
              be entitled to indemnification or Expense Advances
              pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any
              Claim initiated by Indemnitee unless the Board of
              Directors has authorized or consented to the
              initiation of such Claim.

         (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the obligations
              of the Company under Section 2(a) shall be subject
              to the condition that the Reviewing Party shall not
              have determined (in a written opinion, in any case
              in which the Independent Legal Counsel referred to
              in Section 3 hereof is involved) that Indemnitee
              would not be permitted to be indemnified under
              applicable law, and (ii) the obligation of the
              Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to
              Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition
              that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing
              Party determines that Indemnitee would not be
              permitted to be so indemnified under applicable
              law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed
              by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the
              Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid;
              provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced
              or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a
              court of competent jurisdiction to secure a
              determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified
              under applicable law, any determination made by the
              Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be
              permitted to be indemnified under applicable law
              shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be
              required to reimburse the Company for any Expense
              Advance until a final judicial determination is
              made with respect thereto (as to which all rights
              of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed).
              If there has not been a Change in Control, the
              Reviewing Party shall be selected by the Board of
              Directors and, if there has been such a Change in
              Control (other than a Change in Control which has
              been approved by a majority of the Company's Board
              of Directors who were directors immediately prior
<PAGE>
              to such Change in Control), the Reviewing Party
              shall be the Independent Legal Counsel referred to
              in Section 3 hereof.  If there has been no
              determination by the Reviewing Party or if the
              Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee
              substantively would not be permitted to be
              indemnified in whole or in part under applicable
              law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence
              litigation in any court in the States of
              Pennsylvania or Delaware having subject matter
              jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper
              seeking an initial determination by the court or
              challenging any such determination by the Reviewing
              Party or any aspect thereof, including the legal or
              factual bases therefor, and the Company hereby
              consents to service of process and to appear in any
              such proceeding.  Any determination by the
              Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and
              binding on the Company and Indemnitee.

         3.   Change in Control.  The Company agrees that, if
there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in
Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's
Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such
Change in Control), then with respect to all matters thereafter
arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments
and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or
Charter or By-law provision now or hereafter in effect relating to
Claims for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal
advice only from Independent Legal Counsel selected by Indemnitee
and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld).  Such counsel, among other things, shall
render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to
whether and to what extent the Indemnitee would be permitted to be
indemnified under applicable law.  The Company agrees to pay the
reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above
and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all expenses
(including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement
pursuant hereto.

<PAGE>
         4.   Establishment of Trust.  In the event of a Potential
               ----------------------
Change in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by
Indemnitee, create a trust for the benefit of Indemnitee and from
time to time upon written request of Indemnitee shall fund such
trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses
reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for, and
defending any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and
all judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts of any and
all Claims relating to an Indemnifiable Event from time to time
actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be
paid, provided that in no event shall more than $150,000 be
required to be deposited in any trust created hereunder in excess
of amounts deposited in respect of reasonably anticipated Expenses.
The amount or amounts to be deposited in the trust pursuant to the
foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the Reviewing
Party, in any case in which the Independent Legal Counsel referred
to above is involved.  The terms of the trust shall provide that
upon a Change in Control (i) the trust shall not be revoked or the
principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of the
Indemnitee, (ii) the trustee shall advance, within two business
days of a request by the Indemnitee, any and all Expenses to the
Indemnitee (and the Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the trust
under the circumstances under which the Indemnitee would be
required to reimburse the Company under Section 2(b) of this
Agreement), (iii) the trust shall continue to be funded by the
Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above,
(iv) the trustee shall promptly pay to Indemnitee all amounts for
which Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise, and (v) all unexpended funds in such
trust shall revert to the Company upon a final determination by the
Reviewing Party or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case
may be, that Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms
of this Agreement.  The trustee shall be a national banking
association or trust company chosen by Indemnitee.  Nothing in this
Section 4 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under
this Agreement.

<PAGE>
         5.   Indemnification for Additional Expenses.  The
               ---------------------------------------
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses
(including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall
(within two business days of such request) advance such expenses to
Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any
action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance
payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any
other agreement or Charter or By-law provision now or hereafter in
effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii)
recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether
Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such
indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as
the case may be.

         6.   Partial Indemnity, Etc.  If Indemnitee is entitled
              -----------------------
under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the
Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but not,
however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall
nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which
Indemnitee is entitled.  Moreover, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all
Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in
defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without
prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses
incurred in connection therewith.

<PAGE>
         7.   Burden of Proof.  In connection with any
               ---------------
determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether
Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of
proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not
so entitled.

         8.   No Presumptions.  For purposes of this Agreement,
              ---------------
the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by
judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court
approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its
equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not
meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular
belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not
permitted by applicable law.  In addition, neither the failure of
the Reviewing Party to have made a determination as to whether
Indemnitee has met any particular standard of conduct or had any
particular belief, nor an actual determination by the Reviewing
Party that Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct or did
not have such belief, prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by Indemnitee to secure a judicial determination that
Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law shall be a
defense to Indemnitee's claim or create a presumption that
Indemnitee has not met any particular standard of conduct or did
not have any particular belief.

         9.   Nonexclusivity, Etc.  The rights of the Indemnitee
              --------------------
hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may
have under the Company's Charter or By-laws or the Delaware General
Corporation Law or otherwise.  To the extent that a change in the
Delaware General Corporation Law (whether by statute or judicial
decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would
be afforded currently under the Company's Charter or By-laws and
this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so
afforded by such change.

         10.  Liability Insurance.  To the extent the Company
              -------------------
maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and
officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such
policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the
maximum extent of the coverage available for any Company director
or officer.


<PAGE>
         11.  Period of Limitations.  No legal action shall be
               ---------------------
brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right
of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs,
executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration
of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and
any claim or cause of action of the Company shall be extinguished
and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal
action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any
shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such
cause of action such shorter period shall govern.

         12.  Amendments, Etc.  No supplement, modification or
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in
writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

         13.  Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this
              -----------
Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall
execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be
necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such
documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit
to enforce such rights.

         14.  No Duplication of Payments.  The Company shall not
              --------------------------
be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection
with any Claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has
otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy,
Charter or By-law provision or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise
indemnifiable hereunder.
<PAGE>
         
          15.  Binding Effect, Etc.  This Agreement shall be
               --------------------
binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including
any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, executors and personal and
legal representatives.  This Agreement shall continue in effect
regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as an officer
or director of the Company or of any other enterprise at the
Company's request.

         16.  Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement
              ------------
shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof
(including any provision within a single section, paragraph or
sentence) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable in any respect, and the
validity and enforceability of any such provision in every other
respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any
way impaired and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

         17.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by 
              -------------
and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in
such state without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
laws.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this
Agreement this _____ day of __________, 1993.
