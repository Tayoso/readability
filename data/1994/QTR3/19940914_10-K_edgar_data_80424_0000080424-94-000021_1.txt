                                  PART I
                                ----------
Item 1.  Business.
         ---------
                      General Development of Business
                    -----------------------------------
     The Procter & Gamble Company is primarily a manufacturer and
distributor of household products.  Its products are sold throughout the
United States and abroad.  The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905 and
was the outgrowth of a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and
James Gamble.

     Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the "Company" as used
herein refers to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated by
reference to the letter to shareholders which appears on pages 1-5 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

               Financial Information About Industry Segments
             -------------------------------------------------
     The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Note 10. Segment Information which appears on pages 30 and 31 of the Annual
Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

                     Narrative Description of Business
                   -------------------------------------
     The products of Laundry and Cleaning, Personal Care and Food and
Beverage segments are distributed primarily through grocery stores and
other retail outlets.  The products of the Pulp and Chemicals segment are
sold direct and through jobbers.  In March 1992 the Company established a
plan to divest its commercial pulp business.  The sale of the timberlands
in July 1994 completed this plan.  The class of products information
required by this item is incorporated by reference to Note 10. Segment
Information which appears on pages 30 and 31 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

     Among the well-known names under which the Company's products are sold
are:  Ace, Always, Ariel, Attends, Bold, Bounce, Bounty, Camay, Cascade,
Charmin, Cheer, Cover Girl, Crest, Crisco, Dash, Dawn, Downy, Duncan Hines,
Era, Fairy, Flash, Folgers, Gain, Hawaiian Punch, Head and Shoulders,
Ivory, Jif, Lenor, Luvs, Max Factor, Mr. Proper, Olay, Old Spice, Pampers,
Pantene, Pert, Pringles, Punica, Rejoice, Safeguard, Scope, Secret, Sunny
Delight, Tide, Vicks, Vidal Sassoon, Whisper, and Zest.

     The Company's business, represented by the aggregate of the four
segments, is essentially homogeneous.  For the most part, the factors
necessary for an understanding of these four segments are essentially
identical.  The markets in which the Company's products are sold are highly
competitive.  The products of the Company's business segments compete with
many large and small companies and there is no dominant competitor or
competitors.  Advertising is used in conjunction with an extensive sales
force because the Company believes this combination provides the most
efficient method of marketing these types of products.  Product quality,
performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.

                                    -2-

<PAGE>

     The creation of new products and the development of new performance
benefits for consumers on the Company's existing products are vital
ingredients in its continuing progress in the highly competitive markets in
which it does business.  Basic research and product development activities
continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.  The
Company spent $1,059 million in fiscal year 1994, $956 million in 1993 and
$861 million in 1992 on such activities.  While many of the benefits from
these efforts will not be realized until future years, the Company believes
these activities demonstrate its commitment to future growth.

     The Company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments. 
Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processing of the Company's products.  The trade names of all major
products in each segment are registered trademarks.  In part, the Company's
success can be attributed to the existence of these trademarks, patents and
licenses.

     Most of the raw materials used by the Company are purchased from
others.  The Company purchases a substantial variety of raw materials, no
one of which is material to the Company's business taken as a whole.  The
price volatility of agricultural commodities is, at particular periods, of
importance to the products manufactured and sold in the Food and Beverage
products segment.

     Expenditures in fiscal year 1994 for compliance with Federal, State
and local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different
from such expenditures in the prior year, and no material increase is
expected in fiscal year 1995.

     International operations are generally characterized by the same
conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional elements including changing currency values and
different rates of inflation and rates of economic growth.  The effect of
these additional elements is more significant in the Laundry and Cleaning
and Personal Care products segments which comprise most of the Company's
international business.

     The Company has approximately 96,500 employees.

     The Company provides an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") which
is part of The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan.  Convertible preferred stock of the Company and other
assets owned by the ESOP are held through a trust (the "ESOP Trust").  The
ESOP Trust has issued certain debt securities to the public.  The Company
has fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed payment of principal
and interest on these debt securities.  Holders of these debt securities
have no recourse against the assets of the ESOP Trust except with respect
to cash contributions made by the Company to the ESOP Trust, and earnings
attributable to such contributions.  Such cash contributions are made by
the Company only to the extent that dividends on the convertible preferred
stock are inadequate to fund repayment of the debt securities.  Any such
contributions and subsequent payments to holders are made on a same-day
basis and such contributions would therefore not be held by the ESOP Trust
unless there was a default in payment on the debt securities by the ESOP
Trust after having received such contributions 


                                    -3-

<PAGE>

from the Company.  Such a default is not likely to occur and there is
therefore little likelihood that there would be assets available to satisfy
the claims of any holders of the debt securities.  A summary description of
the liabilities of the ESOP Trust and of the dividends paid by the Company
on the convertible preferred stock and cash payments from the Company to
the ESOP Trust for the three years ended June 30, 1994 are incorporated by
reference to Note 8 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on
pages 26-28 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated by
reference to the letter to shareholders which appears on pages 1-5 and
Financial Condition which appears on page 35 and 36 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

        Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations
       ------------------------------------------------------------
     The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Note 10. Segment Information which appears on pages 30 and 31 of the Annual
Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

Item 2.  Properties.
         -----------
     In the United States, the Company owns and operates manufacturing
facilities at 45 locations in 22 states.  In addition, it owns and operates
89 manufacturing facilities in 39 other countries.  Laundry and Cleaning
products are produced at 39 of these locations; Personal Care products at
90; and Food and Beverage products at 20.  Pulp and Chemicals are produced
at 18 locations.  The management considers that the Company's production
facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently, and that the
properties and equipment have been well maintained.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
         ------------------
     The Company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund
locations, many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation. 
The amount accrued at June 30, 1994 representing the Company's probable
future costs that can be reasonably estimated was $8 million.

     The Company is also involved in certain other environmental
proceedings.  No such proceeding is expected to result in material monetary
or other sanctions being imposed by any governmental entity, or in other
material liabilities.  However, the Company has agreed to participate in
the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") Section 8(e) Compliance Audit
Program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA").  As a
participant, the Company has agreed to audit its files for materials which
under current EPA guidelines would be subject to notification under Section
8(e) of TSCA and to pay stipulated penalties for each report submitted
under this program.  It is anticipated that the Company's liability under
the Program will be $1,000,000.  No administrative proceeding is pending;
however the Company anticipates being required to enter an Administrative
Order on Consent pursuant to this Program in late 1995.  In addition, the
EPA issued to a subsidiary of the Company a Finding and Notice of Violation
(NOV") dated June 16, 1994, based on Section 113(a) of the Clean Air Act
(as amended), for alleged violations of the California State Implementation
Plan by the subsidiary's manufacturing plant in Sacramento, California. 
The violations relate to 1) a plant expansion project that was implemented
on the basis of calculated emission data that later proved to be

                                    -4-

<PAGE>

inaccurate, with the result that the project allegedly failed to observe
the federal construction ban and certain "new source review" provisions;
and 2) the subsequent installation of a material recovery unit that is now
alleged to be pollution control equipment for which a permit was required. 
The NOV does not specify the relief that will be sought by EPA, but any
penalties are not expected to be material to the Company.

                             -----------------

                   THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN
           (as approved by the shareholders on October 13, 1992
                    and last amended December 14, 1993)

ARTICLE A -- PURPOSE.

   The purpose of The Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (hereinafter
referred to as the "Plan") is to encourage those employees of The Procter &
Gamble Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and its
subsidiaries who are largely responsible for the long-term success and
development of the business to strengthen the alignment of interests
between employees and the Company's shareholders through the increased
ownership of shares of the Company's Common Stock, and to encourage those
employees to remain in the employ of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
This will be accomplished through the granting to employees of options to
purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company, payment of a portion of
the employees' remuneration in shares of the Common Stock, and the granting
to them by the Company and a subsidiary, if appropriate, of deferred awards
related to the increase in the price of the Common Stock of the Company as
provided by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.

ARTICLE B -- ADMINISTRATION.

   1.  The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee
(hereinafter referred to as the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of
the Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Board"), or such other
committee as may be designated by the Board.  The Committee shall consist
of not less than three (3) members of the Board who are neither officers
nor employees, or members of the Board who are "disinterested persons" as
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(hereinafter referred to as the "1934 Act"), or any successor rule or
definition adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to be
appointed by the Board from time to time and to serve at the discretion of
the Board.

   2.  It shall be the duty of the Committee to administer this Plan in
accordance with its provisions, to report thereon not less than once each
year to the Board and to make such recommendations of amendments or
otherwise as it deem necessary or appropriate.  A decision by a majority of
the Committee shall govern all actions of the Committee.

   3.  Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall
have authority: to grant nonstatutory and incentive stock options; to grant
to recipients stock appreciation rights either freestanding, in tandem with
simultaneously granted stock options, or in parallel with simultaneously
granted stock options; to award a portion of a recipient's remuneration in
shares of Common Stock of the Company subject to such conditions or
restrictions, if any, as the Committee may determine; to determine all the
terms and provisions of the respective stock option, stock appreciation
right, and stock award agreements including setting the dates when each
stock option or stock appreciation right or part thereof may be exercised
and determining the conditions and restrictions, if any, of any shares of
Common Stock acquired through the exercise of any stock option; and to make
all other determinations it deems necessary or advisable for administering
this Plan; provided, however, the Committee shall have the further
authority to:


<PAGE>

   (a)  waive the provisions of Article F, paragraph 1(a);

   (b)  waive the provisions of Article F, paragraph 1(b);

   (c)  waive the provisions of Article G, paragraph 4(a); and

   (d)  impose conditions at time of grant in lieu of those set forth in
        Article G, paragraphs 4 through 7, for nonstatutory stock options,
        stock appreciation rights, and stock award grants which do not
        increase or extend the rights of the recipient,

to take into consideration the differences, limitations, and requirements
of foreign laws or conditions including tax regulations, exchange controls
or investment restrictions, possible unenforceability of any part of this
Plan, or other matters deemed appropriate by it.

   4.  The Committee may establish from time to time such regulations,
provisions, and procedures within the terms of this Plan as, in its
opinion, may be advisable in the administration of this Plan.

   5.  The Committee may designate the Secretary of the Company or other
employees of the Company to assist the Committee in the administration of
this Plan and may grant authority to such persons to execute documents on
behalf of the Committee.

ARTICLE C -- PARTICIPATION.

   The Committee shall select those employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries who, in the opinion of the Committee, have demonstrated a
capacity for contributing in a substantial manner to the success of such
companies and shall determine the number of shares of the Common Stock of
the Company to be transferred under this Plan subject to such conditions or
restrictions as the Committee may determine and the number of shares with
respect to which stock options or stock appreciation rights will be
granted.  The Committee may consult with the Chief Executive, but
nevertheless the Committee has the full authority to act, and the
Committee's actions shall be final.

ARTICLE D -- LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SHARES FOR THE PLAN.

   1.  Unless otherwise authorized by the shareholders, the maximum
aggregate number of shares available for award under this Plan for each
calendar year the Plan is in effect shall be one percent (1%) of the total
issued shares of Common Stock of the Company as of June 30 of the
immediately preceding fiscal year.

   2.  Any of the authorized shares may be used in respect of any of the
types of awards described in this Plan, except that no more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the authorized shares in any calendar year may be
issued as restricted or unrestricted stock and no more than 25,000,000 of
the authorized shares during the term of the Plan may be issued as
incentive stock options.

   3.  Any authorized shares not used in a calendar year shall be
available for awards under this Plan in succeeding calendar years.


<PAGE>

ARTICLE E -- SHARES SUBJECT TO USE UNDER THE PLAN.

   1.  The shares to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of stock
options or stock appreciation rights shall be either authorized but
unissued shares or treasury shares, as determined by the Board.  In the
case of redemption of stock appreciation rights by one of the Company's
subsidiaries, such shares shall be shares acquired by that subsidiary.

   2.  For purposes of this Plan, restricted or unrestricted stock awarded
under the terms of this Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares,
treasury shares, or shares acquired for purposes of the Plan by the Company
or a subsidiary, as determined by the Board.

ARTICLE F -- STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

   1.  In addition to such other conditions as may be established by the
Committee, in consideration of the granting of stock options or stock
appreciation rights under the terms of this Plan, the recipient agrees as
follows:

   (a)  The right to exercise any stock option or stock appreciation right
        shall be conditional upon certification by the recipient at time of
        exercise that the recipient intends to remain in the employ of the
        Company or one of its subsidiaries (except in cases of retirement,
        disability or Special Separation as defined in section 6 of Article
        G) for at least one (1) year following the date of the exercise of
        the stock option or stock appreciation right, and,

   (b)  In order to better protect the goodwill of the Company and its
        subsidiaries and to prevent the disclosure of the Company's or it
        subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential information and
        thereby help insure the long-term success of the business, the
        recipient, without prior written consent of the Company, will not
        engage in any activity or provide any services, whether as a
        director, manager, supervisor, employee, adviser, consultant or
        otherwise, for a period of three (3) years following the date of
        the recipient's termination of employment with the Company, in
        connection with the manufacture, development, advertising,
        promotion, or sale of any product which is the same as or similar
        to or competitive with any products of the Company or its
        subsidiaries (including both existing products as well as products
        known to the recipient, as a consequence of the recipient's
        employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries, to be in
        development):

        (1)    with respect to which the recipient's work has been directly
               concerned at any time during the two (2) years preceding
               termination of employment with the Company or one of its
               subsidiaries or

        (2)    with respect to which during that period of time the
               recipient, as a consequence of the recipient's job
               performance and duties, acquired knowledge of trade secrets
               or other confidential information of the Company or its
               subsidiaries.

        For purposes of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed
        that recipients have knowledge of information they were directly
        exposed to through actual receipt or 

<PAGE>

        review of memos or documents containing such information, or
        through actual attendance at meetings at which such information was
        discussed or disclosed.

   (c)  The provisions of this Article are not in lieu of, but are in
        addition to the continuing obligation of the recipient (which
        recipient hereby acknowledges) to not use or disclose the Company's
        or its subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential information
        known to the recipient until any particular trade secret or
        confidential information become generally known (through no fault
        of the recipient), whereupon the restriction on use and disclosure
        shall cease as to that item.  Information regarding products in
        development, in test marketing or being marketed or promoted in a
        discrete geographic region, which information the Company or one of
        its subsidiaries is considering for broader use, shall not be
        deemed generally known until such broader use is actually
        commercially implemented.  As used in this Article, "generally
        known" means known throughout the domestic U. S. industry or, in
        the case of recipients who have job responsibilities outside of the
        United States, the appropriate foreign country or countries'
        industry.

   (d)  By acceptance of any offered stock option or stock appreciation
        rights granted under the terms of this Plan, the recipient
        acknowledges that if the recipient were, without authority, to use
        or disclose the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' trade secrets
        or confidential information or threaten to do so, the Company or
        one of its subsidiaries would be entitled to injunctive and other
        appropriate relief to prevent the recipient from doing so.  The
        recipient acknowledges that the harm caused to the Company by the
        breach or anticipated breach of this Article is by its nature
        irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily
        susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue.  The
        recipient consents that any interim or final equitable relief
        entered by a court of competent jurisdiction shall, at the request
        of the Company or one of its subsidiaries, be entered on consent
        and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over the recipient,
        without prejudice to any rights either party may have to appeal
        from the proceedings which resulted in any grant of such relief.

   (e)  If any of the provisions contained in this Article shall for any
        reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
        develop after the recipient's acceptance of an offer of the
        granting of stock appreciation rights or stock options, be
        determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad
        as to scope of activity, duration, or territory, the recipient
        agrees to join the Company or any of its subsidiaries in requesting
        such court to construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so
        as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with then applicable
        law.  If any one or more of the terms, provisions, covenants, or
        restrictions of this Article shall be determined by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then
        the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions
        of this Article shall remain in full force and effect and shall in
        no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated.

   2.  The fact that an employee has been granted a stock option or a
stock appreciation right under this Plan shall not limit the right of the
employer to terminate the recipient's employment at any time.  The
Committee is authorized to suspend or terminate any outstanding stock
option or stock appreciation right prior to or after termination of
employment if the 

<PAGE>

Committee determines the recipient has acted significantly contrary to the
best interests of the Company.

   3.  More than one stock option or stock appreciation right may be
granted to any employee under this Plan but the maximum number of shares
with respect to which stock options or stock appreciation rights may be
granted to any employee in any calendar year shall not exceed five percent
(5%) of the number of shares which can be issued or transferred annually
hereunder.

   4.  The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time when the
incentive stock option is exercisable for the first time by an employee
during any calendar year) of the shares for which any employee may be
granted incentive stock options under this Plan and all other stock option
plans of the Company and its subsidiaries in any calendar year shall not
exceed $100,000 (or such other amount as reflected in the limits imposed by
Section 422(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended
from time to time).

   5.  If the Committee grants incentive stock options, all such stock
options shall contain such provisions as permit them to qualify as
"incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as may be amended from time to time.

   6.  With respect to stock options granted in tandem with or parallel to
stock appreciation rights, the exercise of either such stock options or
such stock appreciation rights will result in the simultaneous cancellation
of the same number of tandem or parallel stock appreciation rights or stock
options, as the case may be.

   7.  The exercise price for all stock options and stock appreciation
rights shall be established by the Committee at the time of their grant and
shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value
of the Common Stock of the Company on the date of grant.

ARTICLE G -- EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

   1.  All stock options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder
shall have a maximum life of no more than ten (10) years from the date of
grant.

   2.  No stock options or stock appreciation rights shall be exercisable
within one (1) year from their date of grant, except in the case of the
death of the recipient.

   3.  During the lifetime of the recipient, stock options and stock
appreciation rights may be exercised only by the recipient personally, or,
in the event of the legal incompetence of the recipient, by the recipient's
duly appointed legal guardian.

   4.  In case a recipient of stock options or stock appreciation rights
ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries while
holding an unexercised stock option or stock appreciation right:

   (a)  Any unexercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the
        case of: (1) death of the recipient; (2) any Special Separation (as
        defined in section 6 of this Article G) that occurs more than six
        months from the date the options were granted; or (3) any option as
        to which the Committee has waived, at the time of grant, the
        provisions of this Article G, paragraph 4(a) pursuant to the
        authority granted by Article B, paragraph 3.

   (b)  Any exercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the case
        of death, retirement in accordance with the provisions of any
        appropriate profit sharing or retirement plan of the Company or any
        of its subsidiaries, or Special Separation (as defined in section 6
        of this Article G) of the recipient.

   5.  In the case of the death of a recipient of stock options or stock
appreciation rights while an employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, the persons to whom the stock options or stock appreciation
rights have been transferred by will or the laws of descent and
distribution shall have the privilege of exercising remaining stock
options, stock appreciation rights or parts thereof, whether or not
exercisable on the date of death of such employee, at any time prior to the
expiration date of the stock options or stock appreciation rights.

   6.  Termination of employment under the permanent disability provision
of any appropriate profit sharing or retirement plan of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries shall be deemed the same as retirement.  Special
Separation means any termination of employment, except a termination for
cause, of any person who is not a current or former member of the Executive
Committee of the Company if it is certified in writing by a member of the
Executive Committee of the Company, with the concurrence of the appropriate
Vice President-Human Resources, that the termination should be treated as a
Special Separation under this Plan.  The death of a recipient of stock
options or stock appreciation rights subsequent to retirement or Special
Separation shall not render exercisable stock options or stock appreciation
rights which were unexercisable at the time of the retirement or Special
Separation.  The persons to whom the exercisable stock options or stock
appreciation rights have been transferred by will or the laws of descent
and distribution shall have the privilege of exercising such remaining
stock options, stock appreciation rights or parts thereof, at any time
prior to the expiration date of the stock options or stock appreciation
rights.

   7.  Stock options and stock appreciation rights are not transferable
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  For the
purpose of exercising stock options or stock appreciation rights after the
death of the recipient, the duly appointed executors and administrators of
the estate of the deceased recipient shall have the same rights with
respect to the stock options and stock appreciation rights as legatees or
distributees would have after distribution to them from the recipient's
estate.

   8.  Upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights, the recipient shall
be entitled to receive a redemption differential for each such stock
appreciation right which shall be the difference between the then fair
market value of one share of the Common Stock of the Company and the
exercise price of one stock appreciation right then being exercised.  In
the case of the redemption of stock appreciation rights by a subsidiary of
the Company not located in the United States, the redemption differential
shall be calculated in United States dollars and converted to the
appropriate local currency on the exercise date.  As determined by the
Committee, the redemption differential may be paid in cash, Common Stock of
the Company to be valued at its fair market value on the date of exercise,
any other mode of payment deemed appropriate by the Committee or any
combination thereof.  The number of shares with respect to 

<PAGE>

which stock appreciation rights are being exercised shall not be available
for granting future stock options or stock appreciation rights under this
Plan.

   9.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a stock option
which is being exercised either (a) by an optionee whose retirement is
imminent or who has retired or (b) after the death of the optionee, to be
surrendered, in lieu of exercise, for an amount equal to the difference
between the stock option exercise price and the fair market value of shares
of the Common Stock of the Company on the day the stock option is
surrendered, payment to be made in shares of the Company's Common Stock
which are subject to this Plan valued at their fair market value on such
date, cash, or a combination thereof, in such proportion and upon such
terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee.  The
difference between the number of shares subject to stock options so
surrendered and the number of shares, if any, issued upon such surrender
shall represent shares which shall not be available for granting future
stock options under this Plan.

   10.    Time spent on leave of absence shall be considered as employment
for the purposes of this Plan.  Leave of absence means any period of time
away from work granted to any employee by his or her employer because of
illness, injury, or other reasons satisfactory to the employer.

   11.    The Company reserves the right from time to time to suspend the
exercise of any stock option or stock appreciation right where such
suspension is deemed by it necessary or appropriate for corporate purposes. 
No such suspension shall extend the life of the stock option or stock
appreciation right beyond its expiration date, and in no event will there
be a suspension in the five (5) calendar days immediately preceding the
expiration date.

ARTICLE H -- PAYMENT FOR STOCK OPTIONS.

   Upon the exercise of a stock option, payment in full of the exercise
price shall be made by the optionee.  As determined by the Committee, the
stock option exercise price may be paid for by the optionee either in cash,
shares of the Common Stock of the Company to be valued at their fair market
value on the date of exercise, or a combination thereof.

ARTICLE I -- TRANSFER OF SHARES.

   1.  The Committee may transfer Common Stock of the Company under the
Plan subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee
may determine.  The conditions and restrictions may vary from time to time
and with respect to particular employees or group of employees and may be
set forth in agreements between the Company and the employee or in the
awards of stock to them, all as the Committee determines.  It is
contemplated that the conditions and restrictions established by the
Committee will be consistent with the objectives of this Plan and may be of
the following types.  In giving these examples, it is not intended to
restrict the Committee's authority to impose other restrictions or
conditions, or to waive restrictions or conditions under circumstances
deemed by the Committee to be appropriate and not contrary to the best
interests of the Company.

    (a) Restrictions

<PAGE>

       The employee will not be able to sell, pledge, or dispose of the
       shares during a specified period except in accordance with the
       agreement or award.  Such restrictions will lapse either after a
       period of, for example, five years, or in fifteen or fewer annual
       installments following retirement or termination of employment, as
       the Committee from time to time may determine.  However, upon the
       transfer of shares subject to restrictions, an employee will have
       all incidents of ownership in the shares, including the right to
       dividends (unless otherwise restricted by the Committee), to vote
       the shares, and to make gifts of them to family members (still
       subject to the restrictions).

    (b) Lapse of Restrictions

       In order to have the restrictions lapse, an employee may be
       required to continue in the employ of the Company or a subsidiary
       for a prescribed period of time.  Exemption from this requirement
       may be prescribed in the case of death, disability, or retirement,
       or as otherwise prescribed by the Committee.  In addition, an
       employee may be required, following termination of employment other
       than by retirement or disability, to render limited consulting and
       advisory services and to refrain from conduct deemed contrary to
       the best interests of the Company.

ARTICLE J -- ADJUSTMENTS.

   The amount of shares authorized to be issued annually under this Plan
will be subject to appropriate adjustments in their numbers in the event of
future stock splits, stock dividends, or other changes in capitalization of
the Company occurring after the date of approval of this Plan by the
Company's shareholders to prevent the dilution or enlargement of rights
under this Plan; following any such change, the term "Common Stock" shall
be deemed to refer to such class of shares or other securities as may be
applicable.  The number of shares and exercise prices covered by
outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights shall be adjusted
to give effect to any such stock splits, stock dividends, or other changes
in the capitalization.

ARTICLE K -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

   1.  The Board may, at any time, repeal this Plan or may amend it from
time to time except that no such amendment may amend this paragraph,
increase the annual aggregate number of shares subject to this Plan, reduce
the price at which stock options or stock appreciation rights may be
granted, exercised, or surrendered, alter the class of employees eligible
to receive stock options, or increase the percentage of shares authorized
to be transferred as restricted or unrestricted stock.  The recipient of
awards under this Plan and the Company shall be bound by any such
amendments as of their effective dates, but if any outstanding stock
options or stock appreciation rights are affected, notice thereof shall be
given to the holders of such stock options and stock appreciation rights
and such amendments shall not be applicable to such holder without his or
her written consent.  If this Plan is repealed in its entirety, all
theretofore granted unexercised stock options or stock appreciation rights
shall continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms and shares
subject to conditions or restrictions transferred pursuant to this Plan
shall continue to be subject to such conditions or restrictions.

   2.  In the case of an employee of a subsidiary company, performance
under this Plan, including the transfer of shares of the Company, may be by
the subsidiary.  Nothing in this Plan 

<PAGE>

shall affect the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate the
employment of any employee with or without cause.  None of the
participants, either individually or as a group, and no beneficiary or
other person claiming under or through any participant, shall have any
right, title,  or interest in any shares of the Company purchased or
reserved for the purpose of this Plan except as to such shares, if any, as
shall have been granted or transferred to him or her.  Nothing in this Plan
shall preclude the issuance or transfer of shares of the Company to
employees under any other plan or arrangement now or hereafter in effect.

   3.  "Subsidiary" means any company in which fifty percent (50%) or more
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company.  In addition, the Board may
designate for participation in this Plan as a "subsidiary," except for the
granting of incentive stock options, those additional companies affiliated
with the Company in which the Company's direct or indirect stock ownership
is less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all
classes of such company's stock.

ARTICLE L -- CONSENT.

   Every recipient of a stock option, stock appreciation right, or
transfer of shares pursuant to this Plan shall be bound by the terms and
provisions of this Plan and of the stock option, stock appreciation right,
or transfer of shares agreement referable thereto, and the acceptance of
any stock option, stock appreciation right, or transfer of shares pursuant
to this Plan shall constitute a binding agreement between the recipient and
the Company and its subsidiaries and any successors in interest to any of
them.  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Ohio, United States of America.

ARTICLE M -- DURATION OF PLAN.

   This Plan will terminate on July 14, 2002 unless a different
termination date is fixed by the shareholders or by action of the Board of
Directors, but no such termination shall affect the prior rights under this
Plan of the Company (or any subsidiary) or of anyone to whom stock options
or stock appreciation rights were granted prior thereto or to whom shares
have been transferred prior to such termination.

                              --------------

                           RICHARDSON-VICKS INC.
                  SPECIAL STOCK EQUIVALENT INCENTIVE PLAN
               --------------------------------------------

                 (As authorized by the Board of Directors
                      of The Procter & Gamble Company
      and adopted by the Board of Directors of Richardson-Vicks Inc.
                               on 12/31/85.)


ARTICLE A - THE PLAN AND ITS OBJECTIVES

     In retaining top caliber personnel, it is important for Richardson-Vicks
Inc. (the "Company") to be in a position to pay a part or all of the
additional remuneration portion of an employee's aggregate remuneration in
Procter & Gamble Common Stock equivalents ("Contingent Stock Awards").  The
granting of Contingent Stock Awards will strengthen the identity of their
interests with those of other shareholders.  Only those executives will
participate in the Plan who will substantially contribute to the success and
development of the business and upon whom the future of the Company chiefly
depends.

ARTICLE B - ADMINISTRATION

     1.   The Company, with the concurrence of the appropriate officers of
The Procter & Gamble Company ("Procter & Gamble") as authorized by the Board
of Directors of Procter & Gamble (the "P&G Board"), has determined those
employees and officers of the Company initially eligible to participate in
the Plan effective as of January 1, 1986, the amount of their participation
and the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to Contingent Stock
Awards granted to such participants pursuant to the Plan, such terms,
conditions and restrictions to be set forth in a Statement of Conditions and
Restrictions (the "Statement") to accompany each grant.  Future grants may be
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the preceding sentence.

     2.   A contingent Stock Awards Committee appointed by the Board of the
Company with the concurrence of the P&G Board as set forth in paragraph 1
above, (the "Committee") will have full authority in the operation,
administration and interpretation of the Plan and may issue rules and
regulations governing the administration of the Plan.  The Committee shall be
composed of three members, at least two of whom shall be senior executive
officers of the Company as of October 24, 1985, (the executive officers so
serving being hereinafter referred to as the "RVI Executives"), or their
successors designated by the RVI Executive(s) and approved by the Board of
Directors of the 

<PAGE>

Company (the "RVI Board"), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
The Committee may designate employees of the Company or of Procter & Gamble
to assist the Committee in the administration of the Plan and may grant
authority to such persons to execute documents upon behalf of the Committee.

     3.   The Committee may consult with the participants, but nevertheless
the Committee has full authority to act and the Committee's action shall be
final.

ARTICLE C - SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

     The shares of Procter & Gamble Common Stock (the "Common Stock")
transferred under this Plan will be authorized but unissued shares, treasury
shares or shares acquired for purposes of the Plan by Procter & Gamble or the
Company.

ARTICLE D - LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF CONTINGENT STOCK AWARDS FOR THE PLAN

     1.   Subject to adjustment pursuant to Article D, paragraph 2 below, the
aggregate number of Contingent Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall not
exceed 150,000 units, with each unit representing one share of Common Stock.

     2.   Contingent Stock Awards granted or reserved for purposes of the
Plan will be subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of future stock
splits, stock dividends or other changes in capitalization; following any
such change, the term "Contingent Stock Awards" or "Common Stock," as used in
the Plan, shall be deemed to refer to such interests, class of shares or
other securities as may be applicable.

ARTICLE E - GENERAL PROVISIONS

     The granting of Contingent Stock Awards or the transfer of shares of
Common Stock under the Plan shall be by the Company.  Nothing in the Plan
shall affect the right of the Company to terminate the employment of any
employee with or without cause (subject to possible acceleration of the lapse
of conditions and restrictions in accordance with the provisions of the
Statement).  None of the participants, either individually or as a group, and
no beneficiary or other person claiming under or through any participant,
shall have any right, title or interest in any Contingent Stock Awards except
as to such Contingent Stock Awards, if any, as shall have been granted to
him.  Any Contingent Stock Awards reserved for purposes of the Plan shall,
unless and until granted pursuant to the Plan, constitute and remain the
property of the Company.  Nothing in the Plan shall preclude the issuance or
transfer of shares of Common Stock to employees under any other plan or
arrangement now or hereafter in effect.

<PAGE>

ARTICLE F - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     The Plan or the Statement may at any time or from time to time be
amended by the RVI Board with the concurrence of the P&G Board in the manner
set forth in Article B, paragraph 1 above, except that no such amendment may
amend this Article or Article B, paragraph 2 or may increase the aggregate
limitations on the number of Contingent Stock Awards as set forth above, or
may, without the written consent of the participant, adversely affect the
rights of anyone to whom Contingent Stock Awards have been granted prior to
such amendment.  The Plan may be terminated at any time by vote of a majority
of the entire RVI Board, but no such termination shall affect the rights of
the Company or of anyone to whom Contingent Stock Awards have been granted
prior to such termination.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

Your company made strong progress in fiscal 1993/94 against its four
primary business objectives: increasing the flow of innovative new products
to the market place; expanding the global presence of P&G brands; offering
better value to consumers; and increasing the efficiency and productivity
of our operations.
     The Combination of these and many other efforts by our superb P&G
organization produced another year of healthy growth in volume and
earnings.
     Net earnings for fiscal year 1993/94 achieved a record level of $2.2
billion, or $3.09 per common share.  This compares to a loss of $.7 billion
in 1992/93, when results were significantly reduced by a provision for
restructuring and the prior years' effect of accounting changes.
     Excluding these charges from our year-ago results, 1993/94 earnings
were up 10%, equalling the average growth rate over the last 35 years. 
Earnings growth for 1993/94 was depressed 5% by a $102 million charge to
write off the option portion of two interest rate swaps.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

- - - NET EARNINGS were $2.3 billion, up 15% over earnings of $2.0 billion in
1992/93, excluding the unusual items in both years.

- - - EARNINGS PER SHARE, excluding unusual items in both years, were $3.24, up
15%.

- - - AFTER-TAX PROFIT MARGIN in 1993/94 was 7.6%, excluding the derivatives
write-off, the highest level in 21 years.

- - - UNIT VOLUME, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew
5%, with International up 7% and the United States up 4%.  Every business
sector and geographic region increased unit volume versus year ago.

- - - NET SALES of $30.3 billion were about even with the prior year.  Less
favorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales 4%.  The
divestiture of our pulp and 100% juice businesses and lower pricing reduced
sales 1%.  Excluding these effects, sales would have been up 5%, in line
with volume growth.

- - - CASH FLOW from operations set a new record at $3.6 billion.  The
improvement reflects higher earnings and continued reduction in working
capital.  This enabled the Company to reduce debt and further strengthen
its financial condition.

- - - DIVIDENDS increased 13% to $1.24 per share.  Beginning with the August
1994 dividend, the annual dividend rate will be raised an additional 13% to
$1.40 per share, marking the 39th consecutive year of increased dividend
payments.

- - - RETURN ON EQUITY was 23%, excluding unusual items.  This is the highest
level in 44 years, reflecting improved profitability and the write-off of
underperforming assets included in the 1993 restructuring reserve.

P&G ACHIEVING RESTRUCTURING GOALS

Among the most important achievements of 1993/94 was the Company's
exceptional progress toward our plant consolidation and "Strengthening
Global Effectiveness" (SGE) overhead reduction goals.  Last year, P&G set
aside $1.5 billion from net earnings to cover the cost of a worldwide
restructuring that would result in a 20% reduction in the number of
manufacturing plants and a 12% reduction in worldwide enrollment.
     The Company is making steady progress toward its restructuring goals
and is already seeing benefits.  In 1993/94, we achieved about a third of
the $500 million ongoing after-tax savings goal for this program.  These
savings have enabled us to reduce pricing to provide better value for
consumers and contributed to record margins.

U.S. BUSINESS CONTINUES HEALTHY GROWTH TREND

The U.S. business had an excellent year in 1993/94.
     Earnings were up 9% and unit volume was up 4%, even though total
consumer purchases in our categories grew only 1% during the year.

- - - LAUNDRY AND HOUSEHOLD CLEANING'S Hard Surface Cleaners business rolled
out eight new products and turned in its strongest year of volume growth
since the introduction of Mr. Clean in 1959.  Fabric conditioners also
turned in record volume behind new products on Bounce and Ultra Downy
triple-concentrate.

- - - BEAUTY CARE built volume in Hair Care with Pantene Pro-V and new shampoo,
conditioning and styling products and packaging on Vidal Sassoon.
     Cover Girl strengthened its market leadership with continued share
growth, though unit volume declined for cosmetics and fragrances overall,
largely due to reductions in market size and the discontinuation of the
unprofitable Clarion brand.  Max Factor International completed the
introduction of an all-new line of cosmetics worldwide and early consumer
response has been encouraging.
     We expect the planned acquisition of Giorgio Beverly Hills Inc.,
announced in July 1994, to strengthen P&G's cosmetics and fragrances
business.  This acquisition will give the Company a strong foothold in the
U.S. fine fragrance market, with leadership brands and a strong management
team.

- - - HEALTH CARE'S respiratory business grew both volume and market share,
largely with the introduction of Vicks DayQuil Allergy and DayQuil Sinus.
     In addition, P&G entered the over-the-counter analgesics category with
Aleve.  This new P&G brand, a joint venture with Syntex, is a non-
prescription strength, fast-acting form of the medicine in Naprosyn, the
number one selling brand in its class for 10 years.
     Our pharmaceutical business delivered strong volume growth in 1993/94,
led by its Didro-Kit therapy for osteoporosis which is now approved for use
in nine countries outside the U.S. Asacol, a treatment for ulcerative
colitis, achieved category leadership in the U.S. in the past year.  And
early results were very encouraging for Ziac, a new prescription blood
pressure medication that P&G Pharmaceuticals is marketing with Lederle
Laboratories.

- - - PAPER'S Tissue and Towel category achieved outstanding results, exceeding
last year's record volume and

     (Stylized picture of globe with caption "Unit volume was up 4% and
     earnings were up 9% versus 1992/93 for the U.S. business.")

<PAGE>

profit performance.  This marks the seventh consecutive year of volume and
profit growth for the Category.
     Our Bath Tissue business completed national expansion of Charmin Ultra
and our Paper Towel business began national expansion of Bounty Extra
Durable last quarter.
     Both of these introductions utilize a proprietary papermaking
technology which enables us to improve absorbency, softness and strength
while reducing manufacturing costs.
     Although diaper volume declined for the year, we've taken steps to
improve consumer value through lower prices and have accelerated the pace
of product innovation.
     During the year, we applied our new "curly fiber" technology to
Pampers and Luvs, producing a diaper that is 50% thinner and more
absorbent.
     Pampers Trainers was introduced nationally and, as the fiscal year
ended, two new products entered test markets--Pampers Stretch and Luvs with
Dri-Weave.  Pampers Stretch has an elastic side panel for better fit and
the new Luvs diaper has a dri-weave topsheet similar to the one on Always
that keeps wetness away from the skin.

- - - FOOD AND BEVERAGE continued to make excellent profit progress and in
1993/94 achieved its longstanding goal of delivering profit margins in line
with the Company's average.
     The business is growing behind products such as Sunny Delight juice
drink, which is now one of the Company's 10 largest U.S. brands, and
Pringles potato crisps, which delivered strong growth in the U.S. and
abroad.  Pringles is now P&G's biggest export to international markets.

INTERNATIONAL BUILDS WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP THROUGH PRODUCT INNOVATION

Despite sluggish economic conditions in key market, International had
another good year in 1993/94.  Every region achieved volume gains. 
Overall, unit volume was up 7%.
     Acquisitions added another three percentage points, bringing
International's total volume growth to 10% above the prior year.  Volume
growth and improved profit margins, reflecting good cost control, led to a
15% increase in earnings.
     As in the U.S., International growth reflects a steady stream of
product innovations, complemented by geographic expansions and better
consumer value.

- - - IN EUROPE, P&G's largest International business, the laundry category
continued to build share with the introduction of a major product
improvement for oily and greasy stains on market-leading Ariel.  While the
European laundry market remains intensely competitive, we are meeting this
challenge through continued product innovation.

- - - EUROPEAN HEALTH AND BEAUTY CARE achieved market leadership for the first
time in shampoo--behind Pantene Pro-V.  Europe also made significant gains
in Cosmetics and Fragrances, increasing volume behind the successful
launches of Boss Elements and Roma Uomo fragrances and continued good
performance by Ellen Betrix cosmetics in Germany and Max Factor
International in the United Kingdom.

- - - EUROPEAN PAPER recorded strong growth led by Always, the region's leading
feminine protection business.  Europe now sells 38% of P&G's worldwide
volume in feminine

     (Caption in second paragraph stating "The Company is making steady
     progress toward its restructuring goals and is already seeing

                                                                          3

protection and diaper products.  During 1993/94, the European organization
introduced Always Pantiliners into much of the region as well as consumer-
preferred Pampers Baby Dry, Pampers Ultra Dry Thins and Pampers Trainers.

- - - NEW TISSUE/TOWEL BUSINESS--More recently, P&G expanded its growth
opportunities in Europe by entering the $5.5 billion tissue/towel market
with the July 1994 acquisition of VP-Schickedanz.  This is the Company's
first move into the tissue business outside North America.  VPS has an
experienced organization with modern manufacturing facilities and high
quality, profitable brands such as Tempo, the leading European paper
handkerchief, and Bess bath tissue, the leading brand in Germany.  Based on
proven technology and successful brands in the U.S., along with significant
growth potential in a market where per capita tissue usage is well below
U.S. levels, we expect to significantly build this business over time.

- - - EASTERN EUROPE continued its strong growth with volume up 20% in 1993/94. 
Laundry detergents are the Company's largest business in this region.  P&G
is the market leader in the Czech and Slovak Republics, with brands such as
Tix, Tide and Ariel.  In Russia, Tide is the best-selling western laundry
detergent after only six months on the market.
     Pampers is the number one diaper in Hungary and Poland and is a strong
second in the Czech and Slovak Republics.  P&G also strengthened its
dentifrice business in 1993/94.  Blend-aMed is the number one dentifrice
brand in Hungary and Poland.

- - - ASIA/PACIFIC recorded 25% volume growth, led by gains in China, Taiwan,
Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and India.
     Japan remains the largest business in Asia/Pacific and set new volume
records, despite a tough competitive climate and weak economic conditions. 
The introduction of the new Vidal Sassoon hair care line was a major factor
in the broad-based growth in this region.  Feminine protection products
were also an important contributor.
     China was the fastest-growing country in the region.  P&G is China's
market leader in hair care and, with the completion of the three joint
ventures during this fiscal year, is now the largest detergent manufacturer
in China, as well.  Our other Chinese businesses--Skin Care, Feminine
Protection and Personal Cleansing--are also growing.

- - - LATIN AMERICA continued broad-based volume growth. Mexico delivered the
biggest volume gains on existing businesses, while acquisitions played an
important role in the growth of other Latin American markets.
     The Company strengthened its position in the feminine protection
category with the acquisition of the Higibras/ProHigiene companies in
Brazil.  In addition, we expanded our core laundry and dishwashing business
through acquisition of the Quimica and Llauro companies in Argentina.

- - - CANADA continued to build its Laundry and Cleaning business with the
introduction of Tide with Advanced Color Guard.  Paper led Canada in unit
volume growth as P&G's technologies were applied to the Royale bath tissue,
kitchen towel and facial tissue products.

P&G POSITIONED FOR THE FUTURE

Never has the Company been as well positioned in as many product categories
and in as many regions of the world as it is today.
     The key to our success is and always has been our ability to develop
and advance our people.  That's why we're particularly proud of the
Opportunity 2000 Award just given to P&G by the United States Department of
Labor.  This award, which is presented to a single company each year,
recognizes the efforts of men and women throughout our organization to
promote and advance employees of all origins and backgrounds.
     P&G has the strongest group of employees in any consumer goods company
in the world--people who are characterized by their innovation, speed and
ability to work together across both functional and geographic boundaries.
     These characteristics have always been our Company's greatest
strength, and will continue to be Procter & Gamble's most valued resource
in the years ahead.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Procter & Gamble Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Procter
& Gamble Company and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, retained earnings, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the companies' management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the companies
at June 30, 1994 and 1993 and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
     As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective July 1,
1992, the Company changed its methods of accounting for other post
retirement benefits and income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The financial statements include the
   accounts of The Procter & Gamble Company and its majority-owned
   subsidiaries. Investments in 20% to 50% owned affiliates in which
   significant management control is exercised are included at original
   cost adjusted for the change in equity since acquisition. Other
   investments are carried at cost. 

   ACCOUNTING CHANGES: Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Accounting for
   Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The new Statement requires
   accrual of postretirement health care and life insurance benefits
   during an employee's years of active service rather than on the
   previous pay-as-you-go basis during the retirement years. 
     Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The new
   Statement requires deferred taxes on the Balance Sheet to be stated at
   enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these balances reverse,
   i.e. when taxes actually will be paid or recovered. Previously,
   deferred taxes were based on the enacted tax rate when these amounts
   were first recognized. 
     Effective July 1, 1994, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
   Benefits, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
   Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The
   effects of adoption of these new standards are not expected to be
   material. 

   CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and liabilities denominated in most
   foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end
   exchange rates and related gains and losses are reflected in
   shareholders' equity. Significant currencies include the German mark,
   Belgian franc, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen, with
   any related exposure managed primarily through local financing. Gains
   and losses from foreign currency transactions and translation of
   balance sheets in highly inflationary economies are determined based on
   historical or current exchange rates as appropriate, and are included
   in earnings. Losses included in net earnings for 1994, 1993 and 1992
   were $27, $42 and $50, respectively. 

   CASH EQUIVALENTS: Highly liquid investments with maturities of three
   months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.

   INVENTORY VALUATION: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
   market. Cost for inventories is primarily determined by the last-in,
   first-out method or the average cost method. 
     Futures contracts are purchased primarily to hedge certain
   agricultural commodity requirements. Gains and losses on these
   contracts are included in earnings when the related products are sold.

   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The cost of intangible assets is
   amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods
   benefited, but not exceeding 40 years with an average remaining life of
   28 years. The realizability of goodwill and other intangibles is
   evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
   inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is based on
   various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections
   that incorporate, as applicable, the impact on existing company
   businesses. The analyses necessarily involve significant management
   judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform
   within projections. Historically, the Company has generated sufficient
   returns from acquired businesses to recover the cost of their
   intangible assets. 

   DEPRECIATION: For financial accounting purposes, depreciation is
   calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
   the assets.

   OTHER EXPENSES: Research and development expenses are charged to
   earnings in the year incurred and were $1,059, $956 and $861 for the
   years ending June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992. 

   NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Net earnings less preferred dividends
   (net of related tax benefits) are divided by the average number of
   common shares outstanding during the year to derive net earnings per
   common share. Fully diluted earnings per share are calculated using the
   treasury stock method and include an adjustment for preferred stock
   dividend requirements. 

   RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain reclassifications of prior years' amounts
   have been made to conform with the current year presentation. 

2. PROVISION FOR RESTRUCTURING
   A restructuring provision of $2,705 which reduced after-tax earnings by
   $1,746 or $2.57 per share, was established in fiscal 1993. A charge of
   $2,402 covers a worldwide restructuring effort to optimize product
   supply systems and reduce overhead costs, and a $303 charge related to
   the divestiture of the 100% juice business. The provision includes
   costs associated with the closure or disposal of facilities, employee
   separation and exit from certain non-strategic businesses. 
     The restructuring provision was determined based on estimates
   prepared at the time the restructuring actions were approved by
   management and the Board of Directors. The cost of completing the
   restructuring program is expected to approximate the original
   estimates. 

3. ACQUISITIONS
   In fiscal 1992 the Company purchased Revlon, Inc.'s worldwide Max
   Factor and Betrix lines of cosmetics and fragrances for $1,025, net of
   cash acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets of $927.
   Other acquisitions accounted for as purchases totaled $295, $138, and
   $215 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The increase in goodwill and
   other intangible assets amounted to $209, $57, and $93 in those years.
     The pro forma full year effect of the above acquisitions on
   consolidated earnings would not have been material in the respective
   years.

   The following payments are required during the next five fiscal years:
   1995-$494; 1996-$468; 1997-$416; 1998-$322; and 1999-$293.

   The fair value of the underlying long-term debt, excluding amounts due
   within one year, was $5,205 and $5,656 at June 30, 1994 and 1993,
   respectively. 
     Certain commercial paper balances have been classified as long-term
   debt. The Company has the intent and ability to renew the commercial
   paper obligations on a long-term basis and has entered into swap
   arrangements that convert them to fixed rate obligations.

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
   The Company is subject to market rate risk from exposure to changes in
   interest rates and currency exchange rates and enters into various
   financial instrument transactions to manage these exposures. Financial
   instruments used for these purposes are evaluated against the Company's
   policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices,
   and are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity
   analyses. 

   INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS
   The Company's financing and cash management activities entail market
   rate risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company
   assesses the exposure of its overall financing position on a net basis,
   after considering the extent to which variable rate liabilities can be
   offset with variable rate assets, typically cash equivalents and
   marketable securities. The Company's objective is to optimize interest
   expense consistent with maintaining an acceptable level of exposure to
   the risk of interest rate fluctuation. In order to achieve this
   objective, the Company targets a mix of fixed and variable rate debt
   based on an assessment of interest rate trends. To obtain this mix in a
   cost efficient manner, the Company primarily utilizes interest rate
   swaps, including foreign currency interest rate swaps, that have the
   effect of converting specific debt obligations of the Company from
   fixed to variable rate, or vice versa, as required. Amounts due to or
   from the counterparties to interest rate swaps are reflected in
   interest expense in the periods in which they accrue. 
     A portion of interest rate exposure is managed through the use of
   options to manage the Company's overall risk profile and reduce
   interest expense. When using written option contracts, the Company
   receives a premium in exchange for providing a counterparty the right
   to enter into a swap. Gains and losses on such options are recognized
   currently. The notional amounts of such instruments were $1,094 and
   $845 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The fair values were $40
   at June 30, 1994 and $14 at June 30, 1993, reflecting the approximate
   cost to terminate the options. 
     The net effect of interest rate instruments on interest expense for
   1994 and 1993 was insignificant, but this measurement does not capture
   the value to the Company of managing to a targeted mix of fixed and
   variable rate debt. 
     The option portion of the two out-of-policy leveraged interest rate
   swaps entered into during 1994 were closed in the January-March
   quarter. The related $157 charge in the quarter to close these options
   is reflected in other income/expense, net. Leveraged options can
   magnify the impact of interest rate changes. At June 30, 1994 no such
   instruments were in our portfolio and it is the Company's intent not to
   enter such leveraged contracts in the future. 
     Based on the Company's overall variable rate exposure at June 30,
   1994, including interest rate swaps and options, a 300 basis point
   interest rate change would not have a material effect on earnings. 
     The following information includes all interest rate instruments. The
   notional amount is the reference point for determining amounts due or
   receivable under the contracts. The fair value approximates the cost to
   settle the outstanding contracts. The carrying value includes the net
   amount due to counterparties under swap contracts, the marked-to-market
   value of written options, and currency translation associated with
   currency interest rate swaps. 

                                                                         23

     The estimated unrealized losses shown above represent the incremental
   charge to earnings to immediately settle all interest rate swaps.
   However, it is the Company's current intention to leave these
   instruments outstanding until maturity over various periods extending
   to the year 2004, in which case no incremental charge to earnings will
   be realized. 

   CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS
   The Company is subject to market rate risk from exposure to changes in
   currency exchange rates primarily in three areas: commercial
   transactions, intercompany financings and net investments in foreign
   subsidiaries. 
     The primary purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging
   activities is to protect against the risk that local currency cash
   flows associated with purchase transactions will be adversely affected
   by changes in exchange rates. Although this foreign currency exposure
   is managed locally, corporate policy prescribes the range of hedging
   activity into which the subsidiary operations may enter. To execute
   this policy, the Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and
   options with durations of generally less than twelve months. The impact
   of changes in the value of these instruments typically offsets changes
   in the value of the underlying transactions. For accounting purposes,
   gains and losses on option contracts that hedge identifiable
   anticipated transactions and on forward contracts that hedge firm
   commitments are included in the measurement of the related transaction.
   Gains and losses on instruments used for other purposes are recognized
   currently. 
     The Company manages its foreign exchange exposure associated with
   intercompany financing transactions primarily using foreign currency
   swaps. Gains and losses on such instruments mitigate the impact on
   earnings of currency exchange rate changes on the underlying
   transactions. 
     The impact of net asset exposures related to investments in foreign
   subsidiaries are managed primarily through local currency financing,
   and by foreign currency denominated debt issued by the parent company.
   As discussed in the interest rate instruments section, the Company has
   also entered into currency interest rate swaps, which effectively
   convert the principal and interest cash flows of certain existing debt
   to foreign currency obligations. The currency translation associated
   with these obligations is designated as a hedge of the net investment
   in the foreign subsidiaries and reflected in the currency translation
   adjustment in shareholders' equity. 
     Currency instruments outstanding at June 30, 1994 were as follows:
 
   ( ) = Liability                      Notional Amount   Carrying Value
   ____________________________________________________________________
   Forward contracts                        $1,873            $ (10)

<PAGE>

   The aggregate notional amount of currency instruments with off-balance
   sheet risk at June 30, 1993 was $2,409. The aggregate notional amount
   of currency instruments outstanding at June 30, 1994 increased over the
   prior year primarily due to an increased level of transaction hedging
   activity by our international subsidiaries, a timing change related to
   certain purchased option contracts, and the impact of a weaker dollar
   at year end which increased the notional value in dollars. The major
   currency exposures hedged by the Company include the German mark,
   Japanese yen and British pound sterling. 
     The aggregate fair value of currency instruments at June 30, 1994 and
   1993 included the following unrealized amounts: $11 in net gains ($16
   in gains, offset by $5 in losses), and $17 in net gains ($36 in gains,
   offset by $19 in losses), respectively. 

   OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
   The carrying value of other financial instruments approximated fair
   value at June 30, 1994 and 1993. 

   CREDIT RISK
   Credit risk arising from the inability of a counterparty to meet the
   terms of the contracts is generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
   which the counterparties' obligations exceed the obligations of the
   Company. It is the Company's policy to only enter into financial
   instruments with a diversity of creditworthy counterparties. Therefore,
   the Company does not expect to incur credit losses on financial
   instruments. 

   MARKET VALUATION METHODS
   The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments presented
   have been determined using available market information and valuation
   methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow analysis. Such estimates
   require considerable judgments in interpreting market data, and changes
   in assumptions or estimation methods may significantly affect the fair
   value estimates.

   of common shares issued pursuant to employee stock option and
   remuneration plans and amounted to $83, $112 and $99 for the years
   ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The transfer to
   common shares and related expenses of the two-for-one stock split
   reduced additional paid-in capital by $342 in 1992. 

   CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS credited/(charged) to shareholders'
   equity amounted to $36, ($211) and $168 during the years ended June 30,

   The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership
   Plan is the largest plan and covers most employees in the United
   States. Annual credits to participants' accounts are based on
   individual base salary and years of service. The total credited to all
   accounts does not exceed 15% of total salaries and wages of
   participants. Within this plan, a leveraged employee stock ownership
   trust borrowed $1 billion in 1989 and the Company has guaranteed this
   debt. The proceeds were used to buy Series A ESOP Convertible Class A
   Preferred Stock and shares are allocated each year to individual
   accounts. 
     Principal and interest payments of $117 on the borrowed funds were
   paid each fiscal year by the trust from dividends on preferred shares
   and cash payments from the Company as follows:

   OTHER RETIREE BENEFITS
   The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits
   for substantially all of the Company's domestic employees who become
   eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service
   requirements. Generally, the health care plans require contributions
   from retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses reduced by
   deductibles and other coverages. Retiree contributions change annually
   in line with medical cost trends.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)


     In 1990, The P&G Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership
   Plan borrowed $1,000 which is guaranteed and carried as debt by the
   Company. The proceeds were used to buy plan assets of 19.142 million
   shares of Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock of the
   Company for the purpose of partially funding retiree medical benefits.
   The fair values of the shares at June 30, 1994 and 1993 were $1,022 and
   $1,000. There were also other employee benefit trust assets of $40 and
   $21 on June 30, 1994 and 1993. Interest payments on the loan amounted
   to $94, $94 and $101 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, with $79 funded each year
   by preferred stock dividends and the remainder by Company cash
   payments. The preferred stock dividends were presented as a reduction
   of interest expense in 1992; beginning in 1993, concurrent with the
   adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106,
   Accounting For Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, these
   dividends were considered a reduction of benefit expense. 
     Effective July 1, 1992, the Company implemented SFAS No. 106, which
   requires earlier recognition of costs on an accrual basis rather than
   the previous cash, or pay-as-you-go, basis. The effect of the
   accounting change on prior years, or accumulated benefit obligation,
   was $1,422, or $900 after tax, at July 1, 1992. The accumulated benefit
   obligation and net liability at year-end were:

     follows:
                                                            1994    1993

       *Assumed at June 30, 1994 to decline gradually to 5% in 2006 and
        thereafter. Assumed at June 30, 1993 to decline gradually to 6% in
        2008 and thereafter. 

     The pre-tax effect of a 1% increase in the assumed health care cost
   trend rate would increase the accumulated benefit obligations at June
   30, 1994 and 1993 by approximately $185 and $243, along with increases
   of $33 and $34 in the 1994 and 1993 annual costs.

     million after-tax charge for writing off the option portion of two
     interest rate swap contracts. In the previous year, an after-tax loss
     of $656 million was recorded due to two unusual items: restructuring
     reserves totaling $1,746 million after-tax, and the prior years'
     effects of two accounting changes amounting to $925 million. Excluding
     these unusual items in both years, net earnings would have been $2,313
     million in 1994, up 15% over earnings of $2,015 million in the
     previous year. Foreign exchange rates reduced net earnings by less
     than 3%. 
       Net sales for the year just ended were $30.3 billion, about even
     with sales of $30.4 billion in the previous year. Growth in unit
     volume increased net sales by 5%. This increase was offset by less
     favorable foreign exchange rates, 4%, and the divestiture of our pulp
     and 100% juice businesses and lower selling prices, 1%. 
       Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide unit volumes were
     up 5%, 4% in the United States and 7% in International. Including
     acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide unit volume would be up 5%,
     with U.S. up 1% and International up 10%. 
       Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was 57.3%, which
     compares with 58.1% for the preceding year. Restructuring savings
     contributed .2% of this .8% decline as plant sourcing savings from
     lower depreciation and enrollment reductions are beginning to be
     realized. 
       Marketing, administrative and other operating expenses were 30.9% of
     sales, down from 31.5% in the previous year which can entirely be
     ascribed to restructuring savings, primarily from enrollment
     reductions. 
       Operating income, excluding restructuring reserves in the prior
     year, was up 13%, and pretax operating margins were 11.8% compared to
     10.4% a year ago. 
       Interest expenses decreased $70 million from the previous year due
     to lower borrowing rates and lower debt outstanding. Other
     income/expense, net decreased $197 million from the prior year
     reflecting the $157 million loss on two interest swaps this past year
     and $41 million one-time profit in the previous year from the sale of
     businesses. 
       The effective tax rate was 33.9% for 1994, which compares with 22.9%
     for 1993. The 1993 restructuring reserve reduced pre-tax earnings
     significantly and accentuated the percent impact of certain cost
     elements not tax affected at the 34% U.S. statutory rate. Excluding
     the restructuring reserve, the 1993 effective tax rate would have been
     34.0%.

</TABLE>





       In the following year-to-year comparison of geographic and business
     segments, the previous year's earnings have been adjusted upward to
     exclude the cost impact of restructuring reserves and all volume
     comparisons exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestures to more
     comparably present on-going results of the year just ended with those
     of the prior year. 
       In the United States, after-tax earnings were up 9% versus the
     previous year. Net profit margins improved to a record 11.3% with
     restructuring benefits and other cost improvements contributing to the
     increase over the previous year's 10.1% margin. Unit volume increased
     4%, while net sales declined 2%, primarily due to the divestiture of
     the pulp and 100% juice businesses and, to a lesser degree, lower
     pricing. 
       Total International after-tax earnings were up 15% over the previous
     year's results with net profit margins improving by 14%, from 4.2% to
     4.8%. International unit volume increased 7%, and net sales were up
     just 1% from the prior year due primarily to the impact of exchange
     rates. 
       Net earnings in Europe were up 24% on a unit volume gain of 5%
     primarily due to lower product cost. Net sales were down 6% due to
     exchange rates. Excluding exchange effects, sales in Europe would have
     been up 5%. In the balance of International, net earnings were up 6%
     on a unit volume increase of 9%. Net sales were up 11%. 
       Worldwide laundry and cleaning products earnings were up 6% on unit
     volume growth of 3%, primarily in the U.S. Unit shipment increases in
     the global laundry and fabric conditioner categories accounted for the
     largest increases in unit volumes shipped, while hard surface cleaners
     led the U.S. in the percentage increase of units shipped. Net sales
     were down 3% due to exchange rate effects and lower pricing. 
       Personal Care earnings were up 18% on an 8% unit volume increase.
     The global hair care business contributed about 50% of the unit volume
     growth largely due to the growth of Pantene Pro-V and Vidal Sassoon.
     The Personal Care net sales increase of 2% was depressed by the impact
     of exchange rates and lower pricing. 
       Food and Beverage earnings were up 45% to a record $371 million,
     importantly due to the full year effect of the 100% juice divestiture
     in fiscal 1993. The profit margin was 11%, in line with the Company
     average. Unit volume was up 1% due largely to the growth of Sunny
     Delight juice in the U.S. and Pringles worldwide. 

                                                                         33

     ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION (continued)
     
     The recent crop freezes in Brazil will reduce the supply of coffee
     which has resulted in higher green coffee bean prices. The freeze did
     not negatively impact earnings in the year just ended. However, higher
     selling prices could contract the size of the coffee market in 1994/95
     and beyond. Although this could negatively impact coffee profits, the
     effect is not expected to be material to the Company's earnings. 
       Pulp and Chemicals earnings and sales declined substantially due to
     the sale of all but the timberland portion of our pulp business. This
     resulted in a total decline of $38 million in earnings and $422
     million in sales. The sale of the timberlands was concluded in July
     1994. 
       The $163 million decline in pre-tax earnings in the Corporate
     segment is primarily due to the previously discussed $157 million
     pre-tax loss from closing the option portion of two interest rate
     swaps. 
       1993 -- Worldwide, the Company had a $656 million after-tax loss due
     to two unusual items, the restructuring reserves and accounting
     changes described below: 
        -  A $1,746 million after-tax provision for restructuring was
           established including (1) $1,546 million in the fourth quarter
           to cover worldwide manufacturing consolidations and an overhead
           reduction initiative through organizational restructuring under
           the Strengthening Global Effectiveness (SGE) program; and (2)
           an after-tax reserve of $200 million in September 1992 for
           divestiture of the 100% juice business. 
        -  Two new mandatory accounting standards covering retiree health
           and life insurance benefits, and deferred taxes, SFAS No.106
           and No.109, respectively, were retroactively adopted effective
           July, 1992. The current and prior years' impacts on net
           earnings were $63 million and $925 million, respectively.
       Excluding the restructuring reserves and the prior years' effect of
     accounting changes, net earnings would have been $2,015 million. Also,
     excluding the $63 million current year effect of accounting changes,
     1993 net earnings would have been $2,078 million up 11% from the
     previous year. 
       Net sales exceeded $30 billion for the first time and were up 4%
     compared with the previous year. Worldwide unit volume grew 3% led by
     a 10% increase in the International businesses. United States unit
     volume excluding the divested juice and pulp business was up only 1%
     for the full year, but improved during each quarter of the year with
     volume up 6% in the April-June quarter. 
       Worldwide cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was
     58.1% which compared with 59.0% for the previous year. Marketing,
     administrative and other expenses as a percentage of net sales was
     31.5%, up from 31.2% in the previous year. 
       Operating Income excluding the restructuring provision was up 10%
     from the previous year, and the operating margin was 10.4% in 1993, up
     from 9.8% and 10.0% in the previous two years. 
       Interest expense increased $42 million. This included $79 million
     from preferred dividends no longer reducing interest expense for
     accounting purposes beginning in 1993, partially offset by $37 million
     lower interest expense primarily from lower borrowing rates. Other
     income/expense, net decreased $83 million, primarily due to a $103
     million gain on the sale of the Italian coffee business in the
     previous year. 
       The unusually low 22.9% effective tax rate in 1993 was due to the
     pre-tax restructuring reserve reducing before tax earnings to a
     relatively small amount which accentuated the percentage impact of
     certain cost elements not tax affected at the 34% U.S. statutory rate.
     Excluding the restructuring reserve, the 1993 effective tax rate would
     have been 34.0% which compares with 35.1% and 34.0% for the previous
     two years.

       In the following year-to-year comparisons of geographic and business
     segments, 1993 earnings have been adjusted upward to exclude the cost
     impact of the restructuring reserves and the current and prior years'
     effect of accounting changes to make the ongoing results for 1993 and
     1992 more comparable. 
       In the United States, after-tax earnings were $1,558 million, up 7%
     from the previous year. The net profit margin for the year was 10.1%,
     the highest level achieved over the past decade and up from 9.4% in
     1992. Notable margin improvements were realized by laundry and
     cleaning products and food and beverage products, primarily coffee and
     peanut butter. 
       International after-tax earnings were $681 million, up 9% over the
     previous year. International again established a unit volume record,
     with double-digit increases in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, European
     paper and citrus products, and the Middle East-Africa-General Export
     businesses. 
       Worldwide laundry and cleaning earnings were $1,389 million, up 9%
     versus the previous year. The profit margin was 13.8%, up slightly
     from 13.4% in the previous year. Segment sales grew 6% to $10 billion
     on an 8% increase in unit volumes, led by double digit gains in
     International. 
       Personal care earnings were virtually the same as the previous year.
     Lower domestic diaper earnings offset earnings growth elsewhere in the
     segment. Segment sales increased 7% to $16 billion in 1993.
     International sales were up 13% and broadly based. U.S. sales were up
     1% with lower diaper volumes slowing the growth in domestic sales.
       Food and beverage segment earnings were up 98% to $249 million
     versus $126 million in the previous year, excluding the one-time 1992
     gain from sale of the Italian coffee business. The profit margin more
     than doubled, increasing to 7.6% in 1993 due primarily to the
     divestiture of the 100% juice business. Sales were down $438 million,
     due to a 7% decline in shipment volume, primarily reflecting the
     divestiture of the 100% juice business. 
       Pulp and chemicals earnings were down $12 million to $62 million and
     sales were down 18% with the declines largely attributable to the
     divestiture of the pulp business in 1993. 
       During the year, the Company entered into agreements to dispose of
     most of its commercial pulp business. Although the pulp business has
     been profitable, Company strategy no longer recognizes an advantage to
     vertical integration of the pulp supply for its consumer paper brands.
     These assets have been sold to focus efforts on and to fund the growth
     of the Company's consumer businesses. The sales, which include pulp
     plants and timberlands, are expected to bring a total price of $1.2
     billion, including $.7 billion received in 1993. The impact on 1993
     earnings was not material, and the impact from the remaining sales is
     not expected to be material. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION
     JUNE 30, 1994
     The Company's balance sheet remains strong. Cash and cash equivalents
     totaled $2,373 million, an increase of $51 million from the previous
     year. Cash flow from operating activities reached a record $3,649
     million up $311 million over the previous year, despite the negative
     cash impact of executing the projects contained in the 1993
     restructuring reserves. Charges in 1994 to the restructuring reserve
     established in June 1993 totaled $600 million of which $360 million
     impacted cash primarily due to separation costs. Increased earnings
     and continuing reductions in working capital were key factors in
     offsetting these charges. 
       Total debt excluding exchange effects decreased $664 million from
     the previous year-end, reflecting reductions in both short term and
     long term debt. 
       Accrued environmental liabilities for on-site remediation and
     certain settlement costs at June 30, 1994 and 1993 amounted to $127
     million and $133 million respectively. At both year-

                                                                         35

     FINANCIAL CONDITION (continued)
     ends, the majority of these liabilities were anticipated exit costs
     accrued in the 1993 restructuring reserve and related to the closing
     of manufacturing facilities. In addition, the Company is involved in
     clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund locations, many of which are
     still in the preliminary stages of investigation. The related off-site
     liabilities for these efforts at June 30, 1994 and 1993 were $8
     million and $9 million respectively, with a high end of the range at
     June 30, 1994 of $12 million. Remediation and settlement expenses at
     all sites were not material during the past fiscal year. 
       Regarding investing activities, capital expenditures were
     approximately the same level for each of the past three years and were
     $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for 1994 and 1993 respectively. A
     similar level of capital expenditures is anticipated in the coming
     year. 
       Dividends of $1.24 per common share were paid during the past year,
     up from $1.10 and $1.025 per share in the previous two years. In July
     1994, the Company announced a 13% increase in the annual rate from
     $1.24 to $1.40 per common share, effective with the quarterly dividend
     paid in mid-August to shareholders of record on July 22, 1994. This
     marks the 39th consecutive fiscal year of increased common share
     dividend payments. 
       The effects of inflation have not been a significant factor on
     earnings growth in recent years. 
       In July 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of the European
     tissue business of Vereinigte Papierwerke Schickedanz AG which is
     primarily centered in Germany. This includes Tempo, the leading
     European paper handkerchief brand and Bess, the leading bath tissue
     brand in Germany. Also in July 1994, the Company announced the planned
     acquisition of the Giorgio Beverly Hills Inc. prestige fragrance
     business from Avon Products, Inc. This included the Giorgio, Red and
     Wings fragrances for men and women. Both of these acquisitions, with a
     purchase price totaling about $600 million, are being financed
     primarily from available cash funds. Also, in July 1994 the Company
     sold its timberland properties and thereby completed the divestiture
     of the commercial pulp business. As previously indicated, this
     divestiture did not have a material impact on earnings. 

     JUNE 30, 1993
     Cash and cash equivalents were $2,322 million, an increase of $546
     million over the previous year-end. In addition, marketable securities
     of $306 million were added to the short-term investment portfolio
     during the year and carried on the balance sheet as a current asset.
       Cash flow from operating activities amounted to $3,338 million, up
     $313 million from the previous year. Reductions in working capital
     accounted for $143 million of this increase, and included a $97
     million reduction in inventories. 
       The increase of $611 million in other assets on the balance sheet
     was due to increases in joint venture investments and increased
     receivables from asset sales. 
       In fiscal 1993, the Company established restructuring reserves of
     $2.7 billion, including $2.4 billion for manufacturing consolidations
     and other organizational restructuring. Of the latter amount, $1.2
     billion related to non-cash charges, primarily the carrying value of
     anticipated disposals of fixed assets from manufacturing plant
     closings. The remaining $1.2 billion is anticipated cash outlays,
     primarily employee separations and costs related to separation
     partially offset by cash anticipated from asset disposals. These
     outlays will continue over the next several years and are expected to
     be funded from cash generated from operations.

          POLICY YEAR.  Reasonable and necessary attorneys fees incurred in
          investigating and defending a CLAIM shall be part of and not in
          addition to the 

                                     1


<PAGE>

          LIMIT OF LIABILITY as stated in Item III of the Declarations, and
          payment by the INSURER of such attorneys fees shall reduce the
          LIMIT OF LIABILITY.

     (g)  "LOSS" shall mean any and all amounts that the INSUREDS are
          legally obligated to pay by reason of a CLAIM made against the
          INSUREDS for any WRONGFUL ACT, and shall include but not be
          limited to compensatory, exemplary, punitive and multiple
          damages, judgments, settlements and reasonable and necessary
          costs of investigation and defense of CLAIMS and appeals
          therefrom (including but not limited to attorneys fees but
          excluding all salaries and office expenses of the COMPANY,
          amounts paid to counsel as general retainer fees, and all other
          expenses that cannot be directly allocated to a specific (CLAIM)
          and cost of attachment or similar bonds, providing always,
          however, LOSS shall not include taxes, fines or penalties imposed
          by law, or matters that may be deemed uninsurable under the law
          pursuant to which this POLICY shall be construed.  ("Fines or
          penalties" do not include punitive, exemplary, or multiple
          damages).

     (h)  "POLICY" shall mean this insurance policy, including the
          APPLICATION, the Declarations, and any endorsements hereto issued
          by the INSURER.

     (i)  "POLICY PERIOD" shall mean the period of time stated in Item II
          of the Declarations, as may be automatically extended in
          accordance with Clause 7 (Automatic Extension) below.  If this
          POLICY is cancelled in accordance with subpart (c) or (d) of
          Clause 8 (Cancellation) below, the POLICY PERIOD shall end upon
          the effective date of such cancellation.

     (j)  "POLICY YEAR" shall mean a period of one year, within the POLICY
          PERIOD, commencing each year on the day and hour first named in
          Item II of the Declarations, or if the time between the inception
          date, or any anniversary date and the termination date of this
          POLICY is less than one year, then such lesser period.

     (k)  "SUBSIDIARY" shall mean any corporation in which more than 50% of
          the outstanding securities representing the present right to vote
          for election of directors is owned, directly or indirectly, in
          any combination, by the COMPANY and/or by one or more of its
          SUBSIDIARIES, at the starting date of the POLICY PERIOD.

     (l)  "WRONGFUL ACT" shall mean any actual or alleged error,
          misstatement, misleading statement or act, omission, neglect, or
          breach of duty by the INSUREDS while acting in their individual
          or collective capacities as directors or officers of the COMPANY,
          or any other matter claimed against them by reason of their being
          directors or officers of the COMPANY.

          All such errors, misstatements, misleading statements or acts,
          omissions, neglects, or breaches of duty actually or allegedly
          caused, committed, or attempted by or claimed against one or more
          of the INSUREDS arising out of or relating to the same or series
          of related facts, circumstances, situations, transactions or
          events shall be deemed to be a single WRONGFUL ACT.

3.   EXCLUSIONS

     The INSURER shall not be liable to make any payment for LOSS in
     connection with that portion of any CLAIM made against the INSUREDS:

     (a)  for which the COMPANY actually pays or indemnifies or is required
          or permitted to pay on behalf of or to indemnify the INSUREDS
          pursuant to the charter or other similar formative document or
          by-laws or written agreements of the COMPANY duly effective under
          applicable law, that determines and defines such rights of
          indemnity; provided, however, this exclusion shall not apply if:

          (1)  the COMPANY refuses to indemnify or advance defense or other
               costs as required or permitted, or if the COMPANY is
               financially unable to indemnify; and

          (2)  the INSUREDS comply with Clause 20 (Subrogation) below;


                                     2


<PAGE>

     (b)  based upon or attributable to the INSUREDS having gained any
          personal profit to which they were not legally entitled if a
          judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the insureds or
          any arbitration proceeding pursuant to Clause 5 (Arbitration)
          below establishes that the INSUREDS in fact gained any such
          personal profit;

     (c)  for the return by the INSUREDS of any improper or illegal
          remuneration paid in fact to the INSUREDS if it shall be
          determined by a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to
          the INSUREDS that such remuneration is improper or illegal or if
          such remuneration is to be repaid to the COMPANY under a
          settlement agreement;

     (d)  for an accounting of profits in fact made from the purchase or
          sale by the INSUREDS of securities of the COMPANY within the
          meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
          and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any state
          statutory law or common law;

     (e)  brought about or contributed to by the dishonesty of the INSUREDS
          if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the INSUREDS
          or any arbitration proceeding pursuant to Clause 5 (Arbitration)
          below establishes that acts of active and deliberate dishonesty
          committed by the INSUREDS with actual dishonest purpose and
          intent were material to the CLAIM;

     (f)  which is insured by any other existing valid policy or policies
          under which payment of the LOSS is actually made except in
          respect of any excess beyond the amounts of payments under such
          other policy or policies;

     (g)  for which the INSUREDS are indemnified by reason of having given
          notice of a CLAIM or of any circumstance which might give rise to
          a CLAIM under any policy or policies of which this POLICY is a
          renewal or replacement or which it may succeed in time;

     (h)  for personal injury, advertising injury, bodily injury, sickness,
          disease, or death of any person, or for damage to or destruction
          of any tangible property, including the loss of use thereof;
          however, this exclusion shall not apply to any derivative action
          brought against any INSURED;

     (i)  by, on behalf of, at the behest of, or in the right of the
          COMPANY, if initiated by the management of the COMPANY; however,
          this exclusion shall not apply if, between the starting date of
          the POLICY PERIOD and the date of the CLAIM, the COMPANY shall
          have undergone any of the events listed in subpart (a) or (b) of
          Clause 8 (Cancellation) below, and the CLAIM is initiated by the
          management of the COMPANY after the date of such event; or

     (j)  for any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
          statement or act, omission, neglect or breach of duty by the
          INSUREDS while acting in their capacities as directors, officers,
          trustees, governors, partners, employees or agents of any entity
          other than the COMPANY or by reason of their being directors,
          officers, trustees, governors, partners, employees or agents of
          such other entity.

It is agreed that any fact pertaining to any INSURED shall not be imputed
to any other INSURED for the purpose of determining the application of the
Exclusions.

4.   APPEALS

     In the event the INSUREDS elect not to appeal a judgment, the INSURER
     may elect to make such appeal at its own expense, and shall be liable
     for any increased award, taxable costs and disbursements and any
     additional interest incidental to such appeal, to the extent such
     payments are not covered by other valid and collectible insurance.
5.   ARBITRATION

     (a)  Any dispute arising in connection with this POLICY shall be fully
          determined in Bermuda under the provisions of the Bermuda
          Arbitration Act of 1986, as amended and supplemented, by a Board
          of Arbitration composed of three arbitrators who shall all be
          disinterested, active or retired 

                                     3


<PAGE>

          business executives having knowledge relevant to the matters in
          dispute, and who shall be selected for each controversy as
          follows:

          Either party to the dispute may, once a CLAIM or demand on his
          part has been denied or remains unsatisfied for a period of
          twenty (20) calendar days by the other party, notify the other of
          its desire to arbitrate the matter in dispute and at the time of
          such notification the party desiring arbitration shall notify the
          other party of the name of the arbitrator selected by it.  The
          other party who has been so notified shall within ten (10)
          calendar days thereafter select an arbitrator and notify the
          party desiring arbitration of the name of such second arbitrator. 
          If the party notified of a desire for arbitration shall fail or
          refuse to nominate the second arbitrator within ten (10) calendar
          days following the receipt of such notification, the party who
          first served notice of a desire to arbitrate will, within an
          additional period of ten (10) calendar days, apply to the Supreme
          Court of Bermuda for the appointment of a second arbitrator and
          in such a case the arbitrator appointed by such a judge shall be
          deemed to have been nominated by the party who failed to select
          the second arbitrator.  The two arbitrators, chosen as above
          provided, shall within ten (10) calendar days after the
          appointment of the second arbitrator choose a third arbitrator. 
          In the event of the failure of the first two arbitrators to agree
          on a third arbitrator within the said ten (10) calendar day
          period, either of the parties may within a period of ten (10)
          calendar days thereafter, after notice to the other party, apply
          to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for the appointment of a third
          arbitrator and in such case the person so appointed shall be
          deemed and shall act as a third arbitrator.  Upon acceptance of
          the appointment by said third arbitrator, the Board of
          Arbitration for the controversy in question shall be deemed
          fixed.

     (b)  The Board of Arbitration shall fix, by a notice in writing to the
          parties involved, a reasonable time and place for the hearing and
          may prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the
          course and conduct of the arbitration proceeding, including
          without limitation discovery by the parties.

     (c)  This POLICY shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
          accordance with the internal laws of Bermuda, except insofar as
          such laws may prohibit payment in respect of punitive damages
          hereunder; provided, however, that the provisions, stipulations,
          exclusions and conditions of this POLICY are to be construed in
          an evenhanded fashion as between the parties; without limitation,
          where the language of this POLICY is deemed to be ambiguous or
          otherwise unclear, the issue shall be resolved in the manner most
          consistent with the relevant provisions stipulations, exclusions
          and conditions (without regard to authorship of the language,
          without any presumption or arbitrary interpretation or
          construction in favor of either the INSUREDS or the INSURER) and
          in accordance with the intent of the parties.

     (d)  The Board of Arbitration shall, within ninety (90) calendar days
          following the conclusion of the hearing, render its decision on
          the matter or matters in controversy in writing and shall cause a
          copy thereof to be served on all the parties thereto.  In case
          the Board of Arbitration fails to reach a unanimous decision, the
          decision of the majority of the members of said Board shall be
          deemed to be the decision of the Board.

     (e)  Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator.  The
          remaining costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the
          parties to such arbitration.

     (f)  All decisions and awards by the Board of Arbitration shall be
          final and binding upon the parties.  The parties hereby agree to
          exclude any right of appeal under Section 29 of the Bermuda
          Arbitration Act of 1986 against any award rendered by the Board
          of Arbitration and further agree to exclude any application under
          Section 30(1) of the Bermuda Arbitration Act of 1986 for a
          determination of any question of law by the Supreme Court of
          Bermuda.

     (g)  All awards made by the Board of Arbitration may be enforced in
          the same manner as a judgment or order from the Supreme Court of
          Bermuda and judgment may be entered pursuant to the terms of the
          award by leave from the Supreme Court of Bermuda.

     (h)  The INSURER and the INSUREDS agree that in the event that claims
          for indemnity or 

                                     4


<PAGE>

          contribution are asserted in any action or proceeding against the
          INSURER by any of the INSUREDS' other insurers in any
          jurisdiction or forum other than that set forth in this Clause 5,
          the INSUREDS will in good faith take all reasonable steps
          requested by the INSURER to assist the INSURER in obtaining a
          dismissal of these claims (other than on the merits) and will,
          without limitation, undertake to the court or other tribunal to
          reduce any judgment or award against such other insurers to the
          extent that the court or tribunal determines that the INSURER
          would have been liable to such insurers for indemnity or
          contribution pursuant to this POLICY.  The INSUREDS shall be
          entitled to assert claims against the INSURER for coverage under
          this POLICY, including, without limitation, for amounts by which
          the INSUREDS reduced its judgment against such other insurers in
          respect of such claims for indemnity or contribution, in an
          arbitration between the INSURER and the INSUREDS pursuant to this
          Clause 5; provided, however, that the INSURER in such arbitration
          in respect of such reduction of any judgment shall be entitled to
          raise any defenses under this POLICY and any other defenses
          (other than jurisdictional defenses) as it would have been
          entitled to raise in the action or proceeding with such insurers.

6.   ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION    

     The INSURER has no duty to defend any CLAIM and shall not be called
     upon to assume charge of the investigation, settlement or defense of
     any CLAIM, but the INSURER shall have the right and shall be given the
     opportunity to associate with the INSUREDS and the COMPANY in the
     investigation, settlement, defense and control of any CLAIM relative
     to any WRONGFUL ACT where the CLAIM is or may be covered in whole or
     in part by this POLICY.  At all times, the INSUREDS and the COMPANY
     and the INSURER shall cooperate in the investigation, settlement and
     defense of such CLAIM.  The failure of the COMPANY to assist and
     cooperate with the INSURER shall not impair the rights of the INSUREDS
     under this POLICY.  The INSUREDS shall not settle or admit any
     liability with respect to any CLAIM which involves or appears
     reasonably likely to involve this POLICY without the INSURER'S
     consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

7.   AUTOMATIC EXTENSION

     Except in the event this POLICY is cancelled in whole or in part in
     accordance with Clause 8 (Cancellation) below, on each anniversary of
     this POLICY, upon submission of the extension application and payment
     of the charged premium, this POLICY shall automatically be continued
     to a date one year beyond its previously stated expiration date,
     unless written notice is given by the INSURER to the COMPANY, or by
     the COMPANY to the INSURER, that such POLICY extension is not desired. 
     Such written notice may be given at any time prior to the anniversary
     of the POLICY, except that such notice by the INSURER to the COMPANY
     may be given only during the period commencing ninety (90) days and
     ending ten (10) days prior to such anniversary, in which case the
     POLICY shall automatically expire two years from such anniversary
     date.  

     Such written notice shall be given by the INSURER to the COMPANY only
     if it is determined to be appropriate by an affirmative vote of 2/3 of
     the INSURER'S entire Executive Committee at a meeting of said
     Committee prior to mailing of such notice.  Any non-extension by the
     INSURER shall be revoked as of the next meeting of the INSURER'S Board
     of Directors if the Board at such meeting so determines by an
     affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board.  If any such non-
     extension is so revoked or if during the remainder of the POLICY
     PERIOD the INSURER agrees to extend coverage, this POLICY shall be
     continued or such agreed coverage may be extended, respectively, to
     the expiration date which would otherwise be applicable if such notice
     of non-extension had not been given, provided the COMPANY submits the
     extension application and pays the charged premium.

     If the COMPANY or the INSURER gives written notice that the POLICY
     extension is not desired, the COMPANY shall pay on or before each of
     the two remaining anniversary dates the charged premium for the next
     succeeding POLICY YEAR respectively less a premium credit equal to the
     premium paid at inception of the POLICY for Year 2 and Year 3 of the
     POLICY, respectively.  If any such premium credit exceeds the charged
     premium, the INSURER shall refund to the COMPANY the difference within
     ten days following such anniversary date.

                                     5


<PAGE>

     The premium charged on each anniversary of this POLICY shall be
     determined by the rating plan and by-laws of the INSURER in force at
     such anniversary date.


8.   CANCELLATION

     This POLICY shall not be subject to cancellation except as follows:

     (a)  In the event during the POLICY PERIOD:

          (1)  the company named in Item I of the Declarations shall merge
               into or consolidate with another organization in which the
               company named in Item I of the Declarations is not the
               surviving entity, or

          (2)  any person or entity or group of persons and/or entities
               acting in concert shall acquire securities or voting rights
               which results in ownership or voting control by such person
               or entity or group of persons or entities of more than 50%
               of the outstanding securities representing the present right
               to vote for election of directors of the company named in
               Item I of the Declarations,

          this POLICY shall not apply to any WRONGFUL ACTS actually or
          allegedly taking place after the effective date of said merger,
          consolidation or acquisition; however, this POLICY shall remain
          in force for the remainder of the POLICY PERIOD as to CLAIMS
          based upon WRONGFUL ACTS alleged to have been committed prior to
          such date.  All premiums paid or due at the time of said merger,
          consolidation or acquisition shall be fully earned and in no
          respect refundable.

     (b)  In the event of the appointment by any state or federal official,
          agency or court of any receiver, conservator, liquidator,
          trustee, rehabilitator or similar official to take control of,
          supervise, manage or liquidate any entity included within the
          definition of the COMPANY, or in the event such entity becomes a
          debtor in possession, this POLICY shall not apply to any WRONGFUL
          ACTS by the directors and officers of such entity actually or
          allegedly taking place after the date of such event.  This POLICY
          shall remain in force for the remainder of the POLICY PERIOD from
          said date as to CLAIMS for (i) WRONGFUL ACTS by any other
          INSUREDS, and (ii) WRONGFUL ACTS by the directors and officers of
          such entity alleged to have been committed prior to the date of
          such event.  All premiums paid or due at the time of such event
          shall be fully earned, and in no respect refundable.  With
          respect to CLAIMS first made after the date of such event for
          WRONGFUL ACTS by the directors and officers of such entity, (i)
          the LIMIT OF LIABILITY of this POLICY for the remainder of the
          POLICY PERIOD shall be a continuation of the same limit, and not
          a separate limit, as was in effect during the POLICY YEAR in
          which such event occurred; and (ii) such CLAIMS shall be deemed
          to have been first made during the POLICY YEAR in which such
          event occurred for purposes of the LIMIT OF LIABILITY.

     (c)  This POLICY may be cancelled by mutual agreement and consent of
          the INSURER, the COMPANY, and the INSUREDS, upon such terms and
          conditions as respects return premium and/or future premium
          adjustments and/or loss adjustments as the parties may agree upon
          at the time of said cancellation.

     (d)  This POLICY may be cancelled by the INSURER upon granting of 365
          days written notice, providing such cancellation is determined to
          be appropriate by an affirmative vote of 3/4 of the INSURER'S
          entire Board at a meeting of said Board prior to mailing of said
          notice.  Payment or tender of any unearned premium by the INSURER
          shall not be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of
          cancellation, but return of the pro rata unearned premium shall
          be made as soon as practicable.

     (e)  In the event the charged premium for any POLICY YEAR is not paid
          as provided in Clause 7 (Automatic Extension), above, this POLICY
          shall not apply to any WRONGFUL ACTS actually or allegedly taking
          place after the anniversary date on which the additional premium
          was due; however, this POLICY shall remain in force for the
          remainder of the POLICY PERIOD as to CLAIMS first made during the
          POLICY PERIOD for WRONGFUL ACTS actually or allegedly

                                     6


<PAGE>

          caused, committed or attempted prior to such anniversary date. 
          With respect to all CLAIMS first made after such anniversary
          date, one LIMIT OF LIABILITY shall apply for the remainder of the
          POLICY PERIOD.  Such LIMIT OF LIABILITY shall be separate from
          the LIMIT OF LIABILITY provided during the POLICY YEAR
          immediately preceding such anniversary date.  All premiums paid
          as of such anniversary date shall be fully earned and in no
          respect refundable.

9.   CHANGES AND ASSIGNMENTS

     The terms and conditions of this POLICY shall not be waived or
     changed, nor shall an assignment of interest under this POLICY be
     binding, except by an endorsement to this POLICY issued by the
     INSURER.

10.  PAYMENT OF LOSS

     Except in those instances when the INSURER has denied liability for
     the CLAIM because of the application of one or more exclusions, or
     other coverage issues, if the COMPANY refuses or is financially unable
     to advance LOSS costs, the INSURER shall, upon request and if proper
     documentation accompanies the request, advance on behalf of the

          APPLICATION for coverage by each INSURED.  With respect to the
          declarations and statements contained in such APPLICATION for
          coverage, no statement in the APPLICATION or knowledge possessed

     subrogated to the extent of such payment to all the INSUREDS' rights
     of recovery, and the INSUREDS shall execute all papers reasonably
     required and shall take all reasonable actions that may be necessary
     to secure such rights including the execution of such documents
     necessary to enable the INSURER effectively to bring suit in the name
     of the INSUREDS, including but not limited to an action against the
     COMPANY for nonpayment of indemnity due and owing to the INSUREDS by

          assets of the COMPANY or $250,000,000, whichever is less.  The

          or allegedly taking place subsequent to the date of acquisition
          or creation of the subsidiary.

     (b)  Coverage shall not apply to directors and officers of any
          subsidiary, including a SUBSIDIARY as defined in Clause 2
          (Definitions) above, for CLAIMS for WRONGFUL ACTS actually or
          allegedly taking place subsequent to the date that the COMPANY
          and/or one or more of its SUBSIDIARIES, directly or indirectly,
          in any combination, ceases to own more than 50% of the
          outstanding securities representing the present right to vote for
          election of directors in such subsidiary.

POLICY is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

     Except in the event this POLICY is canceled in whole or in part
     in accordance with Clause 8 (Cancellation) below, on each
     anniversary of this POLICY, upon submission of the extension
     application and payment of the charged premium, this POLICY shall
     automatically be continued to a date one year beyond its
     previously stated expiration date, unless written notice is given
     by the INSURER to the COMPANY, or by the COMPANY to the INSURER,
     that such POLICY extension is not desired.  Such written notice
     may be given at any time prior to the anniversary of the POLICY,
     except that such notice by the INSURER to the COMPANY may be
     given only during the period commencing ninety (90) days and
     ending ten (10) days prior to such anniversary, in which case the
     POLICY shall automatically expire two years from such anniversary
     date.  Such written notice shall be given by the INSURER to the
     COMPANY only if it is determined to be appropriate by an
     affirmative vote of a majority of the INSURER's entire Board at a
     meeting of said Board prior to mailing of such notice.

     The premium charged on each anniversary of this POLICY shall be

     only if it is determined to be appropriate by an affirmative vote
     of 2/3 of the INSURER'S entire Executive Committee at a meeting
     of said Committee prior to mailing of such notice.  Any non-
     extension by the INSURER shall be revoked as of the next meeting
     of the INSURER'S Board of Directors if the Board at such meeting
     so determines by an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire
     Board.  If any such non-extension is so revoked or if during the

     coverage, this POLICY shall be continued or such agreed coverage
     may be extended, respectively, to the expiration date which would
     otherwise be applicable if such notice of Non-extension had not
     been given, provided the COMPANY submits the extension
     application and pays the charged premium.

     POLICY extension is not desired, the COMPANY shall pay on or
     before each of the two remaining anniversary dates the charged
     premium for the next succeeding POLICY YEAR respectively less a
     premium credit equal to the premium paid for the two respective
     POLICY YEARS remaining in the POLICY PERIOD as of the effective
     date of this Endorsement.  If any such premium credit exceeds the
     charged premium, the INSURER shall refund to the COMPANY the
     difference within ten days following such anniversary date.

by the rating plan and by-laws of the INSURER in force at such anniversary
date.

                DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE

Named Company: As stated in Item 1 of the Declarations forming a part hereof
               (hereinafter called the "Named Company").


                            INSURING AGREEMENTS

I.   COVERAGE

     The X.L. Insurance Company, Ltd. (the "Company") hereby agrees with the
     Directors and Officers of the Named Company and any other companies
     listed in Schedule A hereto ("Designated Companies"), subject to the
     limitations, terms, exclusions and conditions hereinafter mentioned
     that, if during the policy period any claim or claims are made against
     any of the Directors and Officers for a Wrongful Act, and reported to
     the Company, the Company in accordance with its limits of liability
     shall pay on behalf of such Directors and Officers all loss which such
     Directors and Officers shall become legally obligated to pay, except for
     such loss which the Designated Companies shall indemnify such Directors
     and Officers.

II.  LIMIT OF LIABILITY

     A.   It is expressly agreed that liability for any loss shall attach to
          the Company only after the Primary and Underlying Excess Insurers
          shall have paid, admitted or been held liable to pay the full
          amount of their respective liability and the Directors and Officers
          shall have paid the full amount of self-insured retentions, if any,
          as set forth in Item 4 of the Declarations (hereinafter referred to
          as the "Schedule of Underlying Insurance"), and the Company shall
          then be liable to pay only additional amounts for any and all
          losses up to its Aggregate Limit of Liability ("aggregate limit")
          as set forth in Item 2 of the Declarations, which shall be the
          maximum liability of the Company for all covered losses (with
          respect to Directors and Officers, collectively) during the policy
          period irrespective of the time of payment by the Company.

     B.   In the event and only in the event of the reduction or exhaustion
          of the aggregate limits of liability under the said Primary and
          Underlying Excess Policies and under self-insured retentions, if
          any (as if such retentions were subject to the same terms,
          conditions, exclusions and structure of limits of liability as said
          policies) by reason of losses paid thereunder, this coverage shall:
          (i) in the event of reduction, pay the excess of the reduced
          Primary and Underlying Excess Limits, and (ii) in the event of
          exhaustion, continue in force as Primary Insurance; provided always
          that in the latter event this coverage shall only pay excess of the
          retention applicable to such Primary Insurance for such policy year
          as set forth in Item 4 (iii) of the Declarations, which shall be
          applied to any subsequent loss in the same manner as specified in
          such Primary Insurance.  Except insofar as aggregate limits of
          liability under the Primary and Underlying Excess Policies have
          been reduced or exhausted by reason of losses paid thereunder and
          self-insured retentions, if any, have been fully paid (as if such
          retentions were subject to the same terms, conditions, exclusions
          and structure of limits of liability as said policies), this
          coverage shall apply only as if all Primary and Underlying Policies
          and self-insured retentions, if any, listed on the Schedule of
          Underlying Insurance covered and were fully collectable for any
          loss hereunder.

III. PRIMARY AND UNDERLYING INSURANCE

     This Policy is subject to the same warranties, terms, conditions and
     exclusions (except as regards the premium, the amount and limits of
     liability, the policy period and except as otherwise provided herein) as
     are contained in or as may be added to the policy set forth in item 5 of
     the Declarations or, if no policy is set forth therein, the policy of
     the Primary Insurer(s) as respects coverage of the Directors and
     Officers.

     It is a condition of this Policy that the policies of the Primary and
     Underlying Excess Insurers shall be maintained in full effect during the
     policy year(s) listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance except for
     any reduction of the aggregate limits contained therein by reason of
     losses paid thereunder (as 

D&O-003B                             3

<PAGE>

                                               THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

     provided for in Paragraph II(B) above).  This Policy shall automatically
     terminate upon the failure to satisfy this condition (i.e., when any of
     such listed policies ceases to be in full effect) unless otherwise
     agreed by the Company in writing.  If the Named Company notifies the
     Company in writing of cancellation of any of the policies listed on the
     Schedule of Underlying Insurance at least thirty (30) days prior to the
     effectiveness thereof, the Company agrees that within twenty (20) days
     thereafter it will review the situation and formulate a proposal for the
     terms, conditions, exclusions, underlying amount, limit and premium for
     continuation of this Policy upon such cancellation; provided, however,
     that (i) the underlying amount shall be at least $20,000,000, (ii) the
     limit shall be a maximum of $25,000,000 and (iii) this Policy shall not
     continue after such cancellation unless there is an agreement in writing
     between the Named Company and the Company providing therefor.

IV.  COSTS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES   

     No costs, charges or expenses shall be incurred or settlements made
     without the Company's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
     withheld; however, in the event of such consent being given, the Company
     will pay, subject to the provisions of Article II, such costs,
     settlements, charges or expenses.

V.   NOTIFICATION   

     A.   If during the policy period or extended discovery period any claim
          is made against any Director or Officer, the Directors and Officers
          shall, as a condition precedent to their right to be indemnified
          under this Policy, give to the Company notice in writing as soon as
          practicable of such claims.

     B.   If during the policy period or extended discovery period:

          (1)  the Directors and Officers shall receive written or oral
               notice from any party that it is the intention of any such
               party to hold the Directors and Officers, or any of them,
               responsible for a Wrongful Act; or

          (2)  the Directors and Officers shall become aware of any fact,
               circumstance or situation which may subsequently give rise to
               a claim being made against the Directors and Officers, or any
               of them, for a Wrongful Act;

          and shall in either case during such period give written notice as
          soon as practicable to the Company of the receipt of such written
          or oral notice under Clause (1) or of such fact, circumstance or
          situation under Clause (2), then any claim, which may subsequently
          be made against the Directors and Officers, arising out of such
          Wrongful Act shall for the purpose of this Policy be treated as a
          claim made during the policy period.

     C.   Notice to the Company shall be given to the person or firm shown
          under Item 7 of the Declarations.  Notice shall be deemed to be
          received if sent by prepaid mail properly addressed.

VI.  GENERAL CONDITIONS

     A.   DEFINITIONS:  The terms "Directors and Officers", "Wrongful Act",
          "Loss", "Subsidiary", and "Policy Year" shall be deemed to have the
          same meanings in this Policy as are attributed to them in the
          policy set forth in Item 5 of the Declarations or, if no policy is
          set forth therein, the policy of the Primary Insurer(s).  The term
          "Company" shall mean the X.L. Insurance Company, Ltd.  The term
          "policy period" shall mean the period stated in Item 3 of the
          Declarations.

     B.   DISCOVERY CLAUSE:  If the Company shall cancel or refuse to renew
          this Policy, the Named Company or the Directors and Officers shall
          have the right, upon payment of the additional premium set forth in
          Item 8(a) of the Declarations to a continuation of the coverage
          granted by this Policy in respect of any claim or claims which may
          be made against the Directors and Officers during the period stated
          in Item 8(b) of the Declarations after the date of cancellation or
          non-renewal, but only in respect of any Wrongful Act committed
          before the date of cancellation or non-renewal of this Policy. 
          This right of extension shall terminate unless written notice is
          given to the Company within ten (10) days after the effective date
          of cancellation or non-renewal.

     C.   APPLICATION OF RECOVERIES:  All recoveries of payments recovered or
          received subsequent to a loss settlement under this Policy shall be
          applied as if recovered or received prior to such settlement and
          all necessary adjustments shall then be made between the Named
          Company or the Directors and Officers and the Company, provided
          always that nothing in this Policy shall be construed to mean that
          losses under this Policy are not payable until the Directors' and
          Officers' ultimate net loss has been finally ascertained.

     D.   CANCELLATION CLAUSE:  This coverage may be cancelled by the Named
          Company at any time by written notice or surrender of this Policy. 
          This coverage may also be cancelled by, or on behalf of, the
          Company by delivering to the Named Company or by mailing to the
          Named Company by registered, certified or other first class mail,
          at the Named Company's address shown in Item 1 of the Declarations,
          written notice stating when, not less than the number of days set
          forth in Item 9 of the Declarations, the cancellation shall become
          effective.  The mailing of such notice as aforesaid shall be
          sufficient proof of notice, and this Policy shall terminate at the
          date and hour specified in such notice.  If this Policy shall be
          cancelled by the Named Company, the Company shall retain the
          customary short rate proportion of premium hereon.  If this Policy
          shall be cancelled by or on behalf of the Company, the Company
          shall retain the pro rata proportion of the premium hereon. 
          Payment or tender of any unearned premium by the Company shall not
          be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of cancellation, but
          such payment shall be made as soon as practicable.

     E.   COOPERATION:  The Named Company, the Designated Companies and the
          Directors and Officers shall give the Company such information and
          cooperation as it may reasonably require.

     F.   PREMIUM:  The premium under this Policy is a flat premium and is
          not subject to adjustment except as otherwise provided herein.  The
          premium shall be paid to the Company.

     G.   WRONGFUL ACT EXCLUSION:  Notwithstanding any other provision of
          this Policy, this Policy shall not apply with respect to a Wrongful
          Act by any Director or Officer of the Company in his capacity as
          such.

     H.   NUCLEAR EXCLUSION:  This Policy shall not apply to, and the Company

          (3)  injury, sickness, disease, death or destruction resulting from
               hazardous properties of nuclear material, if (A) the nuclear
               material (i) is at any nuclear facility owned by or operated

     K.   OTHER CONDITIONS:  This Policy is subject to the following

          (1)  REPRESENTATION

               Except as respects the giving of notice to exercise extended
               discovery under Paragraph VI(B), the Named Company or such
               other person as it shall designate in Item 6 of the

          (3)  ASSIGNMENT

               Assignment of interest under this Policy shall not bind the
               Company unless and until consent is endorsed hereon.

          (4)  ARBITRATION

               Any dispute arising under this Policy shall be finally and
               fully determined in London, England under the provisions of
               the English Arbitration Act of 1950, as amended and
               supplemented, by a Board composed of three arbitrators to be
               selected for each controversy as follows:

               Any party to the dispute may, once a claim or demand on his
               part has been denied or remains unsatisfied for a period of
               twenty (20) calendar days by any other, notify the others of
               its desire to arbitrate the matter in dispute and at the time
               of such notification the party desiring arbitration shall
               notify any other party or parties of the name of the
               arbitrator selected by it.  Any party or parties who have been
               so notified shall within ten (10) calendar days thereafter
               select an arbitrator and notify the party desiring arbitration
               of the name of such second arbitrator.  If the party or
               parties notified of a desire for arbitration shall fail or
               refuse to nominate the second arbitrator within ten (10)
               calendar days following the receipt of such notification, the
               party who

<PAGE>

                                               THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

               first served notice of a desire to arbitrate will, within an
               additional period of ten (10) calendar days, apply to a judge
               of the High Court of England for the appointment of a second
               arbitrator and in such a case the arbitrator appointed by such
               a judge shall be deemed to have been nominated by the party or
               parties who failed to select the second arbitrator.  The two
               arbitrators, chosen as above provided, shall within ten (10)
               calendar days after the appointment of the second arbitrator
               choose a third arbitrator.  In the event of the failure of the
               first two arbitrators to agree on a third arbitrator within
               said ten (10) calendar day period, any of the parties may
               within a period of ten (10) calendar days thereafter, after
               notice to the other party or parties, apply to a judge of the
               High Court of England for the appointment of a third
               arbitrator and in such case the person so appointed shall be
               deemed and shall act as the third arbitrator. Upon acceptance
               of the appointment by said third arbitrator, the Board of
               Arbitration for the controversy in question shall be deemed
               fixed.  All claims, demands, denials of claims and notices
               pursuant to this Section (K)(iv) shall be deemed made if in
               writing and mailed to the last known address of the other
               party or parties.

               The Board of Arbitration shall fix, by a notice in writing to
               the parties involved, a reasonable time and place for the
               hearing and may in said written notice or at the time of the
               commencement of said hearing, at the option of said Board,
               prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the
               course and conduct of said hearing.

               The Board shall, within ninety (90) calendar days following
               the conclusion of the hearing, render its decision on the
               matter or matters in controversy in writing and shall cause a
               coy thereof to be served on all the parties thereto.  In case
               the Board fails to reach a unanimous decision, the decision of
               the majority of the members of the Board shall be deemed to be
               the decision of the Board and the same shall be final and
               binding on the parties thereto, and such decision shall be a
               complete defense to any attempted appeal or litigation of such
               decision in the absence of fraud or collusion.

               All costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties
               to such arbitration.

               The Company and the Insured agree that in the event that
               claims for indemnity or contribution are asserted in any
               action or proceeding against the Company by any of the
               Insured's other insurers in any jurisdiction or forum other
               than that set forth in this Section (K)(iv), the Insured will
               in good faith take all reasonable steps requested by the
               Company to assist the Company in obtaining a dismissal of
               these claims (other than on the merits) and will, without
               limitation, undertake to the court or other tribunal to reduce
               any judgment or award against such other insurers to the
               extent that the court or tribunal determines that the Company
               would have been liable to such insurers for indemnity or
               contribution pursuant to this Policy.  The Insured shall be
               entitled to assert claims against the Company for coverage
               under this Policy, including, without limitation, for amounts
               by which the Insured reduced its judgment against such other
               insurers in respect of such claims for indemnity or
               contribution in an arbitration between the Company and the
               Insured pursuant to this Section (K)(iv); provided, however,
               that the Company in such arbitration in respect of such
               reduction of any judgment shall be entitled to raise any
               defenses under this Policy and any other defenses (other than
               jurisdictional defenses) as it would have been entitled to
               raise in the action or proceeding with such insurers.

          (5)  GOVERNING LAW AND INTERPRETATION

               This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance
               with the internal laws of the State of New York, except
               insofar as such laws may prohibit payment in respect of
               punitive damages hereunder; provided, however, that the
               provisions, stipulations, exclusions and conditions of this
               Policy are to be construed in an evenhanded fashion as between
               the Insured and the Company; without limitation, where the
               language of this Policy is deemed to be ambiguous or otherwise
               unclear, the issue shall be resolved in the manner most
               consistent with the relevant provisions, stipulations,
               exclusions and conditions (without regard to authorship of the
               language, without any presumption or arbitrary interpretation
               or construction in favor of either the Insured or the Company
               and without reference to parol evidence).

THESE DECLARATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPLETED AND SIGNED APPLICATION AND
THE POLICY FORM ATTACHED HERETO, CONSTITUTE THE INSURANCE POLICY.

D & O 12-88 (B)                      2

I.   INSURING CLAUSE

     In consideration of the payment of the premium and in reliance upon all
statements made in the application form including the information furnished
in connection therewith, and subject to all terms, conditions, exclusions and
limitations of this policy, the Insurer agrees to provide insurance coverage
to the Insured Persons and, if applicable, the Insured Company in accordance
with the terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations of the Followed
Policy.

II.  LIMIT OF LIABILITY

     A.   It is expressly agreed that liability for any covered Loss with
          respect to claims first made in each Policy Year shall attach to
          the Insurer only after the insurers of the Underlying Policies, the
          Insured Company and/or the Insured Persons shall have paid,
          admitted or been held liable to pay the full amount of the
          Underlying Limit for such Policy Year.  The Insurer shall then be
          liable to pay only covered Loss in excess of such Underlying Limit
          up to its Aggregate Limit of Liability as set forth in Item 5 of
          the Declarations, which shall be the maximum aggregate liability of
          the Insurer under this policy with respect to all claims first made
          in each Policy Year against all Insured Persons irrespective of the
          time of payment by the Insurer.

     B.   Multiple claims based upon or arising out of the same, repeated,
          interrelated or causally connected Wrongful Acts, whether made
          against the same or different Insured Persons, shall be deemed to
          be a single claim first made in the earliest Policy Year in which
          the first of such multiple claims is made against any Insured
          Person; the Aggregate Limit of Liability shall apply only once to
          such multiple claims.

     C.   In the event and only in the event of the reduction or exhaustion
          of the Underlying Limit by reason of the insurers of the Underlying
          Policies, the Insured Company and/or the Insured Persons paying,
          admitting or being held liable to pay Loss otherwise covered
          hereunder, this policy shall: (i) in the event of reduction, pay
          excess of the reduced Underlying Limit, and (ii) in the event of
          exhaustion, continue in force as primary insurance; provided always
          that in the latter event this policy shall only pay excess of the
          retention applicable to the primary insurance as set forth in Item
          2 of the Declarations, which retention shall be applied to any
          subsequent Loss in the same manner as specified in such primary
          insurance.

     D.   Notwithstanding any of the terms of this policy which might be
          construed otherwise, this policy shall drop down only in the event
          of reduction or exhaustion of the Underlying Limit and shall not
          drop down for any other reason including, but not limited to,
          uncollectability (in whole or in part) of any underlying insurance. 
          The risk of uncollectability of such underlying insurance (in whole
          or in part) whether because of financial impairment or insolvency
          of an underlying insurer or for any other reason, is expressly
          retained by the Insured Persons and the Insured Company and is not
          in any way or under any circumstances insured or assumed by the
          Insurer.


III. UNDERLYING INSURANCE

     A.   This policy is subject to the same warranties, terms, conditions,
          exclusions and limitations (except as regards the premium, the
          amount and limits of liability, the policy period and except as
          otherwise provided herein) as are contained in or as may be added
          to the Followed Policy.

     B.   It is a condition of this policy that the Underlying Policies shall
          be maintained in full effect with solvent insurers during the
          policy period listed in Item 2 of the Declarations except for any
          reduction or exhaustion of the aggregate limits contained therein
          by reason of Loss paid thereunder (as provided for in Section II(C)
          above).  Unless the Insurer otherwise agrees in writing, this
          policy shall: (i) immediately and automatically terminate on the
          date any of the Underlying Policies ceases to be in full effect;
          and (ii) automatically terminate 30 days following the date an
          insurer of any Underlying Policy becomes subject to a receivership,
          liquidation, dissolution, rehabilitation or any similar proceeding
          or is taken over by any regulatory authority unless the Insured
          Company obtains replacement coverage for such Underlying Policy
          within such 30 day period.  In the event this policy automatically
          terminates pursuant to this Section III(B), the Insurer shall
          retain the pro-rata proportion of the premium.  Payment or tender
          of any unearned premium by the Insurer shall not be a condition
          precedent to the effectiveness of such termination, but such
          payment shall be made as soon as practicable.

D & O 12-88 (B)                      3

<PAGE>

     C.   If during the Policy Period or any discovery period the terms,
          conditions, exclusions or limitations of the Followed Policy are
          changed in any manner, the Insured Company or the Insured Persons
          shall as a condition precedent to their rights under this policy
          give to the Insurer as soon as practicable written notice of the
          full particulars thereof.  This policy shall become subject to any
          such changes upon the effective date of the changes in the Followed
          Policy, provided that the Insured Company shall pay any additional
          premium reasonably required by the Insurer for such changes.

IV.  GENERAL CONDITIONS

     A.   Discovery Period:  If the Insurer or the Insured Company fails or
          refuses to renew or cancels this policy, or if this policy
          automatically terminates pursuant to Section III(B), the Insured
          Company or the Insured Persons shall have the right, upon payment
          of an additional premium as set forth in Item 6 of the
          Declarations, to elect an extension of the coverage granted by this
          policy, but only for any Wrongful Act committed, attempted or
          allegedly committed or attempted prior to the effective date of
          such nonrenewal, cancellation or termination.  Any such election
          shall be made in writing in the time and manner and for the
          discovery period stated in the Followed Policy.

     B.   Application of Recoveries:  All recoveries or payments recovered or
          received subsequent to a Loss settlement under this policy shall be
          applied as if recovered or received prior to such settlement and
          all necessary adjustments shall then be made between the Insured
          Company or the Insured Person and the Insurer, provided always that
          the foregoing shall not affect the time when Loss under this policy
          shall be payable.

     C.   Notice:  All notices to the Insurer under any provisions of this
          policy shall be given by prepaid courier or electronic service
          properly addressed to the Insurer at its address as shown in the
          Declarations.  Notice so given shall be deemed to be received by
          the Insurer on the next succeeding day.

     D.   Cooperation:  The Insured Company and the Insured Persons shall
          give the Insurer such information and cooperation as it may
          reasonably require.

     E.   Premium:  The premium under this policy is a flat premium and is
          not subject to adjustment except as otherwise provided herein.  The
          premium shall be paid to the Insurer at its address as shown in the
          Declarations.

     F.   Cancellation Clause:  This policy may be cancelled by the Insured
          Company at any time by written notice or surrender of this policy
          to the Insurer.  This policy may also be cancelled by, or on behalf
          of, the Insurer by delivering to the Insured Company or by mailing
          to the Insured Company by registered, certified or other first
          class mail, at the address shown in the Declarations, written
          notice stating when, not less than (365) days thereafter, the
          cancellation shall become effective.  The mailing of such notice as
          aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice, and this policy
          shall terminate at the date and hour specified in such notice.  If
          this policy shall be cancelled by the Insured Company, the Insurer
          shall retain the customary short rate proportion of premium hereon. 
          If this policy shall be cancelled by or on behalf of the Insurer,
          the Insurer shall retain the pro-rata proportion of the premium
          hereon.  Payment or tender of any unearned premium by the Insurer
          shall not be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of
          cancellation, but such payment shall be made as soon as
          practicable.

     G.   Capacity:  Notwithstanding any other provision of this policy,
          coverage hereunder shall not apply with respect to a Wrongful Act
          by any Insured Person in his capacity as director or officer of the
          Insurer.

     H.   Changes:  Notice to or knowledge possessed by any person shall not
          effect waiver or change in any part of this policy or estop the
          Insurer from asserting any right under the terms of this policy;
          nor shall the terms of this policy be waived or changed, except by
          endorsement issued to form a part hereof, signed by the Insurer or
          its authorized representative.

     I.   Arbitration:  Any dispute arising under or relating to this policy,
          or the breach thereof, shall be finally and fully determined in
          Hamilton, Bermuda under the provisions of the Bermuda Arbitration
          Act of 1986, as amended and supplemented, by an Arbitration Board
          composed of three arbitrators who shall be disinterested and active
          or retired business executives having knowledge relevant to the
          matters in dispute, and who shall be selected for each controversy
          as follows:

          Either party to the dispute, once a claim or demand on its part has
          been denied or remains unsatisfied for a period of twenty (20)
          calendar days by the other party, may notify the other party of its
          desire to arbitrate the matter in dispute and at the time of such
          notification the party desiring arbitration shall notify the other
          party of the name of the arbitrator selected by it.  The other
          party who has been so 

D & O 12-88 (B)                      4

<PAGE>

          notified shall within ten (10) calendar days thereafter select an
          arbitrator and notify the party desiring arbitration of the name of
          such second arbitrator.  If the party notified of a desire for
          arbitration shall fail or refuse to nominate the second arbitrator
          within ten (10) calendar days following the receipt of such
          notification, the party who first served notice of a desire to
          arbitrate will, within an additional period of ten (10) calendar
          days, apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for the appointment of
          a second arbitrator and in such a case the arbitrator appointed by
          the Supreme Court of Bermuda shall be deemed to have been nominated
          by the party who failed to select the second arbitrator.  The two
          arbitrators, chosen as above provided, shall within ten (10)
          calendar days after the appointment of the second arbitrator choose
          a third arbitrator.  In the event of the failure of the first two
          arbitrators to agree on a third arbitrator within the said ten (10)
          calendar day period, either party may within a period of ten (10)
          calendar days thereafter, after notice to the other party, apply to
          the Supreme Court of Bermuda for the appointment of a third
          arbitrator and in such case the person so appointed shall be deemed
          and shall act as the third arbitrator.  Upon acceptance of the
          appointment by said third arbitrator, the Arbitration Board for the
          controversy in question shall be deemed fixed.

          The Arbitration Board shall fix, by a notice in writing to the
          parties involved, a reasonable time and place for the hearing and
          may in said written notice or at the time of the commencement of
          said hearing, at the option of said Arbitration Board, prescribe
          reasonable rules and regulations governing the course and conduct
          of said hearing.

          The Board, shall, within ninety (90) calendar days following the
          conclusion of the hearing, render its decision on the matter or
          matters in controversy in writing and shall cause a copy thereof to
          be served on all parties thereto.  In case the Board fails to reach
          a unanimous decision, the decision of the majority of the members
          of the Board shall be deemed to be the decision of the Board.

          Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator.  The
          remaining cost of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the
          parties to such arbitration.

          All awards made by the Arbitration Board shall be final and no
          right of appeal shall lie from any award rendered by the
          Arbitration Board.  The parties agree that the Supreme Court of
          Bermuda: (i) shall not grant leave to appeal any award based upon
          a question of law arising out of the award; (ii) shall not grant
          leave to make an application with respect to an award; and (iii)
          shall not assume jurisdiction upon any application by a party to
          determine any issue of law arising in the course of the arbitration
          proceeding, including but not limited to whether a party has been
          guilty of fraud.

          All awards made by the Arbitration Board may be enforced in the
          same manner as a judgment or order from the Supreme Court of
          Bermuda and judgment may be entered pursuant to the terms of the
          award by leave from the Supreme Court of Bermuda.

          The Insurer and the Insureds agree that in the event that claims
          for indemnity or contribution are asserted in any action or
          proceeding against the Insurer by any of the Insureds' other
          insurers in any jurisdiction or forum other than that set forth in
          this clause, the Insureds will in good faith take all reasonable
          steps requested by the Insurer to assist the Insurer in obtaining
          a dismissal of these claims (other than on the merits) and will,
          without limitation, undertake to the court or other tribunal to
          reduce any judgment or award against such other insurers to the
          extent that the court or tribunal determines that the Insurer would
          have been liable to such insurers for indemnity or contribution
          pursuant to this policy.  The Insureds shall be entitled to assert
          claims against the Insurer for coverage under this policy,
          including, without limitation, for amounts by which the Insureds
          reduced its judgment against such other insurers in respect of such
          claims for indemnity or contribution, in an arbitration between the
          Insurer and the Insureds pursuant to this clause; provided,
          however, that the Insurer in such arbitration in respect of such
          reduction of any judgment shall be entitled to raise any defenses
          under this policy and any other defenses (other than jurisdictional
          defenses) as it would have been entitled to raise in the action or
          proceeding with such insurers.

     J.   Governing Law and Interpretation:  This policy shall be construed
          and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
          New York (with the exception of Section IV(i), which shall be
          construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Bermuda),
          except insofar as such laws may prohibit payment hereunder in
          respect of punitive damages; provided, however, that the terms,
          conditions, exclusions and limitations of this policy are to be
          construed in an evenhanded fashion as between the Insureds and the
          Insurer.  Without limitation, where the language of this policy is
          deemed to be ambiguous or otherwise unclear, the issues shall be
          resolved in the manner most consistent with the relevant terms,
          conditions, exclusions and limitations (without regard to
          authorship of the 

D & O 12-88 (B)                      5

<PAGE>

          language, without any presumption or arbitrary interpretation or
          construction in favour of either the Insureds or the Insurer and
          without reference to parol evidence).

     K.   Liability of the Company:  The Insured Company, the Insured Persons
          and the Insurer agree that the liability and obligations of the
          Insurer hereunder shall be satisfied from the funds of the Insurer
          alone and that the individual shareholders of the Insurer shall
          have no liability hereunder to the Insured Company or the Insured
          Persons.

     L.   Headings:  The descriptions in the headings and sub-headings of
          this policy are inserted solely for convenience and do not
          constitute any part of the terms or conditions hereof.

     M.   Currency:  The premiums and any Loss under this policy are payable
          in United States currency.

     N.   Assignment:  Assignment of interest under this policy shall not
          bind the Insurer unless and until its consent is endorsed hereon.

V.   DEFINITIONS

     A.   The terms "Wrongful Act" and "Loss" shall have the same meanings in
          this policy as are attributed to them in the Followed Policy.  The
          terms "Insurer", "Followed Policy", "Underlying Policies", "Policy
          Period" and "Aggregate Limit of Liability" shall have the meanings
          attributed to them in the Declarations.

     B.   The term "Insured Persons" shall mean those directors, officers and
          other individuals insured by the Followed Policy.

     C.   The term "Insured Company" shall mean the entity named in Item 1 of
          the Declarations and any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof insured
          by the Followed Policy.

     D.   The term "Policy Year" shall mean the period of one year following
          the inception of this policy or any anniversary, or, if the time
          between inception or any anniversary and the termination of this
          policy is less than one year, the lesser period.  If the discovery
          period hereunder is exercised as a result of the cancellation of or
          refusal to renew this policy by the Insurer, such period shall be
          considered a separate Policy Year.  If the discovery period is
          otherwise exercised, such period shall be part of the last Policy
          Year and not an additional period.

     E.   The term "Underlying Limit" shall mean an amount equal to the
          aggregate of all limits of liability as set forth in Item 2 of the
          Declarations for all Underlying Policies, plus the uninsured
          retention, if any, applicable to the primary insurance as set forth
          in Item 2 of the Declarations.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this policy has been mae, entered into and executed
by the Insurer in Hamilton, Bermuda as of the date set forth in the
Declarations.

                       DISCOVERY PERIOD ENDORSEMENT

It is agreed and acknowledged that Section IV(A) (Discovery Period) is
deleted and replaced in its entirety by the following:

IV(A)(1)  If the INSURER or the Insured Company cancels or elects not to
          renew this POLICY, then the INSURED persons or INSURED company
          shall have the right, upon payment of an additional premium of 100%
          of the sum of all premiums otherwise paid or due for the POLICY
          YEAR in which such election is made, to a continuation of the
          reporting period of this POLICY in respect of any CLAIMS first made
          against the INSURED persons or INSURED company or any of them
          during a period (hereinafter referred to as the "Discovery Period")
          after the end of the Policy Period, but only if the CLAIMS are
          based on WRONGFUL ACTS alleged to have been committed prior to the
          end of the POLICY PERIOD.  Such CLAIMS shall be deemed to have been
          made during the last POLICY YEAR provided that notification of each
          CLAIM is in accordance with Clause IV C below.  The right to elect
          the Discovery Period shall terminate, however, unless written
          notice of such election together with the additional premium is
          received by the INSURER within ten (10) days after the end of the
          POLICY PERIOD.  Any premium paid for the Discovery Period is not
          refundable.

     (2)  The length of the Discovery Period shall be the same amount of time
          as the length of the POLICY PERIOD, subject to a maximum Discovery
          Period of one year.

     (3)  The offer by the INSURER of renewal at a premium different from the
          premiums for the expiring POLICY YEAR shall not constitute an
          election by the INSURER not to renew this POLICY.

     (4)  The Discovery Period does not reinstate or increase the LIMIT OF
          LIABILITY of this POLICY.

       of any claim made against the Insured for any Wrongful Act and the
       Company shall have the right and duty to defend such claim against the
       Insured seeking such Damages, even if any of the allegations of the
       claim are groundless, false or fraudulent, and may make such
       investigation and settlement of any claim as it deems expedient, but
       the Company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to
       defend any suit after the applicable limit of the Company's liability
       has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.

II.    EXCLUSIONS.

       This insurance does not apply to any claim:

       (1) Arising out of any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act, or
       willful or reckless violation of any statute, but this exclusion does
       not apply to a claim upon which suit may be brought by reason of any
       alleged dishonesty on the part of the Insured, unless:

            (a) A judgment or other final adjudication thereof adverse to the
            Insured shall establish that acts of active deliberate dishonesty
            committed by the Insured was material to the cause of action so
            adjudicated or

            (b) The claim is a claim by or on behalf of a fidelity insurer
            against a natural person whose dishonesty has resulted in a loss

       and non-negotiable instruments or contracts representing money;

       (4) Arising out of the Insured's failure to comply with any law
       concerning Workers' Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Social
       Security or Disability Benefits, or any similar law; 

       (5) Arising out of the failure to procure or maintain adequate
       insurance or bonds on assets or property of the Trust or Employee
       Benefit Plan designated in the Declarations;

       advantage to which such Insured was not legally entitled or for the
       return by the Insured of any remuneration paid in fact to such Insured

       been in violation of law;

       (8) For the failure to collect contributions owed to the Trust or
       Employee Benefit Plan described in the Declarations from employers
       unless such failure is due to the negligence of the Insured or for the

V.     POLICY PERIOD: TERRITORY.   

       This insurance applies only to claims first made during the policy

       America, its territories or possessions or Canada; provided the
       Insured at the effective date of this insurance had no knowledge of
       or could not have reasonably foreseen any circumstances which might
       result in such claim.

VI.    LIMITS OF LIABILITY.

       Regardless of the number of persons or organizations bringing claims

(F-1191-B) 6-80                      2                           CAT.796638
                                                          PRINTED IN U.S.A.

<PAGE>

       number of persons or organizations insured hereunder, the total limit
       of the Company's liability to pay Damages because of all claims made
       against the Insured during any single policy year shall not exceed the
       amount shown in the Declarations as "Annual Aggregate Limit of
       Liability", regardless of time of payment.

       If the policy period described in the Declarations is for a term of
       more than one year, said "Annual Aggregate Limit of Liability" shall
       apply separately to each consecutive annual period.

VII.   CLAIMS MADE EXTENSION CLAUSE.

       If, during the policy period hereof, the Insured shall first become
       aware of any Wrongful Act which may subsequently give rise to a claim
       against any Insured and shall during the policy period hereof give
       written notice to the Company of such Wrongful Act, then any such
       claim which is subsequently made against the Insured arising out of
       such Wrongful Act shall for the purposes of this policy be deemed to
       have been first made against the Insured during the policy period.

VIII.  SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS.

       The Company will pay in addition to the limits of liability shown in
       the Declarations all costs, charges and expenses incurred by the
       Company in the investigation, settlement, defense and negotiation of
       any claim coming within the terms of this insurance, but, in the event
       of any judgment in excess of the amount of the aggregate limit
       available under this policy, the Company's liability for the costs and
       expenses incurred by it or with its consent shall be such proportion
       thereof as the amount of the aggregate limit available under this
       policy bears to the amount paid to dispose of the claim.  In no event
       shall the Company be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to
       defend or continue the defense of any suit after the aggregate limit
       of the Company's liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments
       or settlements.

       The Company will pay in addition to the Limits of Liability shown in
       the Declarations reasonable expenses incurred by the Insured at the
       Company's request.

IX.    CONSENT TO SETTLE.

       The Company may, with the written consent of the Insured, make such
       settlement or such compromise of any claim or suit as the Company
       deems expedient, and if the Insured shall refuse to consent to the
       settlement of any claim or suit recommended by the Company, based upon
       a judgment or a bonafide offer of settlement, the Insured shall
       thereafter negotiate or defend such claim or suit independently of the
       Company and on said Insured's own behalf, and in such event the
       Damages and expenses accruing or determined through litigation or
       otherwise in excess of the amount for which settlement could have been
       made as so recommended by the Company shall not be recoverable under
       this policy.

X.     EXTENSION CLAUSE.

       It is agreed that at any time prior to termination or cancellation of
       this policy as an entirety, whether by the Insured or by the Company,
       the Insured may give to the Company notice that it desires to be
       insured for an additional period of twelve (12) months after the
       effective date of termination or cancellation, at an additional
       premium of 25% of the premium hereunder, for claims made against the
       Insured during the said twelve (12) month period by reason of a
       Wrongful Act committed or alleged to have been committed prior to the
       effective date of termination or cancellation and which would be
       otherwise insured by this policy, subject to the following provisions:

            (a) Such additional period shall be deemed part of the policy
            period and not an addition thereto;

            (b) Such additional period of time shall terminate forthwith on
            the effective date of any other insurance obtained by the Insured
            or its successors in business, replacing in whole or in part the
            insurance afforded by this policy.  Where such other policy
            provides no coverage for loss sustained prior to its effective
            date, it shall not be deemed to be a replacement of this policy.

       If the policy period described in the Declarations is for a term of
       more than one year, the maximum premium for this extension shall be
       25% of the equivalent annual premium.

XI.    CONDITIONS.    

       (1) Insureds Duties In The Event Of Occurrence, Claim Or Suit.

       It is a condition precedent to the application of all insurance
       afforded herein that:

            (a) In the event the Insured shall first become aware of any
            claim or allegation of a Wrongful Act, or any occurrence which
            might reasonably give rise to such claim or allegation of a
            Wrongful Act, written notice containing particulars sufficient
            to identify the Insured and any claimant and also reasonably
            obtainable information with respect to the time, place and
            circumstances thereof, and the names and addresses of the injured
            parties and of available witnesses, shall be given by or for the
            Insured to the Company or any of its authorized agents as soon
            as practicable;

            (b) If claim is made or suit is brought against an Insured, the
            Insured or Insurance Representative shall immediately forward to
            the Company every demand, notice, summons or other process
            received;

            (c) The Insured shall cooperate with the Company and, upon the
            Company's request, assist in making settlements, in the conduct
            of suits and in enforcing any right of contribution or indemnity
            against any person or organization who may be liable to the
            Insured because of an act with respect to which insurance is
            afforded under this policy; and the Insured shall attend hearings
            and trials and assist in securing and giving evidence and
            obtaining the attendance of witnesses.  The Insured shall not
            voluntarily assume or admit any liability, nor, except at said
            Insured's own cost, voluntarily make any payment, assume any
            obligations or incur any expense without the Company's prior
            written consent.

       (2) Action Against The Company.

       No action shall lie against the Company unless, as a condition
       precedent thereto, there shall have been full compliance with all of
       the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the Insured's
       obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by
       judgment against the Insured after actual trial or by written
       agreement of the Insured, the claimant and the Company.

       Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has
       secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be
       entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance
       afforded by this policy.  No person or organization shall have any
       right under this policy to join the Company as a party to any action
       against the Insured to determine the Insured's liability nor shall the
       Company be impleaded by the Insured or said Insured's legal
       representative.  Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Insured or of the
       Insured's estate shall not relieve the Company of any of its
       obligations hereunder.

       (3) Other Insurance.

       This insurance shall apply only as excess insurance over any other
       valid and collectible insurance available to the Insured.

       (4) Subrogation.

       In the event of any payment under this policy, the Company shall be
       subrogated to all the Insured's rights of recovery therefor against
       any person or organization and the Insured shall execute and deliver
       instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure
       such rights.  The Insured shall do nothing after loss to prejudice
       such rights.

       (5) Changes.

       Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any
       other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this
       policy or estop the Company from asserting any right under the terms
       of this policy, nor shall the terms of this policy be waived or
       changed, except by endorsement issued to form a part of this policy.

       (6) Assignment.

       Assignment of interest under this policy shall not bind the Company
       until its consent is endorsed hereon; if, however, the Insured shall
       become incompetent or die, such insurance as is afforded by this
       policy shall apply to the Insured's legal representative as an
       Insured, but only while acting within the scope of said Insured's
       duties as such.

       (7) Cancellation.

       This policy may be cancelled on behalf of the Insureds at any time by
       written notice to the Company.  This policy may also be cancelled on
       behalf of the Company by mailing to the Insurance Representative at
       the address of the Trust or Plan shown in the Declarations, written
       notice stating when, not less than thirty (30) days thereafter, the
       cancellation shall become effective.  The mailing of such notice shall
       be sufficient proof of notice, and this policy shall terminate at the
       date and hour specified in such notice.

                                     3

<PAGE>

       If this policy shall be cancelled by the Insureds the Company shall
       retain the customary short rate proportion of the premium hereon.

       If this policy shall be cancelled by or on behalf of the Company, the
       Company shall retain the pro-rata proportion of the premium hereon. 
       Payment or tender of any unearned premium by the Company shall not be
       a condition precedent to the effectiveness of cancellation, but such
       payment shall be made as soon as practicable.

       (8)  Declarations.

       By acceptance of this policy, each Insured agrees that the statements
       in the Application attached to this policy are said Insured's
       agreements and representations, that this policy is issued in reliance
       upon the truth of such representations and that this policy embodies
       all agreements existing between said Insured and the Company or any
       of its agents relating to this insurance.

       (9)  Authorization.

       By acceptance of this policy, the Insurance Representative agrees to
       act on behalf of all Insureds with respect to the payment of premiums
       and the receiving of any return premiums that may become due under
       this policy, and the receiving of all notices of cancellation, non-
       renewal or change of coverages and the Insureds agree that they have,
       individually and collectively, delegated this authority exclusively
       to the Insurance Representative.  Nothing herein shall relieve each
       Insured from giving any notice to the Company that is required under
       Condition (1) of the policy.

       (10) Recourse.

       In the event that an Insured breaches any fiduciary obligation imposed
       by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as it may be
       amended from time to time, it is agreed that the Company has the right
       of recourse against any such Insured for any amount paid by the
       Company on account of such a breach of fiduciary obligation, but the
       Company shall have no such right of recourse if this policy has been
       purchased by an Employer or by an Employee organization.

       (11) Liberalization Clause.

       If during the period that insurance is in force under this policy, or
       within 45 days prior to the inception date thereof, on behalf of the
       Company there be adopted, or filed with and approved or accepted by
       the insurance supervisory authorities, all in conformity with law, any
       changes in the form attached to this policy by which this form of
       insurance could be extended or broadened without increased premium
       charge by endorsement or substitution of form, then such extended or
       broadened insurance shall inure to the benefit of the Insured
       hereunder as though such endorsement or substitution of form had been
       made.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this policy to be signed
by its President and a Secretary at Hartford, Connecticut, and countersigned
on the Declarations page by a duly authorized agent of the Company.

       This insurance applies only to claims first made during the policy
       period described in the Declarations within the United States of
       America, its territories or possessions or Canada; provided the
       Insured at the effective date of this insurance, or at the time the

       or could not have reasonably foreseen any circumstances which might
       result in such claim; but this insurance shall not apply to claims
       arising out of any Wrongful Act of which the Insured became aware

       (4) "Prior Similar Coverage" shall mean insurance which provides in

       date of this policy.

It is agreed that the policy is amended as follows:

1.     By deleting paragraph (1) of Section II. EXCLUSIONS and substituting
       the following therefor:

       (1) Arising out of any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act, or
       willful violation of any statute, but this exclusion does not apply
       a claim upon which suit may be brought by reason of any alleged
       dishonesty on the part of the Insured, unless:

2.     By deleting Section X. EXTENSION CLAUSE in its entirety and
       substituting the following therefor:

       X. EXTENSION CLAUSE.

       It is agreed that if the Company terminates or refuses to renew this
       policy, the Insured may give to the Company notice that it desires to
       be insured for an additional period of twelve (12) months after the
       effective date of termination or nonrenewal, provided that written
       notice of its desire to be insured for said additional period is given
       to the Company prior to the effective date of termination or
       nonrenewal of the policy by the Company or within 10 days following
       the effective date of termination or nonrenewal.

       If the Insured terminates this policy or declines to accept renewal,
       the Insured may give to the Company notice that it desires to be
       insured for an additional period of twelve (12) months after the
       effective date of termination or nonrenewal, provided that written
       notice of its desire to be insured for said additional period is given
       to the Company prior to the effective date of termination or
       nonrenewal.

       The Company, at its sole option, may grant further extension periods
       beyond the twelve (12) months provided for herein.

       The insurance afforded during any extension period or periods shall
       apply only to claims made against the Insured during the said
       extension period or periods by reason of a Wrongful Act committed or
       alleged to have been committed prior to the effective date of
       termination or nonrenewal and which would be otherwise insured by this
       policy, subject to the following provisions:

            (a) Such additional period shall be deemed part of the policy
            period and not an addition thereto;

            (b) Such additional period of time shall terminate forthwith on
            the effective date of any other insurance obtained by the Insured
            or its successors in business, replacing in whole or in part the
            insurance afforded by this policy.  Where such other policy
            provides no coverage for loss sustained prior to its effective
            date, it shall not be deemed to be a replacement of this policy.

       The Insured shall pay to the Company an additional premium of 25% of
       the equivalent annual premium hereunder for each 12 month period of
       extension.

3.     By deleting subsection (1)(a) of Section XI. CONDITIONS and
       substituting the following therefor:

            (a) In the event the Insured shall first become aware of any
            claim or allegation of a Wrongful Act, written notice of such
            claim or allegation shall be given by or for the Insured to the
            Company or any of its authorized agents as soon as practicable
            and the Insured shall give the Company such information
            concerning such claim or allegation as the Company shall
            reasonably require.

committed by the Insured or by any natural person for whose Wrongful Act the
Insured is legally liable.

The Company shall have the right and duty to defend the Insured in any claim
seeking pecuniary or nonpecuniary relief for a Wrongful Act even if the
allegations of the claim are groundless, false or fraudulent, and may make
such investigation and settlement of any claim as it deems expedient, or may,
at its sole option, give its written consent to the defense by the Insured of
such claim, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or
judgment or to defend any suit, nor pay for the defense of any suit being
conducted by the Insured with the Company's written consent, after the
applicable limit of the Company's liability has been exhausted by payment of
judgments or settlements.
