                                     PART I


Item 1.            BUSINESS

                   (a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

                   Premier Industrial Corporation was incorporated in Ohio in
1946 as the successor to a partnership formed in 1940.  Its executive offices
are located at 4500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44103.  As used herein, the
term "Premier" or the "Corporation" means Premier Industrial Corporation and
its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

                   Premier is a leading distributor of electronic components
and also distributes, and in some cases manufactures, a wide range of products
used to repair and maintain equipment, machinery, vehicles and buildings.  In
addition, Premier is a leading producer of high performance fire-fighting
components for the original equipment and replacement markets.

                   (b)    FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

                   Financial information about each of Premier's industry
segments for the last three fiscal years, which is included in the table under
the heading "Industry Segment Information" on page 10 of the Corporation's 1994
Annual Report to its shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.

                   (c)    NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS.

                   ELECTRONICS DISTRIBUTION.  The Electronics Distribution
Group distributes a wide array of electronic and electrical products.  Its
product line consists of microprocessors, switches, relays, semiconductors,
hand tools, electronic interconnection devices, integrated circuits, factory
automation components, capacitors, resistors, connectors, test equipment, heat
sinks, terminals, coils, motor controls, cable ties, clamps, mounts, alligator
clips, electrical terminals, and associated equipment.

                   The Electronics Distribution Group services a diverse
customer base in the original equipment and maintenance/repair/operations
markets and manufacturers of computer and data processing equipment,
communications equipment, industrial controls and processing equipment, and
test and measuring equipment, as well as radio and television broadcast
stations, schools, governmental agencies, electrical contractors, electronic
service dealers, and industrial customers.

                   Each of the divisions within the Electronics Distribution
Group maintains its own sales force.  Inside and outside sales personnel, and
in certain cases, manufacturers' representatives, conduct sales by telephone,
direct contact or mail order.  Comprehensive catalogs are published by several
divisions for use as data and purchasing references by engineers, purchasing
agents and maintenance personnel in a wide range of businesses.
<PAGE>   6
                   GENERAL PRODUCTS.  The principal products included within
the General Products Group are:  high performance cap screws, nuts, washers,
screws, specialty fasteners and industrial shop supplies; replacement parts and
special hardware for cars and trucks, including heavy-duty fasteners, special
hardware and parts for construction equipment; special welding electrodes,
brazing alloys, fluxes, solders and welding aids; electrical systems
components, such as terminals, connectors, fittings, clamps and building
hardware; cleaners, floor care products, drain maintenance systems; pavement
maintenance products and accessories for parking lots and recreational areas;
adhesives, chemicals for the automotive industry; plastic repair products,
engine oils and greases for heavy-duty diesel-driven equipment; specialty
greases and gear lubricants for heavy industry; heavy-duty electrical cord,
cable and associated devices; and fire-fighting components, including nozzles,
valves, and specialized fire-fighting equipment.

                   The General Products Group serves a wide range of customers
and markets.  Products are sold to original equipment, industrial, construction
and transportation companies, and commercial, public and institutional users,
primarily for maintenance and repair.  Markets also include municipal fire
departments, the military services and fire truck manufacturers.

                   The product lines mentioned above are marketed through
separate divisions.  Each division has its own distinct sales force.  Products
are sold by field representatives, inside sales personnel and outside dealers
and distributors.

                   OTHER.  In addition to the foregoing, Premier has interests
in limited partnerships which own and manage rental properties, as described
under Item 2 of this report.

                   ADDITIONAL BUSINESS INFORMATION.  No one class of products
has accounted for 10 percent or more of consolidated revenues of either
industry segment in any of the last three fiscal years.  As an example, Newark
Electronics, Premier's largest division, offers products from over 285 vendors,
no one of which has had a material impact on its business as a whole.  No new
product line or business requiring the investment of a material amount of total
assets was announced by any industry segment during the most recent fiscal
year.

                   Premier and its subsidiaries obtain raw materials and
finished products from a wide variety of sources.  Purchases by Premier of
finished products for distribution involve significant dollar volumes annually
in the case of certain suppliers, but Premier does not believe that the loss of
any particular supplier would have a material adverse effect on its business as
a whole.

                   The industry segments of Premier are not deemed to be
dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or
concession.

                   Seasonality is not a significant factor in the business of
Premier considered as a whole or in either of its industry segments.

                   Premier requires large amounts of working capital to carry
substantial inventories needed to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers
in each of its industry segments.

                   No material part of the business of any industry segment of
Premier is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.  No single
customer accounts for 2 percent or more of Premier's consolidated operating 
revenues.
<PAGE>   7
                   Backlog is not significant in any industry segment of
Premier.

                   No material portion of any industry segment is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the government.

                   COMPETITION.  Substantial competition is encountered in all
industry segments.  Competitors include both large and small specialized firms,
as well as large diversified businesses.  Premier is one of the larger national
distributors of industrial electronic components.  It functions as a single
source supplier to a broad range of customers in the maintenance, repair and
operations market, as well as to original equipment manufacturers.
Product availability and service are key factors in maintaining a strong
competitive position in the industry.

                   In the General Products industry segment, Premier has
specialized in product lines and markets where it can provide unique customer
benefits.  Performance and customer service are more important competitive
factors than price in this industry segment.  Premier believes it is a major
supplier in several of its product lines.

                   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  The amount spent by Premier on
research activities relating to the development of new products and services or
the improvement of existing products and services was approximately $3,500,000
for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1994 and $3,400,000 for each of the fiscal
years ended May 31, 1993 and 1992.  Virtually all such activities were
sponsored by Premier rather than by customers.

                   ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION.  Compliance with federal, state
and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment is not
expected to have a material effect upon the earnings, financial condition or
competitive position of Premier.  In certain cases, the Corporation has
initiated remedial activities at its owned facilities.  The estimated costs of
such activities, which are not material, have been fully provided for in the
Corporation's financial statements.

                   The Corporation also has been involved with several
third-party waste disposal sites in various states at which it has been named a
potentially responsible party under applicable environmental laws.  Such laws
can impose joint and several liability upon each party at a given site;
however, the extent of the Corporation's allocated financial contribution to
the investigation and remediation of these sites is expected to be limited
based on the number of other companies involved in the process and the
relatively small volume of waste attributed to the Corporation.  Although it is
difficult to quantify the potential impact of compliance at these sites, based
on current information, management believes that the ultimate costs of these
matters will not have a material impact on the earnings, financial condition or
competitive position of Premier.

                   EMPLOYEES AND SALES FORCE.  Premier had approximately 4,300
persons in its employ as of May 31, 1994.  As of that date, a sales force of
approximately 2,500 persons, including employees and independent agents, was
engaged in the sale and distribution of Premier products.

                   (d)    FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

                   Premier has direct selling operations (through subsidiaries)
in eight foreign countries.  Financial information about
<PAGE>   8
foreign and domestic operations appears as Note 12 (Segment Information) to the
Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements on page 17 of its 1994 Annual
Report to shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In
addition, Premier is engaged in export sales.

Item 2.            PROPERTIES

                   Premier has facilities, including general and sales offices,
distribution centers, manufacturing plants and research facilities, in 207
locations in the United States, Canada and Europe.  Of these facilities, those
owned in fee by Premier contain approximately 2,100,000 square feet and are
located on sites consisting of approximately 155 acres of land.  Premier also
owns vacant land adjacent to some of its facilities for future expansion.

                   Facilities leased by Premier contain approximately 528,000
square feet.  No single lease is material to the business of any industry
segment.

                   The Electronics Distribution segment, headquartered in
Chicago, Illinois, has 142 locations, the majority of which are leased sales
offices.  Major distribution centers are located in Chicago, Illinois and
Gaffney, South Carolina, with smaller distribution centers located elsewhere in
the United States and in Canada and the United Kingdom.  The General Products
segment, with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio, maintains numerous distribution
centers and sales offices in the United States, Canada and Europe, along with
manufacturing facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cleveland, Ohio and
Wooster, Ohio.  The Premier executive offices, corporate staff and principal
research and development activities are located in its Cleveland, Ohio
facilities.

                   Premier has interests in limited partnerships which own and
operate rental properties located in Arlington, Virginia, consisting of
residential units and an office building.

                   Management believes that the facilities utilized by Premier
in the conduct of its business are suitable for their intended use.

Item 3.            LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

                   There are at the date of this report no material pending
legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the
business, to which Premier is a party or to which any of its property is
subject.

Item 4.            SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

                   No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders
during the quarter ended May 31, 1994.

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Premier Industrial Corporation:



Under date of July 21, 1994, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of
Premier Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 1994,
as contained in the 1994 annual report to shareholders.  These consolidated
financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in
the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 1994.  In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we
also have audited the related financial statement schedules as listed in Part
IV, Item 14(a)(2).  These financial statement schedules are the responsibility
of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the financial statement schedules based on our audits.

In our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   1994 VERSUS 1993 -- Operating revenues of $739,520,000 were 7%, or
$48,667,000, higher than the prior year, reflecting continued increases in the
results of the Electronics Distribution Group. Expanded product lines and
domestic and international sales-building programs contributed to the
increases.
   Cost of sales, at 54% of operating revenues, was approximately one
percentage point higher in 1994 when compared with 1993 results, mainly due to
changes in product mix.
   Selling, administrative and general expenses rose only 3%, or $5,542,000,
compared with 1993. Higher levels of expenses were partially related to the
increased revenue activity and to the funding of business-building programs
involving enhanced operating systems and expanded distribution facilities.
These increases were offset, in part, by benefits from expense control
programs.
   The foregoing factors were the primary components of a net earnings increase
of 7%. As a result of the increase in net earnings and a 1% reduction in the
average number of common shares outstanding, earnings per share rose 8% to
$1.10 from $1.02 in the prior year.

   1993 VERSUS 1992 -- Operating revenues of $690,853,000 were up 8%, or
$50,015,000, compared with the prior year and benefited from gains from a
number of sales-building programs, principally in the Electronics Distribution
Group. These business-building programs included areas such as expansion and
refinement of product lines, enhanced selling systems and expanded distribution
facilities.
   Other income decreased $1,090,000 primarily as a result of lower investment
yields, more than offsetting the income generated from a higher level of
investments. An increase in cost of sales of 11% was primarily related to the
revenue gain. Selling, administrative and general expenses were about even with
1992, as expense control efforts continued.
   Primarily as a result of the foregoing factors, net earnings and earnings
per share each increased approximately 12%.  

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CASH FLOWS 
(FINANCIAL CONDITION)
   The Company continues to maintain a solid financial condition. At May 31,
l994, working capital of $355,021,000 compared with $336,089,000 at the end of
the prior fiscal year. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities at
May 31, 1994, was 8.4 to l, compared with an 8 to l current ratio at May 31,
1993. The Company requires significant funds to carry extensive product
inventories, as product availability and customer service, including rapid
delivery, are key factors in maintaining a strong competitive position in each
industry segment. In addition, the Company maintains cash and invested funds to
meet growth opportunities, including business expansion, new division start-ups
and acquisitions, and to have internal capital available for distributions to
shareholders. The Company continues to develop growth plans and to search for
suitable acquisitions.
   The Company's long-term debt of $6,500,000 in variable
rate industrial development bonds represents less than 2% of total
capitalization at May 31, 1994. 
   The Company's principal source of cash continues to be that provided by
operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates as a
result of variations in operating income, receivable and inventory levels, and
the timing of payment of liabilities and taxes.  In fiscal 1994, inventories
increased $23,777,000 to $155,261,000, principally as a result of new products
and additional inventory required to support the higher sales level. The
Company expects that earnings generally will provide sufficient cash to meet
the Company's presently anticipated needs for cash. 
   Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures for
equipment to maintain and enhance operating capabilities and for facilities
necessary to better serve customers. Fiscal 1994 property, plant and equipment
additions of $12,177,000 were higher than the amount invested in fixed asset
additions in each of the two previous years. Included in 1994 were expenditures
toward the construction of a new distribution facility for the Electronics
Distribution Group that will be equipped and become operational in fiscal 1995.
Fiscal 1995 capital expenditures should be similar to fiscal 1994, primarily as
a result of normal purchases to equip, maintain and enhance operating
capabilities and the opening of the new distribution facility noted above.
   Investing activities also include the investment of certain funds being
retained for future business use. These investments are treated as temporary
investments and, like cash and cash equivalents, are held for short periods of
time. Changes in investments occur on a regular basis to take advantage of
changes in yield and to match cash flow requirements. In fiscal 1994, temporary
investments decreased $13,393,000 as a result of these factors.

MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW
(Continued)
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Net cash used in financing activities for 1994, 1993 and 1992 included
dividends paid to shareholders of $32,629,000, $29,437,000 and $26,442,000,
respectively. The Company from time to time, in response to unsolicited offers
to buy Premier common stock, purchases shares of its common stock which are
then held as treasury shares to fund its stock option plan and for general
corporate purposes. In fiscal 1994, the Company purchased 1,853,000 of its
shares for $46,400,000. Consistent with prior years, the Company also received
payments from its management employees for stock reserved for issuance to them
under the Company's 1973 Stock Option Plan, as amended.

losses are recorded in shareholders' equity, and realized gains and losses are
reflected in income.  

(C) CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents, which are retained for future use in the business, include
short-term investments purchased with maturities of three months or less.  

(D) TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS 
Other funds retained for future use in the business are temporarily invested in
marketable securities generally held for periods not to exceed one year and are
carried principally at cost which approximates market value determined based on
quoted market prices.  

(E) INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on
the basis of either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or on the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method and market on the basis of the lower of replacement
cost or net realizable value.  

(F) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various assets and
is computed principally using the straight-line method.

(G) OTHER ASSETS
Goodwill acquired subsequent to the effective date of APB Opinion No. 17, is
being amortized over a period of 40 years on a straight-line basis; goodwill
acquired prior to that date is not being amortized ($8,535,000). Certain other
intangible assets are being amortized over their respective economic lives. 

(H) INCOME TAXES 
Effective June 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (Statement 109). Prior to June
1, 1993, the Company followed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
96, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under Statement 109 deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This change to adopt Statement
109 had no material impact on the Company's financial statements.  

(I) EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares
and common stock equivalents outstanding during each year.  

(J) RECLASSIFICATIONS 
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior
years' data to the current presentation. 


(2) INVENTORIES  

The Company's inventories consist primarily of finished goods. Costs of certain
inventories are determined using the dollar value LIFO method (approximately 9%
and 10% of total inventory at current cost at May 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively). If all inventory costs were determined on a FIFO basis,
inventories would have been $6,636,000 and $6,931,000 higher than reported at
May 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

(8) PENSION PLANS

The Company maintains non-contributory pension plans covering
substantially all of its employees. Plan benefits for most employees are

AUDITORS' REPORT                                                     EXHIBIT 13j

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Premier Industrial Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Premier
Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 1994. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.  

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Premier Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries at May 31, 1994 and
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended May 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
