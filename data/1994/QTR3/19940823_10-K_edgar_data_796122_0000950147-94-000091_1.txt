Item 1.  Business

GENERAL

Continental Homes Holding Corp. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was
formed in June 1986. The Company designs, constructs and sells single-family
homes for the entry-level and move-up buyer in Phoenix, Arizona; Austin and San
Antonio, Texas; Denver, Colorado and Southern California. The Company entered
the Austin, Texas market in July 1993 through the acquisition of Milburn
Investments, Inc., a Texas Corporation, and its related entities (collectively,
"Milburn"). In January 1994, the Company acquired the operations of Aspen Homes
("Aspen"), a single family homebuilder in San Antonio, Texas. The Company also
offers mortgage banking services in Arizona to its homebuyers and in Texas to
its homebuyers and to third parties.

LAND ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT

As of May 31, 1994, the Company operated 14 subdivisions in Phoenix, 13
subdivisions in Austin, four subdivisions in Denver, six subdivisions in San
Antonio and two subdivisions in Southern California. The following table
summarizes the Company's available lot inventory at May 31, 1994 by location:

(1)      Speculative units are unsold homes under construction.

The Company's objective is to maintain a supply of land to meet anticipated
homebuilding requirements for approximately two years. At May 31, 1993 and 1994,
the Company had an aggregate of 2,563 and 6,807 unsold lots, respectively, which
represents an average of approximately a twenty-nine month inventory based on
actual deliveries in fiscal 1994. The Company believes that an adequate supply
of undeveloped land is available in Phoenix, Austin and Denver to maintain
current levels of homebuilding. The Company employs experienced supervisory
personnel who deal directly with independent engineers and contractors in the
development process, including land and site planning and constructing site
facilities (such as roads, sewers, water and other public facilities and
amenities). See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."

As of May 31, 1994, the Company also owned 417 acres in Carlsbad, California,
located in San Diego County. The master plan for this project, which will result
in approximately 780 single- family homes, was approved by the Carlsbad City
Council in July 1993. The Company is currently working with various governmental
agencies regarding environmental issues with regard to the property. The Company
is unable to predict the date on which all additional approvals necessary to
commence development will be received, but it is currently actively seeking
these additional approvals and will commence development as soon as permissible.

PRODUCT LINES

As of May 31, 1994 the Company had active sales programs in 14 subdivisions in
Phoenix, in 13 subdivisions in Austin, in four subdivisions in Denver, in six
subdivisions in San Antonio, and in two subdivisions in Southern California. The
product line constructed by the Company in a particular subdivision is dependent
upon many factors, including the housing generally available in the area, the
needs of the particular market and the Company's cost of lots in the
subdivision. The Company typically offers between three and twelve floorplans
within the same product line in each subdivision and often offers the same
models in similar subdivisions. Models are periodically reviewed and updated to
reflect changing homebuyer preferences. Both new models and design modifications
are developed by Company employees.

Homes sold by the Company typically have three to five bedrooms, two or more
bathrooms and at least a two car garage. The Company offers a variety of options
and upgrades, including the placement of certain walls, the style of kitchen and
bathroom cabinetry, a selection of floor coverings and light fixtures, patios,
decks, french doors and fireplaces, which allow homebuyers to customize their
homes. Options and upgrades are generally priced to have a positive effect on
profit margins.

______________________

(1)      The Company currently is not building any townhomes or duplex homes 
         and has no plans to do so in the future.

Fluctuations in the number of homes delivered by product type are generally
related to product availability or the introduction of a new product.

CONTRACT BACKLOG

Sales of the Company's homes are made pursuant to standard sales contracts which
require a $500 to $2,500 deposit upon signing. The contract is generally
cancelable if the customer is unable to obtain a mortgage commitment, usually
within 60 days. A sale becomes part of backlog only upon receipt of a signed
contract and a deposit.  See "Business -- Construction and Customer Service."

As of May 31, 1994, the Company's contract backlog had an aggregate sales value
of $147,242,000 and consisted of 1,136 homes. The contract backlog as of May 31,
1993 had an aggregate sales value of $107,499,000 and consisted of 900 homes.
The Company anticipates that substantially all of the homes in backlog at May
31, 1994 will close by the end of calendar 1994.

MARKETING

The Company markets its homes to first-time and move-up buyers. Although the
Company utilizes the services of independent brokers, approximately 41% of its
homes sold in fiscal 1994 were sold by Company commissioned personnel (without
the assistance of independent brokers) from sales offices located in furnished
model homes in the subdivisions. Even when independent brokers are involved,
Company personnel are available to assist prospective buyers by providing them
with floorplans, price information, tours of model homes and selection of
options. Sales personnel are trained by the Company and attend weekly meetings
to be updated on financing availability, construction schedules and marketing
and advertising plans. Company sales personnel and independent brokers are
generally paid a commission at the time of closing equal to 1 1/2% (2% in
Austin) and 3%, respectively, of the sales price of the home. The Company uses
radio, newspaper, magazine, billboard displays, special promotional events and,
occasionally, television in its marketing program.

The Company builds its homes under the guidelines and specifications of the
Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") and the Veterans Administration ("VA"),
thereby providing prospective buyers the added benefits of FHA-insured and
VA-guaranteed mortgages.

CONSTRUCTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE

The Company designs and supervises the development and building of its projects.
Its homes generally are designed to promote efficient use of space and building
materials and to minimize construction costs and time. The construction period
for the Company's homes during fiscal 1994 ranged from 100 to 180 days in
Phoenix, from 75 to 120 days in Texas, from 120 to 180 days in Denver and from
100 to 150 days in Southern California.

The actual construction is performed for a fixed price by independent
subcontractors, who are generally selected on a competitive basis. All stages of
construction are supervised by the Company's on-site superintendents who
coordinate the activities of subcontractors, subject their work to quality and
cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. The
Company's management information systems also assist the Company in controlling
the costs of construction by making information available which allows the
Company to monitor subcontractor performance and expenditures. The Company
believes its relationships with its subcontractors are good. The Company is not,
and does not anticipate, experiencing a significant shortage of either
subcontractors or building materials.

After a home is completed, but prior to closing, a Company employee accompanies
the buyer on a home orientation and inspection tour and if any repairs are
necessary, they are undertaken by the Company or its subcontractors. The Company
provides homebuyers with a one-year warranty on its homes for non-structural
defects and a two-year warranty with respect to structural defects. In addition,
the Company purchases, in certain locations, builder's liability insurance
protection for major structural defects in the third through tenth year.

In Phoenix, Denver and Southern California, the Company constructs homes
principally against orders which are evidenced by written contracts and modest
escrow deposits. In fiscal 1994, approximately 18% of such contracts have been
cancelled, a majority of such cancellations being attributable to the inability
of the prospective purchaser to qualify for financing. The Company attempts to
limit cancellations by training its sales force to determine the qualification
of potential homebuyers at the sales office. The Company classifies a unit as
speculative when construction commences on a unit that does not have a written
contract. The Company may construct speculative units in order to maintain an
inventory for quick delivery or to continue the construction sequence. The
majority of the Company's speculative units are less than 50% complete. In order
to take advantage of an opportunity in the Phoenix market created by a shortage
of homes for quick delivery in that market, the Company has recently increased
the number of speculative units under construction in Phoenix. Historically, the
Texas market constructs a proportionately larger number of speculative units
than the Company's other markets. As a result of such cancellations and
construction procedures, at May 31, 1993 and May 31, 1994, the Company had
respectively, 184 and 503 (including 219 in Texas) speculative units under
construction.

MORTGAGE BANKING

The Company commenced mortgage banking operations in 1986 and all mortgage
operations of the Company are currently conducted by American Western Mortgage
Company ("AWMC") and Miltex Management, Inc. ("MMI"), which are approved by the
FHA and VA as qualified mortgage lenders. For the year ended May 31, 1994, AWMC
and MMI provided mortgage financing for more than 59% and 77% of the Company's
customers in Phoenix and Austin, respectively.

As mortgage bankers, AWMC and MMI complete the processing of loan applications,
perform credit checks, submit applications to mortgage lenders for approval, and
originate and sell mortgage loans. AWMC and MMI have $15,000,000 and $10,000,000
warehouse lines of credit, respectively to fund the mortgage loans on an interim
basis. AWMC and MMI bear the interest expense and receive the interest income
while mortgages are warehoused. Accordingly, depending upon the relative
interest rates of such loans and the related mortgages and the extent to which
mortgages are financed, AWMC and MMI may have net interest income or expense
during the warehouse period.

AWMC and MMI establish their interest rates and terms to facilitate the sale of
the Company's homes through the origination of first mortgage loans utilizing
programs established by the FHA, VA, GNMA and FNMA. Interest rates are generally
established by prevailing market rates, although lower rates may be offered from
time to time to remain competitive in certain markets.

Each mortgage originated by AWMC and MMI contains the provision for a servicing
fee (which is included as a part of the monthly payment made by the mortgagor)
to be paid for the collection of, and accounting for, mortgage payments. This
servicing fee provision is a separate interest in the mortgage that may be sold
independently of, or together with, the mortgage itself. AWMC began retaining a
portion of the servicing portfolio in fiscal 1991 and has continued to do so,
although this is not expected to become a material part of the Company's
business.

COMPETITION

The single-family residential housing industry is highly competitive, and the
Company competes in each of its markets with numerous other national, regional
and local homebuilders, some of which have greater resources than the Company.
The Company's homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage
financing terms and location. See "Business -- Operating Strategy." The Company
also competes with developers of rental housing units and, to a lesser extent,
condominiums.

REGULATION

The housing and mortgage banking industries are subject to extensive and complex
regulations. The Company and its subcontractors must comply with various
federal, state and local laws and regulations including zoning and density
requirements, building, environmental, advertising and consumer credit rules and
regulations as well as other rules and regulations in connection with its

materials to be used, building designs and minimum elevation of properties. The
Company's homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes
eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the FHA and VA, respectively,

other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in
certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

                       THIRD AMENDMENT TO LEASE AGREEMENT

                 THIS THIRD AMENDMENT TO LEASE AGREEMENT, dated this 27th day of
June , 1994, is entered into between SCOTTSDALE SEVILLE ASSOCIATES, an Arizona
general partnership, as Landlord, and CONTINENTAL HOMES HOLDING CORP., a
Delaware corporation, as Tenant.

                                  WITNESSETH:

                 WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant previously entered into that
certain Lease Agreement dated July 16, 1990, as amended by that certain First
Amendment to Lease Agreement dated August 1, 1990, as amended by that certain
Second Amendment to Lease Agreement dated February 8, 1991, (collectively the
"Lease"); and

                 WHEREAS, Tenant desires to extend the term of the Lease and
Landlord is willing to extend the term of the Lease; and

                 WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant wish to execute this Third
Amendment in order to amend the Lease to extend the lease term and to reflect
certain other occurrences;

                 NOW THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1. Definitions. All capitalized terms used in this Third
Amendment which are not defined in this Third Amendment shall have the meanings
for such terms which are set forth in the Lease.

                  2. Term. The Term of the Lease is hereby extended for a period
of five (5) years, commencing on March 18, 1996 and ending on March 17, 2001
(the "First Renewal Term").

                  3. Rent. During the First Renewal Term, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord rent for the Premises as follows:

                  Year of First Renewal Term            Monthly Rent
                  --------------------------            ------------

                  Year 1 through 5             $37,300.00 (based on $20.00 per
                                               rentable square foot per year).

From the date of this Third Amendment to Lease Agreement through March 18, 1996,
rent shall continue to be paid in accordance with the Lease.

All other terms and conditions of Article 3 of the Lease shall remain in full
force and effect.


                 4. Rental Adjustment. Tenant obligation to pay Direct Expenses
during the First Renewal Term shall be computed using a base year rather than
the Direct Expense Stop referenced in the Lease. Therefore following the
commencement of the First Renewal Term, the ninth paragraph of Article 5 of the
Lease shall be deleted. The base year ("Base Year") for purposes of computing
Tenant's obligation shall be calendar year 1996 or $6.00 per rentable square
foot, whichever is greater. During the First Renewal Term Tenant shall pay its
Proportionate Share of the amount by which the Direct Expenses for each calendar
year exceeds the Direct Expenses for the Base Year.

                 The 1996 Base Year assumes increases of not greater than four
percent (4%) per year for calendar years 1995 and 1996 over the actual 1994
non-controllable expenses (i.e., utilities, insurance and real estate taxes).
Should non-controllable expenses increase by more than four percent (4%) per
year over 1994 actuals, the Base Year shall be adjusted accordingly.

                 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
during the First Renewal Term Tenant's Proportionate Share of Controllable
Direct Expenses shall not increase by more than five percent (5%) per year.

                 5. Tenant's Proportionate Share of Direct Expenses. Effective
upon the commencement of the First Renewal Term, the third paragraph of Article
5 of the Lease shall be amended to read as follows:

                 "Tenant's Proportionate Share of Direct Expenses: Additional
rent in an amount equal to 25.13% (which percentage has been obtained by
dividing 22,380 rentable square feet, which equals the rentable area in the
Premises, by 89,053 square feet, which equals the rentable area in the Building)
of the Direct Expenses."

                 6. Tenant Improvements. Landlord shall pay to Tenant a tenant
improvement allowance in the amount of ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED
AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($111,900.00) payable within thirty (30) days following
commencement of the First Renewal Term. Any additional tenant improvements
required by Tenant and approved by Landlord shall be at Tenant's sole cost and
expense.

                 7. Parking. In addition to the existing parking, if additional
parking becomes available during the First Renewal Term, Tenant shall be
provided up to an additional two (2) reserved parking spaces and eight (8)
non-reserved parking spaces at no charge during the First Renewal Term.

                 8. Option to Renew. Article 48 of the Lease is hereby deleted
and the following substituted therefor:

                                      "48.

                                OPTION TO RENEW

                 It Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of its
obligations under this Lease and is not then in default and if Tenant is in
possession of the Premises and has not assigned its rights under this Lease,
Tenant shall have the option of extending the Term of this Lease for two (2)
additional periods of five (5) years each, commencing with the Termination Date
of the First Renewal Term, which options may be exercised only by written notice
by Tenant to Landlord at least six (6) months before the Termination Date of the
First Renewal Term (and the termination date of the first option, respectively).
Tenant's tenancy during the option term shall be at the prevailing market rate
then being charged by Landlord to new occupants of space in the Project (with
consideration being given to any adjustments typically made to such market rate
to reflect the amount of space being leased by Tenant and the then financial
credit-worthiness of Tenant), but otherwise the option term shall be subject to
all of the other terms and provisions of this Lease, including the provisions
for rental adjustment."

                 9. Right of First Refusal. Article 49 of the Lease is hereby
deleted and the following substituted therefor:

                                      "49.

                             RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

                 If Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of its
obligations to be performed prior to the time of any Offer (as defined below)
and is not in default hereunder at the time of any Offer beyond any applicable
grace period, Tenant shall be granted a right of first refusal (the "Right of
First Refusal") to lease all or any portion of that area consisting of
approximately 22,500 contiguous rentable square feet currently leased to CyCare
Systems, should CyCare Systems ever vacate all or any portion of that area (the
"Expansion Space") as shown on

Exhibit "G-1" attached hereto and made a part hereof by this reference, for
occupancy by Tenant on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. Landlord
agrees to notify Tenant, in writing, whenever during the term of this Lease
Landlord receives an offer, which it desires to accept, to lease the Expansion
Space or any portion thereof which notice shall include the terms and conditions
of such offer to lease (the "Offer"). The exercise of any options to renew by
CyCare Systems shall not constitute an Offer.

                 Upon receipt of notification of the Offer, Tenant, at its
option, by written notice to Landlord within five (5) business days thereafter,
may elect to: (a) lease the portion of the Expansion Space described in the
Offer on the same terms and conditions of the Offer, except that Tenant may
require that the lease term for such space be coterminous with the term of this
Lease, in which case the lease of such space is also subject to the conditions
set forth in the second paragraph below; or (b) cancel this Right of First
Refusal to lease the portion of the Expansion Space described in the Offer. If
Tenant does not timely give notice pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, Landlord may rent the portion of the Expansion Space to the third
party described in the Offer upon the terms contained in the Offer. If the third
party described in the Offer does not ultimately rent the Expansion Space
included in the Offer, or if said Third Party eventually quits the Premises,
Tenant's Right of First Refusal shall continue.

                 If the Offer relates to less than all of the Expansion Space,
then, whether or not Tenant elects to lease the portion of the Expansion Space
described in the Offer, the Right of First Refusal shall continue with respect
to the remainder of the Expansion Space which is subject to the Right of First
Refusal at the time Landlord's notification of the Offer is given to Tenant.

                 If pursuant to the provisions of this Article, Tenant leases
all or any portion of the Expansion Space for a term coterminous with the term
of this Lease and if the term of the lease specified in the Offer is shorter
than the remaining term of this Lease, Tenant shall pay rent for such space at
the rate specified in the Offer only for the length of the term specified in the
Offer. Thereafter, Tenant shall pay the greater of the square foot rental rate
provided under the provisions of this Lease (Article 3) or the rental rate
specified in the Offer.

                 In the event Tenant exercises its Right of First Refusal,
Landlord and Tenant shall promptly modify the terms of this Lease to reflect the
inclusion of the Expansion Space leased.

                 10. Right of Second Refusal. A new article, Article 53 is
hereby added to the Lease and shall read as follows:

                                      "53.

                            Right of Second Refusal

                 If Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of its
obligations to be performed prior to the time of any Offer (as defined below)
and is not in default hereunder at the time of any Offer beyond any applicable
grace period, Tenant shall be granted a right of second refusal (the "Right of
Second Refusal") to lease those areas consisting of Suite 1025 (2,826 R.S.F.),
Suite 1027 (1,715 R.S.F.), Suite 1030 (2,261 R.S.F.) and Suite 1034 (3,369
R.S.F.) (the "Second Refusal Space") as shown on Exhibit "H" attached hereto and
made a part hereof by this reference, for occupancy by Tenant on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth. Landlord agrees to notify Tenant, in writing,
whenever during the term of this Lease Landlord receives an offer, which it
desires to accept, to lease the Second Refusal Space or any portion thereof
which notice shall include the terms and conditions of such offer to lease (the
"Offer"). This Right of Second Refusal shall not take effect unless and until
any lease with any existing tenant (including any assignees or sublessee) shall
have expired or be terminated and Landlord has fulfilled any requirements of any
first Rights of Refusal with any other tenant(s). The exercise of any option to
renew by any tenant of any portion of the Second Refusal Space shall not
constitute an Offer.

                 Upon receipt of notification of the Offer, Tenant, at its
option, by written notice to Landlord within two (2) business days thereafter,
may elect to: (a) lease the portion of the Second Refusal Space described in the
Offer on the same terms and conditions of the Offer, or (b) cancel this Right of
Second Refusal to lease the portion of the Second Refusal Space described in the
Offer. If Tenant does not timely give notice pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, Landlord may rent the portion of the Second Refusal Space to
the third party described in the Offer upon the terms contained in the Offer. If
the third party described in the Offer does not ultimately rent the Second
Refusal Space included in the Offer, or if said Third Party eventually quits the
Premises, Tenant's Right of Second Refusal shall continue.

                 If the Offer relates to less than all of the Second Refusal
Space, then, whether or not Tenant elects to lease the portion of the Second
Refusal Space described in the Offer, the Right of Second Refusal shall continue
with respect to the remainder of the Second Refusal Space which is subject to
the Right of Second Refusal at the time Landlord's notification of the Offer is
given to Tenant.

                 In the event Tenant exercises its Right of Second Refusal,
Landlord and Tenant shall promptly modify the terms of this Lease to reflect the
inclusion of the Second Refusal Space leased."

                 11. Option to Expand. A new article, Article 54 is hereby
added to the Lease Agreement and shall read as follows:

                                      "54.

                                Option to Expand

                 If Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of its
obligations to be performed and is not in default hereunder beyond any
applicable grace period, Tenant is granted the right to lease an additional
approximately 1,644 rentable square feet located on the second (2nd) floor of
the Building which is crosshatched on Exhibit "I" attached hereto and made a
part hereof by this reference (the "Expansion Space") to commence May 1, 1996
upon the same terms as provided for in this Third Amendment to Lease for a term
coterminous with the remainder of the First Renewal Term, including any renewal
terms. Tenant shall exercise its option to lease the Expansion Space by giving
Landlord written notice no later than October 15, 1995. In the event Tenant
exercises its right to lease the Expansion Space pursuant to this Article,
Landlord and Tenant shall promptly modify the terms of this Lease to reflect the
lease of the Expansion Space."

                 12. Interpretation. Except as herein specifically modified,
the terms of the Lease Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, so that
the First Renewal Term shall be considered an extension of the Term.

the Modifications.)

     C. Borrower has requested that Bank modify the Loan and the Loan Documents

further amendment confirming such cross default.

     2.2 Each of the Loan Documents is modified to provide that it shall be a
default or an event of default thereunder if Borrower shall fail to comply with

Guarantor(s) is materially incomplete, incorrect, or misleading as of the date
hereof.

(computed on the basis of a 360-day year and applied to the actual number of
days elapsed) which is equal to the sum of the Prime Rate plus one half of one
percent (.5%) per annum. The floating rate of interest will be adjusted as of
the effective date of each change in the Prime Rate.

                        (b)    Interest Payments.  Interest shall be payable
monthly in arrears, on the first (1st) day of each month, commencing with the

outstanding principal amount of all Advances shall bear interest, payable on
demand, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the floating rate described in

set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to limit any of Bank's remedies under

                        (e)    Fees and Expenses.  In addition to all interest

$10,000,000.00 minus (B) the "average monthly outstandings" for the month (or
portion thereof) with respect to which the Unused Commitment Fee is being
computed, with the resulting number multiplied by (C) one-twelfth (1/12th) of
the rate of one-fourth of one percent (.25%) per annum. As used herein, "average
monthly outstandings" means the sum of the outstanding amount of the Advances on
each day during the month (or portion thereof for which the fee is being
computed) with respect to which the Unused Commitment Fee is being computed,
divided by the number of days in that month (or portion thereof). If the Unused
Commitment Fee is being computed for less than a full month, the percentage used
in clause (C) above shall be computed on a daily basis for the number of days
for which the fee is being computed.

                        (b)   Transmittal of Mortgages.   Bank will, upon
request of Borrower, transmit original Mortgage Notes held by Bank in connection

to Borrower or any other Person as to the collection or protection of Collateral
held hereunder or any income thereon, nor as to the preservation of any rights
pertaining thereto, beyond the reasonable care thereof during the time the
Collateral is in the actual possession of Bank. Such care as Bank gives to the
safekeeping of its own property of like kind shall constitute reasonable care of
Collateral when in Bank's actual possession; but Bank is not required to make
presentment, demand or protest, or give notice, and need not take action to
preserve any rights against prior parties, obligors, account debtors, or others,
in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held as Collateral
or in connection with Borrower's obligations. Notwithstanding any provision
hereof or of any Approved Bailee Agreement to the contrary, the transmittal and

which, if unpaid, might become a Lien or charge upon such properties or any part
thereof and which, in each case, may reasonably be expected to result in any
material and adverse change in the business, operations, assets, or financial
condition of Borrower; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to
pay taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies or claims for labor,
materials or supplies for which Borrower shall have obtained an adequate bond or
adequate insurance or which are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings which are being reasonably and diligently pursued.

                  6.11  Payment of Expenses.  Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to
pay any reasonable expenses, charges and levies required to be paid hereunder
(other than such expenses, charges and levies as are being contested in good
faith and by proper proceedings in accordance with Section 6.10 hereof),
notwithstanding that Borrower may not have requested Bank to make such payments,
to the extent that if not paid such expenses, charges and levies could, in
Bank's reasonable opinion, have a material and adverse affect on the Collateral
or on the existence, perfection or priority of Bank's security interest therein.
Bank may make such payments notwithstanding the fact that Borrower is in default
under the terms of this Agreement. Such payments shall be added to the
outstanding principal balance of the Note and shall be due and payable on
demand. The authorization hereby granted shall be irrevocable, and no further
direction or authorization from Borrower shall be necessary for Bank to make
such payments.

                  6.12  Insured Closings.  If available, Borrower shall obtain
and maintain in effect at all times an insured closing letter from each title

and holding Borrower harmless from and against the failure of the agents of such
title insurance companies to comply with the written closing instructions of
Borrower as to the Pledged Mortgages hereunder and will provide Bank with
evidence of the same from time to time upon request. Borrower agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Bank of, from, for and against any loss, claim, or
damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, attributable to the
failure of such title insurance company, agent or approved attorney to comply
with the disbursement or instruction letter or letters of Borrower or Bank
relating to such Mortgage Loan.

credit or agreements with any other lender.

assign, transfer, or otherwise convey or pledge any of its rights under the
Approved Purchase Commitments or the Approved Bailee Agreements, except with the
express written consent of Bank, which consent may be granted or withheld in the
sole and absolute discretion of Bank. Borrower shall comply with all of the
terms and conditions of the Approved Purchase Commitments and the Approved
Bailee Agreements and shall not permit any event to occur or condition to exist
which either immediately or with notice or the lapse of time or both would
permit any party to the Approved Purchase Commitments or the Approved Bailee
Agreements to terminate such Agreements or otherwise not to perform any of their
respective obligations thereunder.

                  6.16  Insurance.  Borrower shall maintain a policy of errors

insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Bank with due regard to generally
accepted mortgage banking practices. Borrower shall also maintain insurance with
respect to the risk of loss of Collateral Documents during the transport thereof
in form and amount and with an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to
Bank.

                  6.17  Special Covenants Concerning Collateral

                        (a)   Ownership; Perfection of Liens.  Borrower warrants
and will defend the right, title and interest of Bank in and to the Pledged
Mortgages against the claims and demands of all persons whomsoever and shall
take all action necessary to assure that Bank has and will at all times have a
valid and perfected first priority security interest in each Pledged Mortgage.

                        (b)   Financing Statements; Further Assurances.
Borrower shall execute and deliver to Bank such Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements with respect to the Collateral as Bank may request.
Borrower also shall execute and deliver to Bank such further instruments of
sale, pledge or assignment or transfer, and such powers of attorney exercisable
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, as
required by Bank, and shall do and perform all matters and things necessary or
desirable to be done or observed, for the purpose of effectively creating,
maintaining and preserving the security and benefits intended to be afforded
Bank under this Agreement. Bank shall have all the rights and remedies of a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Arizona, or any
other applicable law, in addition to all rights provided for herein.

                        (c)   No Amendments.  Borrower shall not amend or
modify, or waive any of the terms and conditions of, or settle or compromise any
claim in respect of, any Pledged Mortgages or Approved Purchase Commitments or
any related rights except upon the written consent of Bank.

                        (d)   No Sale, Assignment or Encumbering.  Borrower
shall not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option
with respect to, or pledge or otherwise encumber (except pursuant to this
Agreement), any of the Collateral or any interest therein other than sales to
Approved Investors pursuant to the Approved Purchase Commitments or as otherwise
permitted hereby.

                  6.18  Collection Rights.  Except as otherwise set forth
herein, and unless any Event of Default has occurred, Borrower shall be entitled
to receive and collect directly all sums payable in respect of the Collateral,
in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided,
however, that all amounts payable by an Approved Investor to purchase a Pledged
Mortgage shall be paid directly to Bank by such Approved Investor. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, Bank shall thereafter be entitled to receive
and collect all sums payable in respect of the Collateral pursuant to Section
7.2(b) of this Agreement.

                  6.19  Appraisals.  Borrower acknowledges that Bank as a
federally regulated institution is required to meet certain regulations
regarding appraisals of loans secured by real estate. Borrower agrees that it
shall be Bank's agent for the purpose of ordering such appraisals and that upon
request, Borrower shall make available to Bank all information regarding such
appraisals, including, without limitation, identification of the appraisers,
copies of all appraisals, copies of all instruction letters regarding such
appraisals, and copies of all other applicable policies and procedures of
Borrower related to obtaining appraisals. In the event Bank shall ever
reasonably determine that appraisals obtained by Borrower are not in compliance
with such regulations or Bank's internal policies, Borrower shall change
Borrower's appraisal policies to Bank's satisfaction.

         VII.     DEFAULTS; REMEDIES

Borrower's or Guarantor's representations or warranties made herein or in any
statement or certificate at any time given by Borrower or Guarantor in writing
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall be false or misleading in any
material respect on the date made or renewed; or

                        (c)   Other Loans.  Failure of Borrower or any Person
that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, Borrower to
pay amounts due Bank in regard to indebtedness heretofore or hereafter issued,
assumed, guaranteed, contracted for or incurred; or

                        (d)   Other Defaults.  Borrower shall default in the
performance of or compliance with any other covenant or other term contained

                        (e)   Adverse Change.  The occurrence of any adverse

or Guarantor  deemed material to Bank; or

                        (f)   Insolvency, etc.  Borrower or Guarantor shall
admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature, or make an
assignment for the benefit of creditors; or Borrower or Guarantor shall apply
for or consent to the appointment of any receiver, trustee or similar officer
for Borrower or Guarantor or for all or substantially all of its property; or
Borrower or Guarantor shall institute (by petition, application, answer, consent
or otherwise) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
readjustment of debts, dissolution, liquidation, or similar proceedings relating
to Borrower or Guarantor under the laws of any jurisdiction; or

                        (g)   Receivership, etc.  A receiver, trustee or similar

and such appointment shall continue undischarged for a period of sixty (60)
days; or any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangements, readjustment
of debt, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceedings shall be instituted (by
petition, application or otherwise) against Borrower or Guarantor without its
consent, and shall remain undismissed for a period of sixty (60) days; or

                        (h)   Judgments.  Any money judgment, writ or warrant of

                        (j)   Challenge to Borrower's Obligations.  Borrower
shall purport to disavow its obligations hereunder or shall contest the validity
or enforceability hereof; or Bank's security interest on any portion of the
Collateral shall become unenforceable or otherwise impaired; provided that,
subject to Bank's approval, no Event of Default shall occur as a result of such
improvement if all Advances made against such Collateral shall be paid in full
within ten (10) days of the date of such impairment; or

                        (k)   Revocation or Suspension of Licenses.  Any

or

                        (l)   Other Default.  An Event of Default shall occur
under any other Loan Document.

                  7.2   Remedies

                        (a)   Acceleration.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, at Bank's option, the unpaid principal amount of and accrued interest
on the Note shall become due and payable automatically, without presentment,
demand or other requirements of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by Borrower.

                        (b)   Other Remedies.  Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default (and in the case of subparagraph (b)(vi) below upon the occurrence of
an Unmatured Event of Default), Bank may also do any of the following:

                              (i)       Enforcement  of Security  Interest.
Foreclose upon or otherwise enforce its security interest in and the Lien on the
Collateral to secure all payments and performance of obligations owed by
Borrower under this Agreement.

                              (ii)      Notification  of  Obligors.   Notify
all obligors and Approved Investors of the Collateral that the Collateral has
been assigned to Bank and that all payments thereon are to be made directly to
Bank or such other party as may be designated by Bank; settle, compromise, or
release, in whole or in part, any amounts owing on the Collateral, or by any
such obligor or Approved Investor on terms acceptable to Bank; enforce payment
and prosecute any action or proceeding with respect to any and all the
Collateral; and where any such Collateral is in default, foreclose on and
enforce security interests in such Collateral by any available judicial process
and sell property acquired as a result of any such foreclosure.

                              (iii)     Servicing.  Act, or contract with a
third party to act, as servicer of each item of Collateral requiring servicing
and perform all obligations required in connection with Purchase Commitments,
such third party's reasonable fees to be
paid by Borrower.

                              (iv)      UCC  Remedies.  Enforce the purchase
obligation of an Approved Investor under the applicable Approved Purchase
Commitment, and exercise all other rights and remedies of a secured creditor
under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Arizona, including but not
limited to selling the Collateral at public or private sale. Bank shall give
Borrower not less than ten (10) days' notice of any such public sale or of the
date after which private sale may be held. Borrower agrees that ten (10) days'
notice shall be reasonable notice. At any such sale the Collateral may be sold
as an entirety or in separate parts, as Bank may determine. Bank may, without
notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to
be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for
the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the same may
be adjourned. In case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit
or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by Bank until the
selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but Bank shall not incur any
liability in case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the
Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again
be sold upon like notice. Bank may, however, instead of exercising the power of
sale herein conferred upon it, proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to
collect all amounts due hereunder or to foreclose the pledge and sell the
Collateral or any portion thereof under a judgment or decree of a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction, or both. Borrower hereby waives any claims it
may have against Bank arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the
Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the price which
might have been obtained at a public sale, or was less than the aggregate amount
of the indebtedness outstanding hereunder.

                              (v)       Direct Action.  Proceed against Borrower
on the Note.

                              (vi)      Suspension of Advances.  Cease making
any further Advances.

                              (vii)     Other  Commitments.  Terminate any
commitments contained in any agreement between Bank and Borrower to make any
further loans or advances.

                              (viii)    Other  Acceleration.  Declare
immediately due and payable any one or more of all other debts or obligations of
Borrower to Bank.

                              (ix)      Other Remedies.  Otherwise exercise its
rights and remedies  available  hereunder or under applicable law.

                              (x)       Rights Under Bailee Agreements.  Enforce
Bank's rights pursuant to any Approved Bailee Agreements to require any Approved
Investors to purchase Mortgage Loans.

                              (xi)      Receiver.  Obtain the appointment of a
receiver of the business and assets of Borrower.

                        (c)   Waivers.  Borrower waives any right to require
Bank to (i) proceed against any Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any of
the Collateral or pursue its rights and remedies as against the Collateral in
any particular order, or (iii) pursue any other remedy in its power.

                        (d)   Protection of Lien.  Bank may, but shall not be
obligated to, advance any sums or do any act or thing necessary to uphold and
enforce the Lien and priority of, or the security intended to be afforded by,
any Mortgage included in the Collateral, including, without limitation, payment
of delinquent taxes or assessments and insurance premiums, to the extent
permitted by such Mortgage. All advances, charges, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by Bank in
exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement, or in the
enforcement hereof, shall become a part of the principal balance outstanding
under the Note and shall accrue interest at the rate or rates specified in the
Note.

                        (e)   No Waivers.  No failure on the part of Bank to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy provided
hereunder, at law or in equity shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise by Bank of any right, power or remedy provided
hereunder, at law or in equity preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided at law or in
equity.

                  7.3   Binding Arbitration.  All controversies and claims of
any nature arising directly or indirectly out of any and all loan transactions
between Borrower and Bank and any related agreements, instruments or documents,
shall at the written request of Borrower or Bank be arbitrated pursuant to the
applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall
occur in the State of Arizona. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The Federal
Arbitration Act shall apply to the construction and interpretation of this
arbitration agreement.

                        (a)   Arbitration Panel.  A single arbitrator shall have
the power to render a maximum award of one hundred thousand dollars. When any
party files a claim in excess of this amount, the arbitration decision shall be
made by the majority vote of three arbitrators. No arbitrator shall have the
power to restrain any act of any party.

                        (b)   Provisional Remedies, Self-Help, and Foreclosure.
No provision of this Section 7.3 shall limit the right of any party to exercise
self-help remedies, to foreclose against any real or personal property
collateral, or to obtain any provisional or ancillary remedies (including but
not limited to injunctive relief or the appointment of a receiver) from a court
of competent jurisdiction. At Bank's option, it may enforce its rights under a
security agreement by private or public sale, a mortgage by judicial
foreclosure, and under a deed of trust either by exercise of power of sale or by
judicial foreclosure. The institution and maintenance of any remedy permitted
above shall not constitute a waiver of the right to submit any controversy or
claim to arbitration. The statute of limitations, estoppel, waiver, laches, and
similar doctrines which would otherwise be applicable in an action brought by a
party shall be applicable in any arbitration proceeding.

                  7.4   Application of Proceeds.  The proceeds of any sale or
other enforcement of Bank's security interest in all or any part of the
Collateral shall be applied by Bank:

                  First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of such sale
or enforcement, including reasonable compensation to Bank's agents and counsel,
and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by or on behalf of
Bank in connection therewith;

                  Second, to the payment of any other amounts due (other than
principal and interest) under the Note or this Agreement;

                  Third, to the payment of interest accrued and unpaid on the
Note;

                  Fourth, to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of
the Note; and

                  Finally, to the payment to Borrower or to its successors or
assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then
remaining from such proceeds.

If the proceeds of any such sale are insufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of such sale, as aforesaid, and the payment in full of the Note and all
other amounts due hereunder, Borrower shall remain liable for any deficiency.

                  7.5   Bank Appointed Attorney-in-Fact.  Bank is hereby
appointed the attorney-in-fact of Borrower, effective from and after the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, with full power
of substitution, for the purpose of executing any instruments and performing
other acts which Bank may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes
hereof, which appointment as attorney-in-fact is irrevocable and coupled with an
interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Bank shall have the
right and power to give notices of its security interest in the Collateral to
any Person, in the name of the holder of the Pledged Mortgages, or to receive,
endorse and collect all checks made payable to the order of Borrower
representing any payment on account of the principal of or interest on, or the
proceeds of sale of, any of the Pledged Mortgages and to give full discharge for
the same.

                  7.6   Right of Set-Off.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Bank shall have the right, at any
time and from time to time, without notice, to set-off and to appropriate or
apply any and all deposits of money or property held by Bank in the name of
Borrower (other than accounts which are held by Borrower in a trust or fiduciary
capacity that is reflected on the books of Bank) or any other indebtedness owing
by Bank to Borrower against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of
Borrower under the Note and this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not Bank
shall have made any demand hereunder and whether or not said obligations and
liabilities shall have matured. Borrower hereby grants to Bank a security
interest in all such deposits or money or property and Bank shall have all
rights of a secured party with respect thereto.

                  IX.   REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNITY

                  Borrower shall:

                        (c)   upon demand, indemnify,  pay and hold harmless

                              (ii)      any suit, claim or demand arising  from

accidental.

(all of the above are collectively the "Indemnified Liabilities").

         X.       MISCELLANEOUS

                  10.1  Terms Binding Upon Successors; Survival of
Representations. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements herein contained on the part of Borrower shall survive the making of
any Advance and the execution of the Note, and shall be effective so long as the
Commitment is outstanding or there remains any obligation of Borrower hereunder
or under the Note to be paid or performed.

                  10.2  Assignment.  This Agreement may not be assigned by
Borrower. This Agreement and the Note, along with Bank's security interest in
any or all of the Collateral, may, at any time, be transferred or assigned, in
whole or in part, by Bank, and any assignee thereof may enforce this Agreement,
the Note and such interest. Bank shall use its reasonable efforts to provide
Borrower with notice of any such transfer or assignment; provided, however, that
Bank's failure to provide such notice shall not in any way invalidate such
transfer or assignment or otherwise constitute a breach by Bank of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, and any payments made or performance
rendered by Borrower to Bank prior to Borrower's receipt of such notice shall be
deemed to have been duly made or rendered under this Agreement.

                  10.3  Participation.  Borrower agrees that Bank may enter
into agreements with other financial institutions to participate in this credit
accommodation. Borrower agrees to execute all documents and instruments
reasonably requested by Bank in order to facilitate said participation.

                  10.4  Amendments.   This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented except in a writing signed by the parties hereto.

                  10.5  Governing Law.  This Agreement and the Note shall be
governed and construed by the laws of the State of Arizona.

                  10.6  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the documents
referred to in this Agreement represent the entire agreement between, and
reflect the reasonable expectations of, Borrower and Bank with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

                  10.7  Savings Clause.  This Agreement and all of the other
Credit Agreement Documents are intended to be performed in accordance with, and
only to the extent permitted by, all applicable usury laws. If any provision
hereof or of any of the other Credit Agreement Documents or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances shall, for any reason and to any extent,
be invalid or unenforceable, neither the application of such provision to any
other person or circumstance nor the remainder of the instrument in which such
provision is contained shall be affected thereby and shall be enforced to the
greatest extent permitted by law. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be
the intent of the holder hereof to at all times comply with the usury and other
applicable laws now or hereafter governing the interest payable on the
indebtedness evidenced by the Note. If the applicable law is ever revised,
repealed or judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called
for under the Note, this Agreement, or under any of the other Credit Agreement
Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect
to the indebtedness evidenced by the Note, or if Bank's exercise of the option
to accelerate the maturity of the Note, or if any prepayment by Borrower results
in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by law, then it
is the express intent of Borrower and Bank that all excess amounts theretofore
collected by Bank be credited on the principal balance of the Note (or, if the
Note and all other indebtedness arising under or pursuant to the other Credit
Agreement Documents have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the
provisions of the Note and the other Credit Agreement Documents immediately be
deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectable hereunder and thereunder
reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to
comply with the then applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the
fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder or thereunder. All sums paid, or
agreed to be paid, by Borrower for the use, forbearance, detention, taking,
charging, receiving or reserving of the indebtedness of Borrower to Bank under
the Note or arising under or pursuant to the other Credit Agreement Documents
shall, to the maximum extend permitted by applicable law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness
until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such
indebtedness does not exceed the usury ceiling from time to time in effect and
applicable to such indebtedness for so long as such indebtedness is outstanding.
To the extent federal law permits Bank to contract for, charge or receive a
greater amount of interest, Bank will rely on federal law, for the purpose of
determining the Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or in any of the other Credit Agreement Documents, it is not the
intention of Bank to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not
accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the
time of such acceleration.

         If the laws of the State of Texas are ever deemed to govern this
Agreement or the Note notwithstanding the parties expressed intent to the
contrary, the parties agree that TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 5069 Ch. 15
(which regulates certain revolving loan accounts and revolving tri-party
accounts) shall in no event apply to this Agreement or the Note. Further, to the
extent that TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art 5069-1.04, as amended, is applicable
to the Note or this Agreement, the "indicated rate ceiling" specified in such
article is the applicable ceiling; provided that, if any law permits greater
interest, the law permitting the greatest interest shall apply.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed as of the date set forth above.

                                   BORROWER:

                            FORM OF PROMISSORY NOTE

                            REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT

                                PROMISSORY NOTE



                                                                Phoenix, Arizona
$10,000,000.00                                                      May 27, 1994


1.       PROMISE TO PAY.

         For value received, MILTEX MORTGAGE OF TEXAS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a
         Texas limited partnership dba Miltex Mortgage Company ("Maker"),
         promises to pay to the order of BANK ONE, ARIZONA, NA at its office at
         241 North Central Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85004, or at such other
         place as the holder hereof may from time to time designate in writing,
         the principal sum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or so much
         thereof as shall from time to time be disbursed and outstanding under
         that certain Mortgage Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement (as it
         may be amended, modified, extended, and renewed and replaced from time
         to time, the "Credit Agreement") of even date herewith between Maker
         and the payee named above, together with accrued interest from the date
         of disbursement on the unpaid principal at the applicable rate as set
         forth in Section 4. The payee named above shall have no obligation to
         make any Advances hereunder except in accordance with the Credit
         Agreement. This note (as it may be amended, modified, extended, and
         renewed from time to time, the "Note") is issued pursuant to, entitled
         to the benefits of, and referred to as the "Note" in the Credit
         Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
         this Note and the provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Credit
         Agreement shall control. Capitalized terms used herein without
         definition shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.

2.       MATURITY DATE.

         Absent the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder or under any of
         the Credit Agreement, this Note, and other documents evidencing or
         securing the loans contemplated by the Credit Agreement (collectively
         the "Credit Agreement Documents"), the unpaid principal balance hereof,
         together with all unpaid interest accrued thereon, and all other
         amounts payable by Maker under the terms of the Credit Agreement
         Documents, shall be due and payable on May 25, 1995 (the "Maturity
         Date"). If the Maturity Date should fall (whether by acceleration or
         otherwise) on a day that is not a Business Day, payment of the
         outstanding principal shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day
         and such extension of time shall be included in computing the interest
         included in such payment.

3.       PREPAYMENT.

         Maker may prepay the unpaid principal balance, in whole or in part, at
         any time without penalty or premium. Amounts prepaid may be reborrowed
         in accordance with the Credit Agreement.

4.       PAYMENTS.

         (a)      Absent an Event of Default hereunder or under any of the
                  Credit Agreement Documents, each Advance made hereunder shall
                  bear interest at a floating rate of interest equal to the sum
                  of the Prime Rate plus one-half of one percent (.5%) per
                  annum; provided, however, that if at any time the contract
                  rate shall exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the
                  interest on this Note to be limited to the Maximum Rate, then
                  any subsequent reduction in the contract rate shall not reduce
                  the rate of interest on this Note below the Maximum Rate until
                  the total amount of interest accrued on this Note equals the
                  amount of interest which would have accrued on this Note if
                  the contract rate had at all times been in effect. Throughout
                  the term of this Note, interest shall be calculated on a
                  360-day year with respect to the unpaid balance of any Advance
                  and, in all cases, shall be computed for the actual number of
                  days in the period for which interest is charged. The floating
                  rate of interest will be adjusted as of the effective date of
                  each change in the Prime Rate.

                  The term "Maximum Rate," as used herein, shall mean at the
                  particular time in question the maximum rate of interest
                  which, under applicable law, may then be charged on this Note.
                  If such maximum rate of interest changes after the date hereof
                  and this Note provides for a fluctuating rate of interest, the
                  Maximum Rate shall be automatically increased or deceased, as
                  the case may be, without notice to Borrower from time to time
                  as of the effective date of each change in such maximum rate.

         (b)      All payments of principal and interest due hereunder shall
                  be made (i) without deduction of any present and future taxes,
                  levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, which
                  amounts shall be paid by Maker, and (ii) without any other set
                  off.

         (c)      Interest hereunder shall be payable by Maker to the holder
                  hereof on the first (1st) day of each and every month during
                  the term of this Note commencing with the first (1st) day of
                  the first month following the date hereof. If any payment of
                  interest to be made by Maker hereunder shall become due on a
                  day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
                  the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time
                  shall be included in computing the interest in such payment.

         (d)      Payments of principal shall be due as provided in the Credit
                  Agreement.

5.       LAWFUL MONEY.

         Principal and interest are payable in lawful money of the United States
         of America.

6.       APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS/LATE CHARGE.

         (a)      Absent the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder or
                  under any of the other Credit Agreement Documents, any
                  payments received by the holder hereof pursuant to the terms
                  hereof shall be applied in the manner set forth in the Credit
                  Agreement or, if not so set forth, in such order as the holder
                  hereof may, in its sole discretion, elect. Any payments
                  received by the holder hereof after the occurrence of an Event
                  of Default hereunder or under any of the Credit Agreement
                  Documents shall be applied in such order as the holder hereof
                  may, in its sole discretion, elect.

         (b)      If any payment of interest is not received by the holder
                  hereof within fifteen (15) days of the due date thereof, then
                  in addition to the remedies conferred upon the holder pursuant
                  to Section 9 hereof and the other Credit Agreement Documents,
                  a late charge of four percent (4%) of the amount due and
                  unpaid will be added to the delinquent amount to compensate
                  the holder hereof for the expense of handling the delinquency
                  for such payment; provided, however, that the obligation to
                  pay a late charge shall be subject to the provisions hereof
                  limiting the charging, collection, and receipt of interest to
                  the Maximum Rate.

7.       SECURITY.

         This Note is secured by and is entitled to the benefits of the Credit
         Agreement. The provisions of the Credit Agreement are incorporated
         herein by reference as if set forth in full, and this Note is subject
         to all of the covenants and conditions contained in the Credit
         Agreement. This Note is guaranteed by the Guaranty.

8.       EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         The occurrence of any of the following shall be deemed to be an event
         of default ("Event of Default") hereunder:

         (a)     Failure to Pay.  Failure of Maker to make a payment of
                 principal or interest within fifteen (15) days of the due date
                 thereof or failure of Maker to make any other payment or
                 perform any obligation hereunder; or

         (b)     The occurrence of an Event of Default under any of the other
                 Credit Agreement Documents.

9.       REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the entire balance of
         principal together with all accrued interest thereon, and all other
         amounts payable by Maker under the Credit Agreement Documents shall, at
         the option of the holder hereof and without demand or notice,
         immediately become due and payable. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
         Default (and so long as such Event of Default shall continue), the
         entire balance of principal hereof, together with all accrued interest
         thereon, all other amounts due under the Credit Agreement Documents,
         and any judgment for such principal, interest, and other amounts, at
         the option of the holder hereof, shall bear interest equal to the
         lesser of (i) the Default Rate; or (ii) the Maximum Rate. No delay or
         omission on the part of the holder hereof in exercising any right under
         this Note or under any of the other Credit Agreement Documents hereof
         shall operate as a waiver of such right. The remedies of the holder
         hereof, as provided in this Note and in the Credit Agreement or any
         other instrument securing this Note, shall be cumulative and
         concurrent, and may be pursued singularly, successively or together, at
         the sole discretion of the holder hereof, and may be exercised as often
         as occasion therefor shall arise.

10.      WAIVER.

         Maker, endorsers, guarantors, and sureties of this Note hereby waive
         diligence, demand for payment, presentment for payment, protest, notice
         of nonpayment, notice of protest, notice of intent to accelerate,
         notice of acceleration, notice of dishonor, and notice of nonpayment,
         and all other notices or demands of any kind and expressly agree that,
         without in any way affecting the liability of Maker, endorsers,
         guarantors, or sureties, the holder hereof may extend any maturity date
         or the time for payment of any installment due hereunder, otherwise
         modify the Credit Agreement Documents, accept additional security,

         of the change, discharge, termination, or waiver is sought. No failure
         on the part of the holder hereof to exercise and no delay by the holder
         hereof in exercising any right or remedy under this Note or under the
         law shall operate as a waiver thereof.

         with the Credit Agreement, including without limitation, any fees to be

17.      CHOICE OF LAW.

         This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
         laws of the State of Arizona, without giving effect to conflict of laws
         principles.

18.      INTEGRATION.

         The Credit Agreement Documents contain the complete understanding and
         agreement of the holder hereof and Maker and supersede all prior
         representations, warranties, agreements, arrangements, understandings,

19.      BINDING EFFECT.

         The Credit Agreement Documents will be binding upon, and inure to the
         benefit of, the holder hereof, Maker, and their respective successors
         and assigns. Maker may not delegate its obligations under the Credit
         Agreement Documents.

20.      TIME OF THE ESSENCE.

         Time is of the essence with regard to each provision of the Credit
         Agreement Documents as to which time is a factor.

21.      RELATIONSHIP.

         The relationship of the parties hereto is that of borrower and lender
         and it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing contained in
         this Note or in the Credit Agreement shall be interpreted or construed
         to make Maker and Payee partners, joint venturers or participants in
         any other legal relationship except for borrower and lender.

22.      SAVINGS CLAUSE.

         This Note and all of the other Credit Agreement Documents are intended
         to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted
         by, all applicable usury laws. If any provision hereof or of any of the
         other Credit Agreement Documents or the application thereof to any
         person or circumstance shall, for any reason and to any extent, be
         invalid or unenforceable, neither the application of such provision to
         any other person or circumstance nor the remainder of the instrument in
         which such provision is contained shall be affected thereby and shall
         be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law. It is expressly
         stipulated and agreed to be the intent of the holder hereof to at all
         times comply with the usury and other applicable laws now or hereafter
         governing the interest payable on the indebtedness evidenced by this
         Note. If the applicable law is ever revised, repealed or judicially
         interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this
         Note or under any of the other Credit Agreement Documents, or
         contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to
         the indebtedness evidence by this Note, or if Holder's exercise of the
         option to accelerate the maturity of this Note, or if any prepayment by
         Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that
         permitted by law, then it is the express intent of Borrower and Holder
         that all excess amount theretofore collected by Holder be credited on
         the principal balance of this Note (or, if this Note and all other
         indebtedness arising under or pursuant to the other Credit Agreement
         Documents have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the
         provisions of this Note and the other Credit Agreement Documents
         immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectable
         hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the
         execution of any new document, so as to comply with the then applicable
         law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise
         called for hereunder or thereunder. All sums paid, or agreed to be
         paid, by Borrower for the use, forbearance, detention, taking,
         charging, receiving or reserving of the indebtedness of Borrower to
         Holder under this Note or arising under or pursuant to the other Credit
         Agreement Documents shall, to the maximum extent permitted by
         applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout
         the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the
         rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not
         exceed the usury ceiling from time to time in effect and applicable to
         such indebtedness for so long as such indebtedness is outstanding. To
         the extent federal law permits Holder to contract for, charge or
         receive a greater amount of interest, Holder will rely on federal law,
         for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Credit
         Agreement Documents, it is not the intention of Holder to accelerate
         the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such
         acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such
         acceleration.

         If the laws of the State of Texas are ever deemed to govern this Note
         notwithstanding the parties' expressed intent to the contrary,
         the parties  agree that TEX.  REV. CIV.  STAT.  ANN. art 5069 Ch. 15
         (which  regulated certain revolving loan accounts and revolving
         tri-party  accounts) shall in no event apply to this Note.  Further, to
         the extent that TEX. REV.  CIV. STAT.  ANN. art 5069-1.04, as amended,
         is applicable to this Note, the "indicated  rate ceiling" specified in
         such article is the applicable ceiling;  provided that, if any
         applicable law permits greater interest,  the law permitting the
         greatest interest shall apply.

23.      NOTICES.

         Notices under this Note will be given in the manner set forth in the
         Credit Agreement.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
                                  CONDITION
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


  Homebuilding

    The Phoenix area accounted for approximately 58%, 86% and 87% of the
Company's revenues from home sales in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, unit
activity, average sales price and revenue from home sales for the Company:


                                                Years ended May 31,
                                      ----------------------------------------
                                          1994          1993          1992
                                      ------------  ------------  ------------
Units delivered......................        2,831         1,769         1,470
Average sales price..................     $120,110      $113,065      $112,119
Revenue from home sales (000's)......     $340,031      $200,012      $164,815
Percentage increase from prior year..        70.0%         21.4%
Change due to volume.................        60.0%         20.4%
Change due to average sales price....        10.0%          1.0%

    The increase in volume in fiscal 1994 was attributable to the Texas
operations, improved housing markets in the Phoenix and Denver areas and
increased deliveries in California as a result of the Company's aggressive
marketing in that location.  The increase in volume in fiscal 1993 was
attributable primarily to the improved housing markets in the Phoenix and
Denver areas.  Single family housing starts increased by more than 23% and 34%
in calendar 1993 and 1992, respectively, compared to 1992 and 1991 in the
Phoenix area and by more than 20% and 50% in the same time periods in the
Denver area.  The increase in average sales price in fiscal 1994 was primarily
due to the increased number of deliveries in California, most of which were in
the move-up market.  The fiscal 1994 results include an aggregate of 810
deliveries from the Texas operations with an average sales price of $107,100
per home, resulting in incremental revenue of $86,776,000.

    Revenues from land sales were $1,095,000 in fiscal 1994, $4,113,000 in
fiscal 1993 and $3,114,000 in fiscal 1992.  Land sales revenue in fiscal 1993
was primarily the result of the sale of an undeveloped 11.5 acre commercial
site in Phoenix.  Substantially all of the fiscal 1992 land sales were
effected as part of the series of transactions in which the Company sold
developed lots to unrelated third parties and retained an option to buy the
lots back at fixed prices within specified periods of time.

    The increases in backlog in fiscal 1994 and 1993 in Denver and fiscal 1993
in Phoenix were due to the improved housing markets in both locations, which
the Company believes resulted primarily from improved economic conditions in
these markets and lower mortgage interest rates. Significant volume increases
in earlier quarters resulted in the Company selling out of several
subdivisions in Phoenix faster than anticipated. This resulted in fewer homes
available for sale in Phoenix in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of
fiscal 1994 compared to the same periods in fiscal 1993. As a result of this
inventory shortage, the number of units in the backlog in Phoenix at May 31,
1994 was 16% less than the prior year. New subdivisions opened in late May and
early June increased the number of active subdivisions in Phoenix to a level
consistent with prior years. The aggregate sales value of new contracts signed
increased 54% in fiscal 1994 as a result of the Texas operations to
$351,536,000 representing 2,844 homes (including $101,094,000 in Texas
representing 935 homes) as compared with $228,338,000 representing 2,000 homes
in fiscal 1993.

</TABLE>

    Gross profit from home sales was 18.3% (20.5%, excluding California
operations) in fiscal 1994 compared to 19.0% (20.7% excluding California
operations) in fiscal 1993.  The Southern California market has been weak due
to difficult economic conditions, concerns about home values and low consumer
confidence.  Accordingly, the Company has aggressively marketed its California
homes by offering sales incentives and discounts.  During fiscal 1995 the
Company anticipates bringing to the market three new neighborhoods. These new
neighborhoods will generate a significant improvement in the Southern
California gross profit margins. The California market, however, will continue
to have a negative impact on the Company's earnings since current volume is
not sufficient to offset general and administrative expenses and interest
which is expensed and not capitalized.

    The increase in total SG&A expenses for fiscal 1994 was due to higher
variable marketing costs (primarily sales commissions and model furniture
amortization) due to the increase in the number of homes delivered, higher
salaries and higher customer service costs.  In addition, the current fiscal
year included $11,125,000 of SG&A expenses from Texas and $669,000 related to
the amortization of the excess of cost over related net assets acquired. The
increase in total SG&A expenses in fiscal 1993 was primarily due to higher
variable marketing costs (primarily sales commissions) due to the increase in
the number of homes delivered, higher salaries, higher customer service costs
and higher employee benefits (including the adoption of the executive split
dollar life insurance program).  Additionally, SG&A increased in fiscal 1993
due to expenses related to the California office which was opened in the
second quarter of fiscal 1992.  SG&A expenses for each home delivered were
$13,092, $11,778 and $12,685 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
Company capitalizes certain SG&A expenses for homebuilding. Accordingly, total
SG&A expenses incurred for homebuilding were $42,040,000, $24,005,000 and
$21,341,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    The Company capitalizes certain interest costs for its homebuilding
operations and includes such capitalized interest in cost of home sales when
the related units are delivered. Accordingly, total interest incurred by the
Company was $13,378,000, $11,896,000 and $9,366,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively. Interest, net for homebuilding was $4,456,000, $5,498,000
and $1,341,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The increase in
interest expense in fiscal 1993 was primarily the result of the Company
expensing interest related to its Carlsbad, California project and an increase
in  debt outstanding due to the issuance of the 12% Senior Notes in August
1992. The Company capitalized $1,816,000 of interest relating to the Carlsbad,
California project in fiscal 1992.  The  Company discontinued capitalizing
interest on this project in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992 and will
continue to expense such interest until development commences on this project.

    The Company's pre-tax profit from homebuilding for fiscal 1994 was
$20,632,000 compared to $11,718,000 for the year ended May 31, 1993 and
$9,685,000 for the year ended May 31, 1992. The increase in pre-tax profit was
primarily due to greater deliveries in Phoenix and, in fiscal 1994, inclusion
of the Texas results (which contributed $4,406,000 of pre-tax profit).

    The Company owns 417 acres in Carlsbad, California, located in San Diego
County.  When developed, the property is expected to consist of approximately
780 single family lots. The acquisition loan on the Carlsbad property was made
by a thrift that is now under the control of the Resolution Trust Corporation
("RTC") and had a maturity date of June 19, 1992. The loan balance at maturity
would have been approximately $24,500,000. The loan was repaid in April 1992
for $16,000,000. Thereafter, the Company re-evaluated the net realizable value
of the Carlsbad property and determined that an inventory writedown before
taxes of $7,500,000 should be recorded against the property. This writedown
was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992.

  Mortgage Banking

    The Company's mortgage banking operations are conducted through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries American Western Mortgage Company ("AWMC") in
Arizona and Miltex Management, Inc. ("MMI") in Texas. The following table
summarizes operating information for the Company's mortgage banking
operations:

    Revenues and general and administrative  expense from mortgage banking
operations increased in fiscal 1994 primarily due to the Texas operations.
Included in fiscal 1994 results are 1,438 loan originations and $3,259,000 and
$917,000 of revenues and operating income, respectively, from MMI.  Revenues
from mortgage banking operations increased in fiscal 1993 due to an increase
in revenue from loan servicing and the sale of approximately $15,065,000 in
servicing rights from the servicing portfolio which resulted in a gain of
approximately $200,000.  The Company retains a portion of the loan servicing
and, at May 31, 1994, the servicing portfolio was approximately $61,864,000
compared to $52,986,000 at May 31, 1993.  In 1990, after the failure of a
number of local thrifts and the resulting reduction of available permanent
financing in the Phoenix area, the Company began offering mortgage-related
services to customers other than its homebuyers. The decrease in general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 1993 is a result of such originations and
the related personnel being eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992.

  Consolidated Operations

    Net income was $13,083,000 ($2.11 per share, $1.88 fully diluted) in
fiscal 1994 compared to $7,100,000 ($1.38 per share, $1.30 fully diluted) and
$6,591,000 ($1.39 per share, $1.34 fully diluted) in fiscal 1993 and 1992,
respectively. During fiscal 1992, the Company retired a subordinated note and
the note payable related to  the Carlsbad property, both of which were payable
to the RTC, at an amount less than par.  These payoffs resulted in a gain of
$5,299,000 net of income taxes. The gain has been reflected as an
extraordinary item in the Company's 1992 Consolidated Statement of Income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


    The Company's financing needs depend primarily upon sales volume, asset
turnover, land acquisition and inventory balances.  The Company has financed,
and expects to continue to finance, its working capital needs through funds
generated by operations and borrowings.  Funds for future land acquisitions
and construction costs are expected to be provided primarily by cash flows
from operations and future borrowings as permitted under the 12%  Senior Note
Indenture. At May 31, 1994, the Company had unsecured lines of credit from two
lenders for aggregate borrowings (excluding mortgage warehouse lines) of up to
$15,000,000. In connection with the Milburn Acquisition, the Company assumed a
$25,000,000 secured revolving line of credit.  At May 31, 1994 there were no
amounts outstanding under its credit lines.  The Company's revolving lines of
credit bear interest at rates ranging from prime plus 1/2% to prime plus 1%.
The Company believes that amounts generated from operations and such
additional borrowings will provide funds adequate to finance its homebuilding
activities and meet its debt service requirements. The Company does not have
any current commitments for capital expenditures.

    AWMC has a warehouse line of credit for $15,000,000 which is guaranteed by
the Company.  In addition, MMI has a warehouse line of credit for $10,000,000.
Pursuant to the warehouse lines of credit, the Company issues drafts to  fund
its  mortgage loans. The amount represented by a draft is drawn on the
warehouse line of credit when the draft is presented for payment.  At May 31,
1994, no amounts were outstanding under the warehouse lines of credit and the
amount of funding drafts outstanding was $3,439,000.  The Company believes
that such line is sufficient for its mortgage banking operations.

    On July 29, 1993 the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of  Milburn for approximately $26.2 million ($20 million in cash and $6.2
million of Series A Preferred Stock). On January 28, 1994, the  Company
acquired the operations of Aspen Homes for total cash consideration of
$6,982,000.

    In November 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 1,704,400
shares of common stock at $21.50 per share.  The net proceeds of the offering
(approximately  $34,228,000) were used to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock
and to reduce temporarily all amounts outstanding under the Company's
revolving lines of credit and mortgage banking warehouse lines of credit.

    On March 22, 1994, the Company obtained the consent of the holders of the
majority of the outstanding 12% Senior Notes to certain amendments to the
Indenture, including to permit the sale of an additional $35,000,000 of Senior
Notes.  In connection therewith, the Company paid $1,102,020 to the holders of
the outstanding Notes.  On March 31, 1994, the Company completed the sale of
the additional Senior Notes at 107% of par.

  Inflation and Effects of Changing Prices

    Real estate and residential housing prices are affected by inflation,
which can cause increases in the prices of land, raw materials and
subcontracted labor.  In the past three years, the Company has not experienced
any significant inflationary pressure on land, raw materials or labor.  Unless
costs are recovered through higher sales prices, gross profit margins will
decrease.  As interest rates increase, construction and financing costs as
well as the cost of borrowing funds also increase, which can result in lower
gross profits. Relatively low interest rates during fiscal 1994 have made the
Company's homes more affordable in each of its markets.  High mortgage
interest rates make it more difficult for the Company's customers to qualify
for home mortgage loans.  These factors have a much more significant effect on
the Company's operations than does seasonality, in part because homes can be
constructed year-round.

statement  presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    The following accounting policies, together with  those disclosed
elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements, represent the significant
accounting policies followed by Continental Homes Holding Corp. (the
"Company") and its subsidiaries.

  Principles of Consolidation

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant
intercompany balances and  transactions.  The Company's investments in joint
ventures in which it had a 50% or less equity interest were accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. See Note D.

  Income Taxes

    The Company adopted the accounting for income taxes prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109  "Accounting for Income
Taxes" ("FAS  109") during the year ended May  31, 1992. The adoption of FAS
109 was not material to the financial statements. Among other things, FAS 109
requires the adoption of the liability method and further requires that
current and deferred tax balances be determined based on tax rates and laws
enacted as of the balance sheet date rather than the historical tax rates. See
Note G.

  Homes, Lots and Improvements in Production

    Homes, lots and improvements in production are stated at the lower of
accumulated cost or market.  Interest  costs incurred during construction or
development activities related to homes, lots and improvements in production
and certain indirect project costs (employee   related   costs)   are
capitalized and subsequently charged to cost of home sales as the units
associated with such costs are sold. See Note C.

    The  components of homes, lots and improvements in production areas
follows:
                                                          May 31,

                                                 ============  ============


  Property and Equipment

    Property and equipment is stated at cost and consists primarily of office
furniture and equipment. Depreciation expense is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (three to five years).
Depreciation expense was $472,000, $334,000 and $310,000 in 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively. The costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred.

  Excess of Cost over Related Net Assets Acquired

    The excess of cost over related net assets acquired of $10,217,000 is
being amortized over periods ranging from three to twenty years using the
straight- line  method.  Amortization expense was $856,000, $187,000 and
$187,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

    The carrying amounts of cash, receivables and trade payables approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.  The
fair value of the Company's senior and subordinated debt is estimated based on
quoted market prices.  At May 31, 1994 and 1993, the estimated fair value of
the Company's senior and subordinated debt was $143,550,000 and $111,912,500,
respectively.

    Mortgage loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or market
which approximates the fair value.  The mortgage banking notes payable bear
interest at a rate indexed to the prime rate, therefore, the carrying amounts
of the outstanding borrowings at May 31, 1994 approximate fair value. The
carrying amounts of mortgage loans held for long-term investment and
mortgage-backed bonds approximate fair value.

    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgement, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect estimates.

  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115

    The Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
115, "Accounting for Certain Investments  in  Debt and Equity  Securities"
effective June 1, 1994.  This change in accounting is not expected to have a
material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

  Sales Recognition

    The Company recognizes income from home and land sales in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 66.  The Company includes the
discounts incurred in obtaining permanent financing for its customers in  cost
of home sales. Substantially all of the 1992 land sales were effected as part
of a series of transactions in which the Company sold land to a third party
and retained an option to buy it back within specified periods of time.

  Mortgage Banking Fee Recognition

    Loan origination fees are recognized as income in accordance with
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 65 and No. 91.

  Interest, Net

    Interest, net is comprised of interest expense and interest income.  The
summary of the components of interest, net is as follows:

  Earnings Per Common Share

    Earnings  per common share has been computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Earnings per common
share assuming full dilution has been computed assuming the conversion of the
Convertible Subordinated Notes issued in March 1992.

B. RECEIVABLES

    Notes  and accounts receivable are as follows:

C. INTEREST CAPITALIZATION

    The Company follows the practice of capitalizing for its homebuilding
operations certain interest costs incurred on land under development and homes
under construction.  Such capitalized interest is included in cost of home
sales when the units are delivered.  The Company capitalized interest in the
amount of $8,654,000, $6,034,000 and $7,150,000 and expensed as a component of
cost of home sales $7,734,000, $6,236,000 and $4,930,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively. Included in interest capitalized as of May 31, 1992
was $5,003,000 related to the Carlsbad, California property. This capitalized
interest was expensed as a component of the $7,500,000 inventory writedown in
1992.

D. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES

    The Company currently accounts for its California operations on a
consolidated basis.  The various California joint ventures were terminated

    Mortgage loans held for long term investment and the related bonds payable
are the result of the Company's mortgage banking subsidiaries selling a
portion of the mortgages they originated to related financing subsidiaries.
Bonds issued by the Company's financing subsidiaries are secured by GNMA
certificates and first mortgage loans.  Payments are made on the bonds on a
periodic basis as a result of, and in amounts related to, corresponding
payments received on the underlying mortgage collateral.  All principal and
interest on the collateral is remitted directly to a trustee and is available
for payment on the bonds.  Neither the Company nor its mortgage banking
subsidiaries have guaranteed or otherwise are obligated with respect to these
bond issues.

    At May 31, 1994, the Company had available unsecured bank lines of credit
for borrowings (excluding mortgage warehouse lines) of $15,000,000.  In
connection with the Milburn Acquisition, the Company assumed a $25,000,000
secured revolving line of credit. Interest rates range from prime + 1/2% to
prime + 1%.  The unsecured bank lines of credit mature through October 1995.
The secured bank line of credit matures in July 1995. At May 31, 1994, the
Company had no amounts outstanding under the lines of credit.  During fiscal
1994, the weighted average interest rate on the average month end balance was
6.9%. The average month end outstanding balance during the year was $5,464,000
and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $20,416,000. The
Company is required to maintain $750,000 of compensating balance deposits with
the lenders, minimum levels of liquidity and tangible net worth and maximum
levels of debt to net worth in conjunction with these unsecured lines of
credit.

    In August 1992, the Company issued $75,000,000 principal amount of 12%
Senior Notes due August 1, 1999. The Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or
in part at the option of the Company at any time on or after August 1, 1997 at
redemption prices decreasing from 104%. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of the Company.

    On March 22, 1994, the Company obtained the consent of the holders of the
majority of the outstanding 12% Senior Notes to certain amendments to the
indenture, including to permit the sale of an additional $35,000,000 of Senior
Notes.  On March 31, 1994, the Company completed the sale of the additional
Senior Notes.

    The indenture relating to the Company's 12% Senior Notes contains certain
covenants which among other things, limit the amount of additional debt which
may be incurred, the making of restricted payments (as defined), including the
payment of dividends, and the ability to create certain liens, enter into
certain transactions with affiliates or merge, consolidate, transfer or sell
substantially all assets.  As of May 31, 1994, approximately $24,419,000 was
available for making restricted payments. The indenture requires the Company
to maintain a net worth (as defined) of not less than $20,300,000. In the
event of a change in control, the Company will be required, subject to certain
conditions and limitations, to offer to purchase all Senior Notes then
outstanding at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.

    In March 1992, the Company issued $35,000,000 principal amount of 67/8%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2002.  The Notes are convertible
at a rate of 42.55 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes
at any time prior to maturity. The Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at
the option of the Company at any time on or after March 18, 1995 at redemption
prices increasing from 95%.  The Notes are subordinated to all senior
indebtedness of the Company.

H. STOCK OPTIONS

    The Company has two stock incentive plans (the "Plans").  The 1988 Stock
Incentive Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on July 29, 1988 and the
stockholders on August 26, 1988 and amended by the Board of Directors on July
23, 1992 and the stockholders on August 26, 1992. The 1986 Stock Incentive
Plan was approved by the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the
Company on July 26, 1986.  The Plans are intended to provide an incentive to
officers and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to remain with
the Company.  The Board of Directors has authorized the reservation of 700,000
shares of the Company's common stock for issuance under the Plans.  Options
may be granted at a price equal to the market value on the date of the grant
(or 85% of market value in the case of non-qualified options) and may not be
exercised for one year (six months in the case of nonqualified options) from
the date of grant.  Under the Plans, options must be exercised within 10 years
(5 years for a 10% holder) from the date the option was granted.

    The following summarizes the stock option transactions for the two years
ended May 31, 1994:

K. ACQUISITION OF MILBURN INVESTMENTS, INC.

    On July 29, 1993, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the
Common Stock of Milburn Investments, Inc. ("Milburn") for approximately $26.2
million.  The consideration consisted of approximately $20 million in cash and
$6.2 million in Series A Preferred Stock issued by the Company.  On November
4, 1993 the Company redeemed the Series A Preferred Stock.  Milburn is the
leading builder of single-family homes in the Austin, Texas metropolitan area.
The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method with the results of
operations of Milburn included for the ten month period beginning August 1,
1993.  The excess of cost over related net assets acquired of $4,788,000 is
being amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years using the straight
line method.

    The following unaudited pro forma combined financial data give effect to
the acquisition as if it had occurred on the first day of each period.  This
pro forma information has been prepared utilizing the historical consolidated
financial statements of the Company and Milburn. The pro forma financial data
is provided for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be
indicative of the results which would have been obtained if the acquisition
had been effected during the periods presented. The pro forma financial
information is based on the purchase method of accounting and reflects
adjustments to record the profit of acquired inventories, amortize the
non-compete agreement and the excess purchase price over the underlying value
of net assets acquired, reflect the additional interest on acquisition
indebtedness assumed and adjust income taxes for the pro forma adjustments.
