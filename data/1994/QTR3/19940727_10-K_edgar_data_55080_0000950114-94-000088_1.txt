$434,173,000.

ITEM 1.      BUSINESS

       (a)  Kellwood Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company")
manufacture and market apparel and related soft goods.  Kellwood
Company was founded in 1961 as the successor by merger of fifteen
independent suppliers to Sears.

            During the second half of the 1980's, the Company
implemented a business strategy to expand its branded label
products, broaden its customer base, increase its channels of
distribution and further develop its global product sourcing
capability.  Since 1985, Kellwood has acquired the following 12
domestic companies.

     (1)     Subsequent to acquisition, these companies were
             liquidated and consolidated into Kellwood Company
             as separate divisions.  The purpose of these
             consolidations was to simplify the Company's
             organizational structure, and has no impact on the
             operations of these divisions.

</TABLE>

            These companies are principally marketers of branded
apparel except for American Recreation Products, Inc. and
Slumberjack which are manufacturers and marketers of branded
camping soft goods and Crowntuft Manufacturing Corp. which is a
vertically integrated manufacturer of chenille robes.

            In addition to its domestic acquisitions, in the early
1980's, the Company acquired Smart Shirts Limited of Hong Kong, a
leading shirt and blouse manufacturer in the Far East.  Smart
Shirts has, since its acquisition, continued to diversify its
manufacturing capabilities from its principal base of Hong Kong to
the People's Republic of China, Sri Lanka, Saipan and Costa Rica.

            Kellwood has invested $231 million acquiring the 12 U.S.
companies above and companies in Saipan and Costa Rica since the
inception of the acquisition program that began in 1985.  These
investments were primarily financed by cash provided from
operations and short-term borrowings.  Kellwood's short-term
borrowings related to these acquisitions were subsequently replaced
with long-term notes due insurance companies or repaid with cash
repatriated from Kellwood's Far East operations, other cash
provided by operations, or cash provided by the public sale of
common stock.  The total investment in subsidiaries was
approximately $28,324,000, $42,266,000, and $10,301,000 for 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

            As a result of the above business strategy, the Company
has redirected its focus from primarily the manufacturing of
private label apparel and home fashions for Sears to a marketing-
driven emphasis on branded apparel and related soft goods.  The
Company's acquisition strategy has further diversified its customer
base and has broadened its channels of distribution.  As a result
of these efforts, sales to Sears declined to 9% of total sales in
fiscal year 1994, compared to 50% in fiscal year 1985.

       (b)  All of the Company's operations are in the apparel and
related soft goods industry.

                                    -2-
<PAGE> 3

       (c)  The Company manufactures and markets apparel and other
soft goods products made from cloth or fabric or knitted from yarn.
These products are manufactured primarily domestically and in the
Far East.

            (i)     The Company's products include diversified lines of
men's, women's and children's clothing, furnishings for the home,
sleeping bags, and other soft goods.  Products are mainly sold to
retailers under either the Company's or customer's brands and
labels.

            (ii)    The Company anticipates no significant change in
products or new industry segments which would require a material
investment.  However, business acquisitions within the apparel and
related soft goods industry are continually being considered, and
it is anticipated that external and internal growth will generate
increasing requirements for capital.  The Company has negotiated a
$120 million fully committed revolving credit agreement to replace
its current $60 million agreement which expired on July 1, 1994.
The combined operating, cash and equity position of the Company
should continue to provide the capital flexibility necessary to
fund future opportunities as well as to meet existing obligations.

            (iii)   The Company purchases the majority of its raw
materials directly from numerous textile mills and yarn producers
and converters.  The Company has not experienced difficulty in
obtaining raw materials essential to its business.

            (iv)    The Company holds patents covering various aspects
of its products, the machinery used to manufacture its products,
and various manufacturing processes.  The Company is a licensee of
certain trade names and patented machines and processes.  The
expiration, or invalidation, of any of the patents or licenses
would not, in the opinion of management, have a material effect
upon the continuation of business.

            (v)     Although specific styles are seasonal, the Company's
various product lines are manufactured and sold on a year-round
basis.  Products are primarily manufactured and sold prior to each
of the principal retail selling seasons including spring, summer,
fall and holiday.

            (vi)    Consistent with the seasonality of specific product
offerings, the Company carries necessary levels of inventory to
meet the anticipated delivery requirements of its customers.

            (vii)   Approximately $150,130,000 (12%) of the
Company's sales in the fiscal year ended April 30, 1994, were to J.
C. Penney Company, Inc. ("J. C. Penney").  No other customer
accounts for more than 10% of the Company's revenues.
Approximately $112,236,000 (9%) of the Company's sales in the
fiscal year ended April 30, 1994, were to Sears, Roebuck and
Co. ("Sears").  Other information relating to J. C. Penney and
Sears is set forth in the Company's 1994 Annual Report to
Shareowners, under the caption "Significant Customers" in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is
incorporated herein by reference.  The Company's management
believes that the relationships with J. C. Penney and Sears will
continue into the foreseeable future.

            (viii)  Approximately 30% of the Company's domestic
sales are produced under contracts for distribution on a seasonal
basis.  It is normal for the merchandise manufactured under these
contracts to be sold within 12 months after production.  Because of
this, the Company does not believe backlog is important for this
merchandise.  In addition to these contracts, the backlog for
domestic operations totalled approximately $302 million as of April
30, 1994 ($209 million - 1993).  The backlog for Far East
operations totalled approximately $90 million ($89 million - 1993).
All of the Company's backlog is expected to be filled within 12
months.

            (ix)    Government contracts or subcontracts with the
Company are not material.

            (x)     The Company has substantial competition from
numerous manufacturers and marketers, but accurate statistics
relative to the competitive position of the Company are not
available.

                                    -3-
<PAGE> 4

            (xi)    The Company has a continuing program for the purpose
of improving its products and production machinery.  The Company is
not engaged in any material customer sponsored research and
development programs.  The dollar amount spent in the research and
development activities during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 was not
material.

            (xii)   In the opinion of management, there will be no
material effect on the Company resulting from compliance with any
federal, state or local provisions which have been enacted or
adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment
or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

            (xiii)  At the end of fiscal 1994, there were
approximately 15,500 people employed by the Company.  Substantially
all of the work force is non-union, and the Company considers its
relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

       (d)  Except for its Far East operations, the Company's foreign
activities including foreign manufacturing operations and customers
have not been material.  The Company owns all of the outstanding
shares of Smart Shirts Limited, a Hong Kong corporation engaged in
apparel manufacturing, and other Far East companies under Smart
Shirts' management.  The sales, operating profit, and identifiable
assets attributable to each geographic area is set forth in the
Company's 1994 Annual Report to Shareowners, under the caption
"Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information" in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which note is incorporated
herein by reference.  The risk attendant to the Company's Far East
operations is slightly greater than that of domestic operations
primarily due to quota allocations and political instability.
Utilization of existing quota rights and diversification of Far
East manufacturing capacity to various countries help to mitigate
these risks.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

       At April 30, 1994, the Company operated 32 production plants
and various distribution facilities.  Domestic business operated 19
plants in eight states, two plants in the Dominican Republic, one
plant in Honduras and one plant in Canada.  These domestically
managed plants aggregated to approximately 3,350,000 square feet
and were operating at an estimated 87% of capacity at April 30,
1994.  Nineteen of these domestically managed plants were primarily
producing private label goods and four were primarily producing
branded goods.  The Company's Far East subsidiaries operated nine
plants which aggregated to approximately 800,000 square feet and
were operating at an estimated 90% of capacity.  Far East
subsidiaries manage operations in Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Saipan,
Costa Rica and China.

       In management's opinion, current facilities generally are well
maintained and provide adequate production capacity for future
operations.  However, management continues to evaluate the need to
reposition the Company's portfolio of businesses and facilities to
meet the needs of the changing markets it serves and reflect the
international business environment.

       The Company's operating facilities are primarily leased under
long-term capital leases with renewal options at decreasing
rentals.  Certain facilities are leased under operating leases that
generally contain renewal options.  The Company also leases its
corporate space in St. Louis County, Missouri and major showrooms
in New York City, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; and
Los Angeles, California.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

       The Company is involved in several routine lawsuits incidental
to the Company's business.  Management and general counsel are of
the opinion that the ultimate disposition of such litigation should
have no material adverse effect on the Company's financial position
or results of operations.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

       None.

               Determination of Award".

6.   Adjustments to Targeted Criterion

     The Committee shall have the power, exercisable at its sole
     discretion, to adjust the Targeted Criterion to reflect any
     major alterations in the course of the business or to exclude
     the effects of any action by the Board or of any changes in

          restricted Company Stock.

          lapse, and the stock shall be transferred to the

                                    4                         Rev. 3-94
<PAGE> 5

          participant from the escrow at the rate of 25% a year,
          with the first release on the first business day in
          December each year, and the remaining 75% in three equal
          installments commencing on the first business day in June
          of the year following the calendar year in which the
          award is earned and on each first business day of each
          June thereafter.
     D.   In the event of the death, Disability or Retirement of a
          Participant during a Fiscal Year, the Participant or his
          beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a pro rata
          portion of the Award which would otherwise have been due
          to him had he remained an Employee until the end of the
          Company's Fiscal Year based on the number of full months
          during which the Employee was employed during the
          Company's Fiscal Year.
     E.   In the event of Disability or Retirement of a
          Participant, or in the case of an officer of the Company,
          termination of employment within one year following a
          Change in Control of the Company, the restricted stock
          which was in escrow as of the date of the Participant's
          Disability or Retirement shall be released from escrow in
          accordance with the release dates at the same rate as if
          the Participant continued as an Employee.  The
          Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may
          accelerate the lapse of restrictions in the event of a
          particular hardship affecting the employee at or after
          the employee's retirement.
     F.   In the event of the death of a Participant, any
          restricted Stock, which was in escrow as of the date of
          the Participant's death, shall be released and shall be
          paid to such one or more beneficiaries as the Participant
          may have designated in writing and filed with the
          Secretary of the Committee.  Beneficiaries may be named
          contingently or successively and may share in different
          portions, if so designated by the Participant.  If no
          beneficiary has been designated, the payments shall be
          made to the estate of the decedent.
     G.   In the event of a Sale of Part of the Company and as a
          result of it the Participant is terminated, the
          Committee, in its sole discretion, may accelerate all of
          the release dates on restricted Stock and cash of Awards
          earned by the terminated Participant.  The acceleration
          may be immediate or for a period of not to exceed three
          (3) years after the termination.
     H.   The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may
          accelerate the lapse of restrictions in the event of a
          particular hardship affecting the employee at or after
          the employee's retirement.

                                    5                         Rev. 3-94
<PAGE> 6

8.   Forfeitures

     Upon the termination of employment of a Participant from the
     services of all Employers due to any reason other than death,
     Disability, Retirement, or in the case of an officer of the
     Company within one year following a Change in Control of the
     Company, any restricted Stock then in the escrow on the date
     of such termination shall be forfeited by the Participant,
     except as provided in Section 7, G.  Any restricted Stock
     forfeited hereunder shall be available for further awards
     under the Plan.

9.   Change in Capitalization

     A.   In the event of any Stock dividend, split-up,
          reclassification or other changes in the Stock, the
          Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems
          equitable to accomplish the purpose of the Plan.  A
          Committee's determination as to any adjustments shall be
          final and conclusive.
     B.   Each participant who receives an Award of restricted
          Stock under the Plan shall be entitled to dividends on
          the shares of restricted Stock and to all the rights of
          a stockholder with respect to the restricted stock from
          the date restricted Stock was issued.  Any Stock received
          as a result of a Stock dividend or Stock split, or
          otherwise in respect of any restricted Stock, shall be
          subject to the same restrictions as the original Stock.

10.  Administration and Interpretation of the Plan

     The Committee shall have full responsibility for the
     administration of the Plan and may establish rules deemed by
     it to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan.
     The decision of the Committee with respect to selection of
     Participants, the amount of Targeted Shares and Awards, and
     the interpretation of the Plan shall be conclusive and binding
     on all parties.

11.  Miscellaneous

     A.   By acceptance of any Award under this Plan, the
          Participant agrees that the value of any Stock issued to
          him pursuant to an Award is special compensation and that
          the value of the Stock will not be taken into account in
          determining the amount of any pension or other retirement
          benefits under any Employer's retirement program, the
          amount of life insurance coverage under any Employer's
          program, or be considered as "income" in determining the
          gross monthly indemnity under any Employer's long-term
          disability benefit program.
     B.   No interest of a Participant may be sold, donated,

                                    6                         Rev. 3-94
<PAGE> 7

          pledged, or otherwise assigned or otherwise transferred
          in whole or in part, except by will or the laws of
          descent and distribution.
     C.   The Awards hereunder shall not be funded in any way by
          the Company, but shall remain unfunded obligations of the
          Company.
     D.   Participation in the Plan does not give a Participant any
          right to be retained as an Employee of any Employer.
     E.   The delivery of any Stock under the Plan to a Participant
          may also be subject to such other provisions as the
          Committee determines appropriate, including any which may
          be considered necessary to comply with federal or state
          securities laws or stock exchange requirements or
          withholding tax requirements.
     F.   The titles and headings of the sections in this Plan are
          for convenience or reference only and in the event of any
          conflict, the text of this Plan, rather than such
          headings, shall control.

12.  Adoption Amendments or Termination of the Plan

     A.   After the initial approval of this Plan by the
          Stockholders of the Company, the Committee shall have the
          right to extend the length of this Plan, amend or modify
          this Plan from time to time, or to terminate this Plan
          entirely or to discontinue the establishment of Targeted
          Shares, either temporarily or permanently; provided,
          however, no amendment or modification of this Plan or its
          termination shall affect or impair the provisions of any
          Award theretofore made without the written consent of
          each Participant whose Award would be affected or
          impaired by the amendment, modification or termination.
     B.   This Plan is effective as of May 1, 1983.
     C.   Unless extended by the Board, no Award may be made under
          this Plan after July 1, 1996.

13.  Immediate Release from Escrow

     Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, upon (i) a
     Change in Control of the Company, or (ii) a resolution to the
     following effect by the Committee passed after commencement of
     a tender offer or other acquisition plan or program by any
     person which, if consummated in accordance with its terms,
     would result in a Change in Control of the Company; then all
     restrictions on stock in escrow shall automatically and
     immediately lapse, and all restricted stock which was in
     escrow as of the above pertinent date shall be released from
     escrow immediately and transferred to the Participants.

14.  Withholding

     When a participant is required to pay to the Company an amount

                                    7                         Rev. 3-94
<PAGE> 8

     required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, in
     connection with the release of shares under the Plan, the
     Committee may, in its discretion and subject to such rules as
     it may adopt, permit the participant to satisfy the
     obligation, in whole or in part, by electing to have the
     Company withhold shares of Common Stock having a fair market
     value equal to the amount required to be withheld.  The
     election must be made on or before the date that the amount of
     tax to be withheld is determined (the "Tax Date").  The fair
     market value of the shares to be withheld is the average of
     the high and low market price of the Common Stock on the New
     York Stock Exchange on the Tax Date.  Fractional amounts will
     be paid in cash.  Elections will be subject to the following
     restrictions:  (1) they must be made on or prior to the Tax
     Date, (2) they will be irrevocable, and (3) they will be
     subject to the disapproval of the Committee.  Elections by
     participants whose transactions in Common Stock are subject to
     Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
     ("Officers") will be subject to the following additional
     restrictions:  (1) they may not be made within six months of
     the grant of the award (except that this limitation will not
     apply in the event death or disability of the participant
     occurs prior to the expiration of the six-month period), and
     (2) they must be made either six months or more prior to the
     Tax Date or in a ten day "window period" beginning on the
     third day following the release of the Company's quarterly or
     annual summary statement of sales and earnings.

                                    8                         Rev. 3-94

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The management of Kellwood Company is responsible for the fair
presentation of the financial statements and other financial information
included in this report.  The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applying estimates
and management's best judgments as required to present fairly Kellwood
Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

   The accounting systems and internal accounting controls of Kellwood are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial records are
reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability
for assets and that, in all material respects, assets are safeguarded against
loss from unauthorized use or disposition.  Qualified personnel throughout
the organization maintain and monitor these internal accounting controls on
an ongoing basis, and internal auditors systematically review the adequacy
and effectiveness of the controls.  Price Waterhouse also studies and
evaluates internal controls for the purpose of establishing a basis for
reliance thereon relative to the scope of their audits of the financial
statements.  It is management's opinion that the Company has an effective
system of internal accounting controls.

   The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee consisting solely of
nonmanagement directors, meets periodically with management, the internal
auditors and Price Waterhouse to discuss audit and financial reporting
matters.  Both the internal auditors and Price Waterhouse have direct access
to the Audit Committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareowners and Board of Directors of Kellwood Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, of cash flows and of
shareowners' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Kellwood Company and its subsidiaries at April 30, 1994 and 1993,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended April 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of Kellwood's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 1.   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Substantially
all foreign subsidiaries are consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March
31.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.


 2.   INVENTORIES AND REVENUE RECOGNITION: Inventories are stated at the lower
of cost or market.  The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method is used to determine
the value of 54% of the domestic inventories, and the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method is used to value the remaining domestic inventories.  Inventories
of foreign subsidiaries are valued using the specific identification method.
Sales are recognized when goods are shipped.


 3.   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost.  A significant portion of domestic manufacturing facilities and some
machinery and equipment are leased under long-term capital leases which are
recorded at the beginning of the lease term at the present value of the minimum
lease payments.
      Depreciation is computed generally on the declining balance method over
estimated useful lives of 15 to 40 years for buildings and of 3 to 10 years for
machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized principally on the
straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining lease term.


 4.   INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The excess costs over net tangible assets of businesses
acquired are recorded as intangible assets.  These intangibles are amortized
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which range
from 1 to 20 years.


 5.   POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS: Effective in 1994, Kellwood
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  The principles of
SFAS 106 require recognition of postretirement benefits on an accrual basis.
The adoption of SFAS 106 had an insignificant effect on the Company's financial
position and results of operations.


 6.   INCOME TAXES: Effective in 1993, Kellwood adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The
adoption of SFAS 109 had an insignificant effect on the Company's financial
position and results of operations.
      In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 109, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the financial
statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities.  For 1992, deferred
taxes were recognized for the effect of timing differences between financial
and tax reporting in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion (APB) No. 11.


 7.   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Foreign currency financial statements and
transactions are translated into United States dollars using period-end rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities and monthly average rates of exchange for
sales, costs and expenses.  Gains and losses resulting from translation are
accumulated in the Cumulative Translation Adjustment component of Shareowners'
Equity.  Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in
income in the period in which they occur.  The net foreign currency gains and
losses recognized in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were not significant.


 8.   EARNINGS PER SHARE: Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing
net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding of 20,851,328 for the year ended April 30, 1994 (20,655,642 for 1993
and 18,083,040 for 1992).  Common stock equivalents are excluded from the
primary earnings per share computation because their dilutive effect is not
significant. During 1994, 35,981 shares of common stock were issued upon
conversion of 9% convertible subordinated debentures.  Had the conversions taken
place on May 1, 1993, primary earnings per share for 1994 would not have been
significantly different.
      In March 1992, 2,587,500 shares of common stock, previously held as
treasury stock, were sold through a public offering. Proceeds from the sale of
the stock were used in part to repay domestic short-term borrowings under demand
notes.  Had the portion of the offering necessary to repay such year-to-date
average borrowings of $29,719 been outstanding since May 1, 1991, and
considering the related reduction in after tax interest expense, primary
earnings per share would have been $1.21 for 1992.
      The calculation of fully diluted earnings per share includes common stock
equivalents in addition to the weighted average shares outstanding as defined
above and assumes that all convertible debentures were converted to common stock
at the beginning of the year.  The average number of shares used in the fully
diluted computation was 21,251,760 in 1994 (21,036,805 in 1993 and 18,565,300 in
1992).  Net earnings are increased by the after tax interest on the convertible
debentures in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share.

ACQUISITIONS:

On July 1, 1993, all of the capital stock of Goodman Knitting
Co., Inc., a designer and marketer of branded apparel, was
purchased for cash.  The acquisition has been accounted for
using the purchase method and, accordingly, the results of
operations are included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings
from the date of acquisition.  Assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were recorded at their estimated fair market value, and
the excess costs over net tangible assets are being amortized
over the estimated useful lives of the related intangible assets.
Had the purchase taken place May 1, 1992, unaudited pro forma
consolidated net sales would have been $1,210,838 and $1,128,775
for the years ended April 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Consolidated net earnings and earnings per share would not have
been significantly different.
      All of the capital stock of AJ Brandon, Inc., and California
Ivy, Inc., was purchased for cash on December 30, 1992, and
July 10, 1992, respectively.  Both companies design and market
branded sportswear apparel.  These acquisitions were also
accounted for using the purchase method with the excess costs
over net tangible assets being amortized over the estimated
useful lives of the related intangible assets.  Had the purchases
taken place May 1, 1991, unaudited pro forma consolidated net
sales would have been $1,137,170 and $1,036,211 for the years
ended April 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Consolidated net
earnings and earnings per share would not have been significantly
different.


ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:

The allowance for doubtful accounts at April 30, 1994, was
$4,273  ($4,118 at April 30, 1993).


INVENTORIES:

Inventory valued under the LIFO method totalled $71,211 at April
30, 1994 ($72,693 at April 30, 1993).  The remainder of the
inventory was valued using the FIFO and specific identification
methods. If LIFO inventories had been valued at current
replacement costs, they would have totalled $80,382 at April 30,
1994 ($81,687 at April 30, 1993).

Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks,
customer lists, contractor networks and agreements not to
compete.  They arise from the allocation of purchase prices of
businesses acquired.  Values assigned to such identifiable
intangibles were based on independent appraisals or internal
estimates.  Goodwill represents any residual purchase price after
allocation to all identifiable net assets.


NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT:

1.    NOTES PAYABLE: A revolving credit agreement dated July 1,
1991, provides a $60,000 line of credit through July 1, 1994, with
interest at the interbank rate plus 5/8% to 3/4% and a fee of
3/10% on any unused portion.  Covenants under the credit agreement
are substantially the same as for Kellwood's notes due insurance
companies.  At April 30, 1994, unused committed credit under this
facility totalled $60,000, and unused uncommitted lines of credit
totalled $166,500 with various banks at rates less than prime.
The Company is currently negotiating a new revolving credit
agreement in the amount of $120,000, which will become effective
July 1, 1994.
      During the year ended April 30, 1994, the highest level of
borrowings under all lines was $128,887 ($118,051 for 1993).  For
the year, the average daily short-term borrowings were $54,840
($60,036 for 1993) and the weighted average interest rate was
3.8% (4.1% for 1993).

$18,256; 1998 - $15,481; 1999 - $15,462.

Notes payable to insurance companies are due in quarterly
and semiannual installments from June 1994 through September
2005.  Restrictive covenants of these notes include the
maintenance of minimum working capital and certain key ratios as
well as a limitation on the payment of dividends and the
repurchase of Company stock.  Under the most restrictive
covenants, future dividends and purchases of Company stock are
limited to $61,706 plus 45% of net earnings after April 30, 1994,
excluding gains and losses on the disposal of capital assets.
      The 9% convertible subordinated debentures may be converted
into common stock by debenture holders at a rate of $6.33 per
share at any time prior to maturity on October 15, 1999, subject
to certain restrictions.  Also, subject to certain restrictions,
the debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option
of the Company at predetermined redemption prices.  During 1994,
$228 principal amount of these debentures was converted into
35,981 shares of common stock.  Interest on outstanding
debentures is paid semiannually.  The debentures are subordinated
to senior indebtedness, as provided for in the agreements.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

1.    RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS: Various
contributory and noncontributory retirement plans cover
substantially all domestic and certain foreign employees. Benefits
under pension plans are generally based on years of service and
compensation.  Pension plans are funded in accordance with the
applicable laws and regulations plus such amounts, if any, as the
actuarial consultants advise to be appropriate. Company
contributions under the contributory retirement plan are
determined based on formulas defined in the plan.
      The total credit under all retirement plans was $(3,569),
$(3,661), and $(4,086) in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.
The total credits reflect $(6,638), $(6,563), and $(6,620) for
defined benefit plans.

The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets used in
determining the projected benefit obligation was 8.0%.  The
discount rate was 8.25% for 1994 and 8.5% for 1993 and 1992.  The
rate of increase in future compensation levels was 5.5% for 1994
and 6% for 1993 and 1992.  The change in actuarial assumptions
had an insignificant effect on the net pension credit for 1994.
The assets of the retirement plans consist primarily of U.S.
Government obligations, corporate debt obligations, short-term
marketable debt securities, marketable equity securities and
guaranteed income contracts.
      The Company provides health care insurance benefits to
certain employees upon retirement.  The annual costs of these
benefits in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were not significant.

2.    INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS: Options to purchase common
stock have been granted to key employees under various plans at
option prices not less than the fair market value on the date of
the grant.  At April 30, 1994, 122 officers and other key
employees held options to purchase shares.  The options expire 10
years after grant on dates ranging from May 1994 to February 2004
and are exercisable in  cumulative installments only after stated
intervals of time and are conditional upon active employment,
except for periods following disability or retirement.

The amended Restricted Stock Compensation Plan of 1969 and
the Corporate Development Incentive Plan of 1986 provide for the
granting of common stock to key employees as performance and
incentive bonuses.  The shares granted may not be transferred,
sold, pledged or otherwise disposed of prior to the lapse of
certain restrictions.  Under the plans, $1,459 was charged to
earnings in 1994 for shares to be issued after the end of the
year ($1,062 in 1993 and $1,320 in 1992).  At April 30, 1994,
473,613 shares were available to be granted under these plans to
qualified employees.


CAPITAL STOCK:

The Board of Directors declared a three-for-two split of the
common stock effective March 18, 1994.  All share and per share
data for the periods presented in the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect the
split.
      The reported outstanding shares of common stock have been
reduced by treasury stock totalling 3,232,992 shares at April 30,
1994 (3,159,990 at April 30, 1993, and 3,143,000 at April 30,
1992).
      Authorized capital includes 500,000 shares of preferred
stock, none of which have been issued.  Nonvoting share purchase
rights, exercisable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions,
entitle the holder to purchase Series A Junior Preferred Stock
(160,000 shares reserved) or, under certain conditions, common
shares at prices specified in the rights agreement.  None of the
rights were exercisable as of April 30, 1994.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)

Domestic operations include marketing-oriented branded businesses
offering apparel and camping soft goods, and manufacturing-oriented
private label units offering apparel and home fashions product lines.
Domestic operations produce goods in the United States, the
Caribbean, and Canada.  Far East operations produce high quality,
competitively priced, private label cotton and cotton-blended shirts
and blouses in Hong Kong, China, Sri Lanka, Saipan and Costa Rica.
In addition to the Company's owned and leased plants, products are
sourced through contracting relationships with other manufacturers in
various countries.  The Company sells its products through multiple
channels of distribution, including national retail chains,
department stores, specialty stores, mass merchants, mail order
houses, sporting goods stores and other manufacturers.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 1994

Kellwood Company achieved record sales and net earnings for the year
ended April 30, 1994.  The fiscal 1994 growth came from a combination
of internal growth and acquisitions.  The internal growth was
attributable to increased volume with existing and new accounts as
well as several marketing programs initiated in 1994. These marketing
programs also provide growth opportunities for the upcoming fiscal
year and beyond.
      Sales by Domestic branded operations were up $175 million or
28% reflecting the continued success of Kellwood's acquisition
strategy.  The increase in branded sales is approximately 55%
attributable to recent acquisitions with the remaining 45% from
internal growth of existing business units.  Sales from the
branded portfolio accounted for 66% of Kellwood's total volume
for fiscal 1994.  This compares to 58% last year and puts the
Company well on its way to achieving its goal of 75% from the
branded sector.  The growth in the Domestic branded operations
with their overall higher margins contributed significantly to
the improvement in total Company earnings.
      Sales by Domestic private label operations were down 16%, or
$45 million, below the level reported last year principally
because Sears closed its catalog operation.  Operating profits in
the Domestic private label portfolio were adversely affected by
the decline in sales and by continuing margin pressure,
especially in the lingerie market.
      Sales by Far East operations, principally of high quality
private label shirts sold to U.S. department stores and premier
mail order houses, decreased $4 million or 3% below the prior
year.  The decline in sales was caused by changes in capacity as
production was shifted among plants.  During 1994, Kellwood's
manufacturing capacity was expanded in China and Sri Lanka, and
productivity was improved in Saipan and Hong Kong.  Far East
operating margins improved significantly from last year because
of these changes.
      Sales to J.C. Penney in 1994 exceeded $150 million, an
increase of $37 million, or 33% over 1993.  J.C. Penney is now
Kellwood's largest customer and is being serviced by all 15
operating units of the Company.
      Improved earnings were achieved as the result of greater
sales volume, more effective sourcing, increased branded product
sales, and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate.  The
increase in amortization expense results from increased
intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions.  The
increase in interest expense correlates with the increase in
average outstanding debt.  The decrease in the effective tax rate
is due to changes in the earnings mix.
      Operating results include gains in the disposal of certain
excess export quota rights.  Additional quota disposals, which
would result in gains, are continually evaluated based upon
operating needs and market conditions.  Quota prices for the
categories held by Kellwood have dropped substantially since the
first quarter of fiscal 1994.


FISCAL 1993

In terms of results and positioning the Company for future growth,
1993 was a productive year for Kellwood.  Sales increased 18% in
1993, and net earnings increased 26%.  The growth in sales was broad-
based across all three business portfolios and every channel of
distribution.
      The sales increase was most significant in the Domestic
branded portfolio which experienced an increase of 27% or $134.5
million for the year.  Approximately half of the increase was due
to the acquisitions of California Ivy, Inc., and AJ Brandon, Inc.
The Domestic branded businesses with their overall higher margins
continued to contribute significantly to total earnings; however,
their profits were partially offset by costs associated with
restructuring Kellwood's two start-up divisions into other
business units.
      Sales to Sears, which represented 15% of total Kellwood
sales in 1993, increased 1% as the result of additional volume
from Domestic branded and Far East operations even though there
was

a 4% decline in Domestic private label sales to Sears.  Total
sales by Domestic private label units were up 8%, or $21 million,
because of additional business with customers other than Sears.
      Sales by Far East operations increased 5%, or $7.5 million.
Far East operating margins improved significantly from 1992
because of a shift of production from operations in Taiwan to
more efficient plants in Hong Kong, China and Sri Lanka.
      The 26% increase in net earnings for 1993 was primarily
attributable to increased volume, improved operating efficiency
and product sourcing, and a shift in mix to higher margin branded
volume.  These gains were partially offset by the higher
amortization expense of intangible assets associated with recent
acquisitions and lower income from the disposal of certain excess
export quota rights in Hong Kong.


FISCAL 1992

Sales by Domestic branded units increased $70 million, or 17%,
including a $62 million, or 15%, increase in ongoing branded
businesses and additional volume attributable to decorp, acquired
in October 1990.  Sales have increased across Kellwood's various
branded product offerings with sales to the national retail
chains and specialty stores showing the largest growth.  Sales to
Sears increased 4% because of the additional branded volume, even
though there was a 2% decline in Domestic private label sales to
Sears.  Total sales by Domestic private label units were up 7%
because of additional business with customers other than Sears.
Sales by Far East operations increased $20 million, or 15%, in
1992 because of strong demand for their high-quality products and
a broadening of Smart Shirts' customer base.
      Gross profit margin increased to 20% of sales in 1992
reflecting improvements by both Domestic and Far East operations.
The improvement in overall operating results was primarily
attributable to higher volume and better gross margins generated
by Domestic branded businesses.  Operating problems related to
plants in Costa Rica and Saipan adversely affected earnings
before income taxes by $3 million in 1992.  The 83% increase in
net earnings for 1992 reflects the improvement in sales and
margins and lower interest expense, even though gains on disposal
of assets and interest income were down.  The 1992 gain on disposal
of assets represents gains on the sale of certain excess export quota
rights in Hong Kong.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

The current ratio was 2.7 to 1 at April 30, 1994, as compared to 1.9
to 1 at April 30, 1993.  Accounts receivable and inventory levels,
especially after netting for the effects of recent acquisitions, are
at very satisfactory levels.  The improved net accounts receivable
and inventory levels contributed significantly to the increase in
cash provided by operating activities.
      The decrease in the cash used for investing activities
resulted primarily from the completion of only one significant
acquisition (Goodman Knitting Co.) during 1994 versus two
acquisitions (AJ Brandon, Inc. and California Ivy, Inc.) last
year.  Viable acquisition candidates that would expand and
complement Kellwood's existing portfolio of companies are
continually being considered.  Capital expenditures, excluding
acquisitions and related payments, were $12.5 million in 1994,
compared with $16.8 million in 1993 and $12.6 million in 1992.
There are no material commitments for capital expenditures as of
April 30, 1994.  Ten million dollars was repatriated from Far
East operations in 1994, compared with $20 million in 1993 and
$10 million in 1992.
      Total debt represents 36% of capitalization at April 30,
1994, compared to 42% at April 30, 1993.  During 1994, Kellwood
converted $60 million of its short-term borrowings to long-term
debt.  The remaining short-term borrowings were repaid with cash
generated from operations.  The Company is currently negotiating
a $120 million fully committed revolving credit agreement that
will replace its current $60 million agreement which expires on
July 1, 1994.
      Cash provided by operations and borrowings under various
lines of credit are the primary sources of liquidity.  The
combined operating, cash and equity position of the Company
should continue to provide the capital flexibility necessary to
fund future opportunities and to meet existing obligations.


OUTLOOK

Almost every economic indicator points to an improving economy and a
more receptive consumer.  The consumer, while perhaps more willing to
buy, is definitely looking for value when shopping for apparel.  This
plays to one of the Company's core strengths.  Kellwood is poised to
respond through its market niche brands and broad based private label
capability.
