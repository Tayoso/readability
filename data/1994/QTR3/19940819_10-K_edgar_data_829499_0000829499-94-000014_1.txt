Item 1.   Business
- - -------   --------

General
- - -------

          Interstate Bakeries Corporation (the "Company") was organized in
1987 as a Delaware corporation under the name IBC Holdings Corp. and through
its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Interstate Brands Corporation, is the
largest independent and third largest baker and distributor of fresh bakery
products in the United States.  The Company or its predecessors have baked and
distributed fresh bread and cake products since 1927.  The Company has grown
to its present size primarily through acquisitions of other bakery businesses.
In its 1988 fiscal year, the Company underwent a change in control through a
leveraged buyout transaction and acquired 10 bakeries in the Southeastern
United States.

          The Company operates 31 bakeries throughout the United States and
employs over 14,000 people.  From these geographically dispersed bakeries, the
Company's driver-salesmen deliver baked goods to more than 100,000 food
outlets on more than 4,000 delivery routes.  The Company's products are
distributed throughout the United States through its direct route system and
its 790 Company-operated thrift stores, and to some extent through
distributors.

          The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 12
East Armour Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri 64111, and the telephone number
is (816) 561-6600.

Operating Divisions
- - -------------------

          Bread Division

          The principal products of the Bread Division are white breads,
variety breads, "lite" breads, rolls, buns and English muffins, marketed under
well-known brand names, including "Butternut", "Cotton's Holsum", "Eddy's",
"Holsum", "Merita", "Millbrook", "Mrs. Karl's", "Sweetheart" and "Weber's". 
The majority of the Bread Division's sales are generated by white breads and
variety breads, the latter consisting of whole wheat, rye and other whole
grain breads.  The Bread Division is the largest licensed baker and
distributor of "Roman Meal" and "Sun Maid" breads.  These products include
traditional Roman Meal bread, Roman Meal variety breads, Roman Meal light
breads and Roman Meal buns, rolls and English muffins and also include Sun
Maid's line of raisin bread and English muffins.

          In fiscal 1994, the Bread Division had net sales of $779,550,000,
which represented 68.2% of the net sales of the Company.  The Bread Division's
sales are generally concentrated in the Southeast, Southern California, the
Midwest and certain Northern Mountain states.  Bread Division customers
consist primarily of supermarkets and are served by its separate distribution
system.  No single customer accounts for more than 5% of the Company's net
sales.  Many of the Bread Division's accounts are also serviced by the Cake
Division.

          The Bread Division faces intense competition in all of its markets
from large, national bakeries and smaller regional operators, as well as from
supermarket chains with their own bakeries or private label products.  The
Continental Baking Company (majority-owned by Ralston Purina), Campbell
Taggert, Inc. (owned by Anheuser-Busch) and Flowers Industries, Inc. are the
Bread Division's largest competitors, each marketing bread products under
various brand names.  The Bread Division from time to time experiences price
pressure in certain of its markets as a result of competitors' promotional
pricing practices.  However, management believes that the Company's geographic
diversity helps to limit the effect of regionally-based competition.  

                                    -3-

<PAGE>
Competition in the Bread Division's business is based on product quality,
price, brand loyalty, effective promotional activities and the ability to
identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences.  Customer service,
including frequency of deliveries and maintenance of fully stocked shelves, is
also an important competitive factor and is central to the competition for
retail shelf space among bread product distributors.

         Cake Division

          The Cake Division produces fresh baked sweet goods, including snack
cakes, donuts, sweet rolls, snack pies, breakfast pastries, variety cakes,
large cakes and shortcakes, approximately 90% of which are sold under the
nationally known "Dolly Madison Bakery" brand name.

          In fiscal 1994, the Cake Division had net sales of $347,371,000,
representing 30.4% of the net sales of the Company.  The Cake Division
distributes its products principally through convenience stores, in markets
representing approximately 75% of the U.S. population, in all areas of the
country except certain Northeast markets.

          No single customer represents more than 5% of the Company's net
sales.  The Company believes that its credit practices adequately address the
financial condition of its customers, particularly in the convenience store
industry.  Cake sales tend to be somewhat seasonal, with a historically weak
winter period, which management believes is attributable to home baking and
consumption patterns during the holiday seasons.  Spring and early summer
months are historically stronger due to the sale of shortcake products during
the fresh strawberry season.

          The wholesale cake industry is highly competitive with product
quality, retail account service and price being the most significant
competitive factors.  The Cake Division from time to time experiences price
pressures in certain of its markets as a result of competitors' promotional
pricing practices.  The Cake Division's ability to sell its products depends
on its ability to attain store shelf space in relation to competing cake
brands and other food products.  The Company competes primarily with a few
large national bakeries, as well as with certain regional bakeries. 
Continental Baking Company (majority-owned by Ralston Purina) and McKee
Baking, marketing cake products under the brand names Hostess and Little
Debbie, respectively, are the largest competitors of the Cake Division.

          Dry Products

          The Company's line of dry products consists of branded, dry, bread-
based products, including traditional stuffing and salad croutons, principally
under the "Mrs. Cubbison's" brand name.  The majority of the Company's dry
product sales (which account for l.4% of the Company's net sales) is generated
during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods.  The "Mrs. Cubbison's"
product line is distributed primarily in 11 western states through a
subsidiary that is 80% owned by the Company.  The largest market for the
Company's dry products is Southern California.

Raw Materials
- - -------------

          The ingredients of bread and cake products, principally flour, sugar
and edible oils, are readily available from numerous sources.  The Company
periodically engages in commodity futures hedging programs, and also attempts
to lock in prices through advance purchase contracts of up to six months in
duration when prices are expected to increase.  Through its program of central
purchasing of baking ingredients and packaging materials, the Company is able
to utilize its national presence to obtain competitive prices.  The Company
historically has been able to pass through most commodity price increases.

                                  -4-

<PAGE>
Management and Employees
- - ------------------------

          The Company employs over 14,000 people.  Approximately 75% of the
Company's employees are covered by approximately 250 union contracts. 
Unionized workers are generally members of either the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters or the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers
International Union.  The Company believes it has good relations with all of
its union and nonunion employees.


Governmental Regulation; Environmental Matters
- - ----------------------------------------------

          The Company's operations are subject to regulation by various
federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies.  As a baker of 
goods for human consumption, the Company's operations are subject to stringent
quality and labeling standards.  The operations of the Company's bakeries and
its delivery fleet are subject to various federal, state and local
environmental laws and workplace regulations, including the Occupational
Safety and Health Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Clean Air Act and the
Clean Water Act.  The Company believes that its current legal and
environmental compliance programs adequately address such concerns and that it
is in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.

Item 2.    Properties
- - -------    ----------

          The Company's principal properties are its bakeries, distribution
depots and thrift stores.  Shown below are the locations of the Company's
bakeries, all of which are owned with the exception of the Charlotte, North
Carolina, bread bakery, which is operated under a capital lease with an option
to purchase the facility in 1996, and the Dry Products bakery.  The Company
owns the building in Kansas City, Missouri in which its principal executive
offices are located.  The Company's distribution depots and thrift stores are
located throughout the Company's distribution area and the majority of these
facilities are leased.

does not foresee the need to make significant capital improvements to existing
facilities in the near future.  

                                  -5-

<PAGE>
          On June 13, 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of the
assets and liabilities of Fuchs Baking Co. of Miami, Florida.  Fuchs, which
has annual sales of approximately $50,000,000, distributes bakery products
throughout central and southern Florida from bakeries in Miami and Fort
Pierce, Florida.

          The Company operates 790 retail stores which sell its bakery
products not otherwise sold through its primary distribution system. 
Generally, each thrift store is between 500 and 1,200 square feet in size. 
Approximately 80% of the stores are located at the Company's distribution
depots, while the others are freestanding units located along the Company's
distribution routes.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings
- - -------   -----------------
          
          The Company has been named as a defendant in various claims arising
out of its normal business operations.  Based upon the facts available to
date, management believes that the Company has meritorious defenses to these
actions and that their ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position.

Interstate Bakeries Corporation


We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Interstate Bakeries
Corporation and its subsidiaries as of May 28, 1994 and May 29, 1993, and for
each of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 28, 1994, and have
issued our report thereon dated July 8, 1994; such consolidated financial
statements and report are included in your 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders
and are incorporated herein by reference.  Our audits also included the
consolidated financial statement schedules of Interstate Bakeries Corporation
and its subsidiaries, listed in Item 14.  These consolidated financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits.  In our opinion,
such consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

number of Directors within the minimum and maximum limitations specified in
the preceding sentence shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of
Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board
of Directors.  Upon the effectiveness of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes, designated
Class I, Class II and Class III, which at all times shall be as nearly equal

<PAGE>
incumbent Directors to Board of
Director Classes I, II and III at the time of the effectiveness of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to the Delaware General
Corporation Law shall be by a resolution adopted by a majority of the
Stockholders entitled to vote in an election of directors.  At each Annual
Meeting of Stockholders following such initial classification and election,
Directors elected to succeed those whose terms expire at the time of such
meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding Annual
Meeting of Stockholders after their election.  In the event of any increase in
the number of Directors of the Corporation, the additional Directors shall be
so classified that all classes of Directors shall be increased equally as
nearly as possible, and the additional Directors shall be elected by majority
vote of the Directors then in office.  Each Director shall hold office until
his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier
resignation or removal.  Election of Directors of the Corporation need not be
by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide.  Directors need not be
Stockholders.

5.02.  Removal of Directors.
       --------------------
Except as may be provided in any provision of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation authorizing the issuance of any Preferred Stock or as may be
provided in any Certificate of Designation authorizing the issuance of any
Preferred Stock pursuant to Article FOURTH hereof, any Director, or the entire
Board of Directors, may be removed from office only for cause and only by the
affirmative vote of the 

                                       -9-

<PAGE>
holders of a majority of the voting power of all of
the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors,
voting together as a single class.  For purposes of this Section 5.02, and
except as otherwise provided by law, cause for removal shall be deemed to
exist only if:

   (1)  the Director whose removal is proposed has been convicted, or where a
   Director was granted immunity to testify where another has been convicted, 
   of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction and such conviction is no 
   longer subject to appeal;

   (2)  such Director has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction
   to be liable for negligence or misconduct, in the performance of his or her
   duty to the Corporation, in a matter of substantial importance to the
   Corporation;

   (3)  such Director has become mentally incompetent, whether or not so
   adjudicated, which mental incompetency directly affects his or her ability 
   as a Director of the Corporation;

   (4)  such Director becomes disabled and such disability in the opinion of 
   the Board of Directors renders such Director unable to perform his or her 
   duties as provided herein or in the Bylaws;

                                       -10-
                                           
<PAGE>   
   (5)  such Director's actions or failure to act are deemed by the Board of
   Directors to be in derogation of the Director's duties; or

   (6)  such Director is found to be unsuitable to fulfill his or her 
   obligations as a Director of the Corporation by any regulatory agency 
   having jurisdiction over the Corporation.

            OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Results of Operations
- - --------------------------------------------------------

Fiscal 1994 Compared With Fiscal 1993

Net sales for the fiscal year ended May 28, 1994 were $1,142,684,000, down
$22,904,000 and 2.0% from the prior year's net sales of $1,165,588,000. 
The Company's withdrawal from the California cake market through the sale
of its Los Angeles cake operation accounted for the majority of the actual
net sales decline.  Bread Division net sales were $779,550,000, an
$11,584,000 and 1.5% increase from net sales of $767,966,000 in fiscal
1993.  This increase was attributable to higher selling prices and the
acquisition of the Tampa bread bakery, offset somewhat by a slight unit
volume decline in private label business.  Cake Division net sales for
fiscal 1994 were down $38,809,000, or 10.0%, to $347,371,000 from the prior
year's $386,180,000.  While the Los Angeles sale was the main factor in
this decline, cake volume related to ongoing business has also decreased
somewhat.

Gross profit for fiscal 1994 was $561,458,000 (49.1% of net sales) compared
to $575,584,000 (49.4% of net sales) for fiscal 1993, a 2.5% decline.  This
unfavorable comparison reflects the negative impact of unit volume declines
on overhead absorption.  Higher commodity costs during the latter half of
the year were essentially offset by higher selling prices.

Selling, delivery and administrative expenses increased $1,005,000 to
$473,607,000 (41.4% of net sales) for fiscal 1994 compared to $472,602,000
(40.5% of net sales) last year against a lower net sales base in fiscal
1994.  These unfavorable variances were attributable to higher labor and
labor related costs, combined with lower unit volume to absorb these and
other costs, and higher delivery costs associated with a two-month
transport drivers strike at one bakery.

Fiscal 1994 reflects $9,400,000 ($5,687,000 after tax, or $.28 per share)
of other charges, which includes costs related to a plant disposal of
$6,700,000 and environmental matters of $2,700,000.  After these other
charges, operating income for fiscal 1994 was $46,883,000 (4.1% of net
sales), a decrease of $24,461,000, or 34.3%, from the $71,344,000 (6.1% of
net sales) reported for fiscal 1993.

Interest expense for fiscal 1994 of $14,745,000 was down $2,643,000, or
15.2%, from fiscal 1993's $17,388,000.  The Company benefitted from
somewhat lower interest rates related to the renegotiation of its bank
credit agreement in November 1993, as well as generally lower market
interest rates during most of the year.

The Company's effective tax rate of 51.2% for fiscal 1994 reflects the
passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 during the first
quarter of the year.  The increase in the corporate tax rate provided for
in the Act raised the fiscal 1994 provision for income taxes by $1,131,000,
or $.06 per share.  Approximately $800,000 of this increase relates to the
cumulative adjustment of the Company's net deferred tax liability at May
29, 1993 and the additional current taxes attributable to the fiscal year
ended May 29, 1993.  Non-deductible goodwill amortization was also
responsible for the higher effective rates in fiscal 1994 and 1993.

Income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change was
$15,754,000, or $.78 per share, in fiscal 1994 compared to $30,784,000, or
$1.46 per share, the prior year.  During fiscal 1993, the Company incurred
a one-time, noncash charge of $14,121,000 ($.67 per share), net of an
income tax benefit of $8,655,000, representing the cumulative effect of
adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106.  Net
income was $15,754,000, or $.78 per share, for fiscal 1994 compared to
$16,663,000, or $.79 per share, for fiscal 1993.

Fiscal 1993 Compared With Fiscal 1992

Net sales for fiscal 1993, which ended May 29, 1993, were $1,165,588,000
representing an increase of $19,713,000, or 1.7%, over net sales of
$1,145,875,000 in fiscal 1992.  This increase resulted from modest selling
price increases during the year, offset somewhat by an overall slight unit
volume decline.  Bread Division net sales were up $21,873,000, or 2.9%, to
$767,966,000 from $746,093,000 in fiscal 1992.  Bread Division unit volume
was steady with the net sales gain reflecting moderate price increases
implemented to cover cost increases.  Cake Division net sales, at
$386,180,000, were down 1.1% from fiscal 1992's $390,285,000 due to a unit
volume decline, primarily in the West.

Fiscal 1993's gross profit of $575,584,000 (49.4% of net sales) represented
an increase of 2.1% over fiscal 1992's gross profit of $563,714,000 (49.2%
of net sales).  Higher selling prices were utilized to offset moderate
ingredient 

                                       14

<PAGE>
and labor cost increases, which, along with production
efficiencies, slightly improved margins.

Selling, delivery and administrative expenses were $472,602,000 (40.5% of
net sales) for fiscal 1993, an increase of 3.1% from $458,544,000 (40.0% of
net sales) for fiscal 1992.  This unfavorable variance resulted from higher
labor and labor related costs during fiscal 1993.

Operating income for fiscal 1993 was $71,344,000 (6.1% of net sales), down
$2,271,000, or 3.1%, from fiscal 1992's $73,615,000 (6.4% of net sales). 
This decrease reflects the factors noted above, as well as the incremental
noncash charge for the change in accounting for postretirement benefits
required by SFAS No. 106 adopted by the Company during fiscal 1993.

Interest expense decreased $7,644,000, or 30.5%, to $17,388,000.  This
reduction reflects lower interest rates and a continued deleveraging
subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 1992 initial public offering of
common stock.  Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt and
redeem the minority interest - redeemable preferred stocks.

The fiscal 1993 effective tax rate of 43.0% reflects the non-deductibility
of goodwill amortization, while the fiscal 1992 rate of 37.8% reflects this
amortization, offset by utilization of investment tax credit carryforwards. 
The adoption of SFAS No. 109 in fiscal 1993 had no impact on results of
operations.

Income before extraordinary charge and cumulative effect of accounting
change was $30,784,000, or $1.46 per share (including an approximate $.03
per share incremental charge for SFAS No. 106), compared to $25,780,000, or
$1.49 per share, for fiscal 1992.  During fiscal 1993, the Company incurred
a one-time, noncash charge of $14,121,000 ($.67 per share), net of an
income tax benefit of $8,655,000, representing the cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS No. 106.  In fiscal 1992, the Company incurred an
extraordinary charge of $10,176,000, or $.55 per share, net of an income
tax benefit of $6,184,000, related to additional interest payments and the
write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges in connection with the
retirement of debt.

Net income was $16,663,000, or $.79 per share, for fiscal 1993, compared to
$15,604,000, or $.94 per share, for fiscal 1992.



Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company's primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations
which totaled $53,087,000 for fiscal 1994, a decline of $4,055,000 from the
prior year's $57,142,000.  This decline primarily reflects lower operating
profits, offset to some extent by more favorable changes in working
capital.  Cash generated by operations during fiscal 1994,  along with a
net $4,281,000 increase in bank borrowings, was used to fund net capital
purchases of $24,867,000, to pay common stock dividends of $10,009,000 and
to repurchase common stock of $20,621,000 under the Company's share
repurchase program.

For fiscal 1995, the Company anticipates cash needs of approximately
$33,000,000 to fund $22,000,000 of planned capital expenditures, $9,700,000
of common stock dividends and $1,300,000 of required principal reductions
on debt.  The Company expects these needs to be funded by ongoing
operations.  At May 28, 1994, the Company also had unused borrowing capacity
of $66,000,000 under its bank credit facility.  During fiscal 1995, the
Company may use its excess cash from operations and available borrowing
capacity to repurchase up to 600,000 shares of common stock, reduce its
revolving credit borrowings and fund acquisitions.  In June 1994, the
Company acquired Fuchs Baking Co. of Miami, Florida.  This acquisition,
which has annual sales of approximately $50,000,000, was financed through
borrowings on the revolving credit facility.

Inflation

Inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's
results of operations.  The Company has generally been able to offset
inflationary price increases with production efficiencies and higher
selling prices.

          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               

1.  Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of business - Interstate Bakeries Corporation (the "Company") is
the largest independent and third largest baker and distributor of fresh
bakery products in the United States. 

Fiscal year end - The Company has a 52-53 week year that ends on the Saturday 
closest to the last day of May.

Principles of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include 
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  
Specific invoiced costs are used with respect to ingredients and average 
costs are used for other inventory items.

The components of inventories are as follows:

                                      (In Thousands)
                                    May 28,    May 29,
                                     1994       1993
                                   --------   --------
    Ingredients and packaging       $13,384    $14,208
    Finished goods                    5,907      6,497
    Other                             1,729      1,625
                                    -------    -------
                                    $21,020    $22,330
                                    =======    =======
                                  
Property and equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost and 
depreciated over estimated useful lives of 4 to 35 years, using the 
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods 
for tax purposes.  Interest cost capitalized as part of the construction 
cost of capital assets was $903,000 and $314,000 in fiscal 1994 and 1993, 
respectively.

Excess of purchase cost over net assets acquired - Excess of purchase cost 
over net assets acquired is amortized over 40 years using the straight-line 
method.  Accumulated amortization as of May 28, 1994 and May 29, 1993 was 
$46,091,000 and $39,017,000, respectively.

Interest rate swap agreements - The differential to be paid or received is 
accrued as interest rates change and is recognized over the term of the 
agreements.

Statement of cash flows - For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the 
Company considers all investments purchased with a maturity of three months 
or less to be cash equivalents.

Earnings per share - Per share amounts are calculated on the basis of the 
weighted average common shares outstanding and outstanding options to the 
extent they are dilutive.  The calculation for fiscal 1992 gives effect to 
the preferred dividend requirements related to preferred stocks.  Weighted 
average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were 20,306,000, 
21,132,000 and 18,735,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

                                   $201,235   $189,238
                                   ========   ========

(a)  During fiscal 1994, the Company renegotiated its bank credit agreement,
replacing the previous debt agreement with a $210,000,000 bank revolving
credit facility.  The new facility, which consists of a combination of
revolving loans and up to $60,000,000 in letters of credit (with availability
of $37,000,000 at May 28, 1994), matures during fiscal 1999.  The outstanding
borrowings, which are unsecured, bear interest at variable rates generally
equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus from .35% to 1.00%
(.50% at May 28, 1994), depending upon certain financial ratios.  The Company
also pays a fee of between .15% and .35% (.225% at May 28, 1994) on the
unused portion of the facility.

To offset the variable rate characteristic of a portion of these bank
borrowings, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with major
banks resulting in fixed interest rates of 6.84% on $21,000,000 through May
1996, 5.34% on $30,000,000 through July 1995, 5.27% on $30,000,000 through
January 1995 and 4.97% on $25,000,000 through July 1994.  The overall weighted
average interest rate on the bank borrowings was 5.73% and 6.16% at May 28,
1994 and May 29, 1993, respectively.

The new credit facility agreement contains covenants which, among other
matters (i) limit the Company's ability to incur indebtedness, merge,
consolidate and acquire or sell assets, (ii) require the Company to satisfy
certain ratios related to net worth, debt-to-capitalization and interest
coverage and (iii) limit the payment of cash dividends on common stock and
common stock repurchases to $25,000,000 for the year following the completion
of the agreement and 75% of aggregate consolidated net income thereafter, with
approximately $13,000,000 available at May 28, 1994.

(b)  Represents 10.00% notes issued to an owner of the Company's common stock. 
Principal is due in annual installments from July 1998 to July 2000.  The note
agreement was modified during fiscal 1994 to include covenants mirroring
those of the new credit agreement.  

                                       20

Interest expense on these notes totaled
$7,878,000, $7,878,000 and $6,569,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

The Company had long-term notes payable to related parties which were repaid
or exchanged in conjunction with the July 1991 public stock offering. 
Interest expense on these notes was $5,169,000 during fiscal 1992.  In
addition, the prepayment of a portion of these notes with the notes described
in (b) above required an additional $1,264,000 interest payment.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 107, "Disclosures About
Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires disclosure of the year end fair
value of significant financial instruments, including long-term debt.  The fair 
value of the senior notes, described in (b) above, is estimated at $87,400,000 
and $91,000,000 as of May 28, 1994 and May 29, 1993, respectively, based upon 
rates available for debt with similar terms.  The Company believes, based upon 
current terms, that the carrying value of all other long-term debt at May 28, 
1994 approximates fair value. 

The scheduled repayment of long-term debt is as follows:

The related capitalized lease obligations were $898,000 and $1,817,000 at 
May 28, 1994 and May 29, 1993, respectively.  These obligations and the
scheduled annual repayments are included with long-term debt.

Future minimum rental commitments for all noncancelable operating leases, 
exclusive of taxes and insurance, are as follows:

             Fiscal Years Ending        (In Thousands)
             -------------------        --------------
                    1995                   $22,469

                    1998                     6,935
                    1999                     3,666
                 Thereafter                  6,790

                                           $69,784
                                           =======

Net rental expense under operating leases was $27,435,000, $26,137,000
and $24,081,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The majority
of the operating leases contain renewal options for varying periods.  
Certain capital and operating leases include purchase options during or 
at the end of the lease term.

The Company is subject to various routine legal proceedings, environmental
actions and other matters in the ordinary course of business, some of which
may be covered in whole or in part by insurance.  In management's opinion,
none of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position.


4.  Income Taxes

rate is as follows:

During fiscal 1992, deferred income taxes were provided for timing differences
in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting
purposes.  In fiscal 1992, the largest component of deferred taxes was a
$1,232,000 deferred tax benefit resulting from fixed asset depreciation, net
of retirement gains/losses.


5.  Employee Benefit Plans

The 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is noncompensatory, allows all
eligible employees to purchase common stock of the Company.  The common stock
can be either issued by the Company at market prices or purchased on the open
market.  At May 28, 1994, 116,000 shares were authorized but not issued under
this plan.

The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible
employees not covered by union plans.  Contributions are based upon a 
percentage of annual compensation plus a percentage of voluntary employee
contributions.  Retirement expense related to this plan was $6,352,000,
$5,955,000 and $5,789,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

There are also in effect numerous negotiated pension plans covering employees
participating by reason of union contracts.  Expense for these plans was
$27,276,000, $27,289,000 and $26,566,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Information regarding assets and accumulated benefits of these
plans has not been made available to the Company.

In addition to providing retirement pension benefits, the Company provides
health care benefits for eligible retired employees.  Effective at the
beginning of fiscal 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", whereby the cost
of such postretirement benefits is accrued during the employee's active
service period.  The Company elected to immediately recognize the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation rather than amortize it over future periods. 
The cost of providing these benefits was previously recognized on a pay-as-
you-go basis and amounted to $1,049,000 for fiscal 1992.

The cumulative effect of this accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal
1993 was to decrease net income by $14,121,000 ($.67 per share), net of a 
deferred income tax benefit of $8,655,000.

Under the Company's plans, all nonunion employees, with 10 years of service
after age 50, are eligible for retiree health care coverage between ages 60
and 65.  Grandfathered nonunion employees and certain union employees who have
bargained into the Company-sponsored health care plans are generally eligible
after age 55, with 10 years of service, and have only supplemental benefits
after Medicare eligibility is reached.  Certain of the plans require
contributions by retirees and/or spouses.

The components of the net postretirement benefit expense are as follows:

In determining the APBO, the weighted average discount rate for fiscal 1994
was assumed to be 7.0%, a change from the 8.0% used in fiscal 1993.  The
assumed health

<PAGE>
care cost trend rate for fiscal 1994 was 9.5%, declining
gradually to 6.0% over the next 10 years and to 5.0% after 20 years. A 1.0% 
increase in this assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the
service and interest cost components of the net postretirement benefit expense
for fiscal 1994 by approximately $464,000, as well as increase the May 28,
1994 APBO by approximately $4,970,000.

The Company also participates in a number of multi-employer plans which
provide postretirement health care benefits to substantially all union
employees not covered by Company-administered plans.  Amounts reflected as
benefit cost and contributed to such plans, including amounts related to
health care benefits for active employees, totaled $40,467,000 and $40,287,000
in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.


6.  Stock Option Plans

The 1991 Stock Option Plan allows the Company to grant to employees stock
options to purchase up to 1,032,000 shares of common stock at prices which are
not less than the fair market value at the date of grant.  These
options may be granted over a period not to exceed ten years and are currently
exercisable from one to five years after the date of grant. The changes in
outstanding options are as follows:

of the Offering, after deducting applicable issuance costs and expenses, were 
$233,589,000.  The proceeds were used 

                                       23

to repay $134,096,000 of senior 
subordinated notes, plus accrued interest, and to redeem, at their liquidation 
value of $98,315,000, all three series of minority interest - redeemable 
preferred stocks, plus accrued dividends.

Concurrent with the Offering, the Company (i) replaced its existing bank
credit facility, (ii) exchanged $79,000,000 of 12.50% subordinated notes for a 
like amount of 10.00% senior notes, (iii) approved an increase in the 
authorized common stock to 25,000,000 shares, (iv) declared a 1-for-1.92868 
reverse stock split and (v) issued 181,000 shares of common stock in exchange 
for certain outstanding stock performance units.

In the first quarter of fiscal 1992, the Company incurred an extraordinary
charge of $10,176,000 (net of an income tax benefit of $6,184,000) related to
additional interest payments and the write-off of unamortized deferred
financing charges in connection with the retirement of debt.


11.  Subsequent Event

On June 13, 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets and
liabilities of Fuchs Baking Co. ("Fuchs"), Miami, Florida.  Fuchs, which has
annual sales of approximately $50,000,000, produces and distributes bakery
products throughout central and southern Florida.  The acquisition, which was
financed through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit agreement, will
be accounted for as a purchase.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                   ----------------------------------------

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Interstate
Bakeries Corporation and its subsidiaries as of May 28, 1994 and May 29, 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 28,
1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Interstate Bakeries Corporation
and its subsidiaries as of May 28, 1994 and May 29, 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in
the period ended May 28, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
