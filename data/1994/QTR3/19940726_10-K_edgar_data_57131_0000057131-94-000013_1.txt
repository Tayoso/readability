                                     PART I
    
    Item 1. Business
    
         The information required in Part I, Item 1, sections (a), (b) is
    contained in the Registrant's Annual Report, as shown in Exhibit I pages 1 
    thru 7, and is incorporated herein by reference.
    
    
    (c)(1)(i) Principal Products
    
         The Registrant operates in the furniture industry and as such does
    not have differing segments. "Residential" dealers are those who resell
    to individuals for their home use. "Contract" seating and casegood
    products are sold to commercial dealers.  Additional information
    regarding products and market share data is contained in the
    Registrant's Annual Report, as shown in Exhibit I page 22, and is 
    incorporated herein by reference.
    

    (c)(1)(ii) Status of New Products or Segments
    
        There were not any major new products or segments during the 1994 
     fiscal year.
    
    
    (c)(1)(iii) Raw Materials 
    
        The principal raw materials used by the Registrant in the
    manufacture of its products are hardwoods for solid wood dining room
    and bedroom furniture, casegoods, occasional tables and for the frame
    components of seating units; plywood and chipwood for internal parts; 
    veneers for dining room furniture, wall units, and occasional tables;
    water-based and liquid finishes (stains, sealants, lacquers) for
    external wood; steel for the mechanisms; leather, cotton, wool,
    synthetic and vinyl fabrics for covers; and polyester batting and
    non-chlorofluorocarbonated polyurethane foam for cushioning. Steel and
    wood products are generally purchased from a number of sources, usually
    in the vicinity of the particular plant, and product-covering fabrics
    and polyurethane are purchased from a substantial number of sources on
    a centralized basis.  The Registrant fabricates the majority of the
    parts in its products, largely because quality parts made to its exact
    specifications are not obtainable at reasonable cost from outside
    sources.
    
         Raw materials costs historically have been about 35 percent of net
    sales in the upholstery operations and a somewhat higher percentage in
    the casegoods operations. Purchased fabric (which includes leather) is 
    the largest single raw material cost representing about 40 percent of total 
    upholstery product material costs. Polyurethane (poly) foam for cushions 
    and padding and lumber are the next two largest types of upholstery raw 
    material costs.  Both fabric and poly are highly sensitive to changes in 
    the price of oil. Price increases for raw materials excluding lumber have
    kept pace with the inflation rate in recent years and are expected to 
    continue to do so. Lumber prices have increased during the past year by 
    about 10 to 20 percent, depending on the species of lumber.
    


                                    - 1 -
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
        Lumber, like most commodities, historically has had sharp changes in 
    prices over the short term and long term.  The Registrant is usually not as 
    affected by these changes as much as other furniture manufacturers due to
    the large percentage of upholstered goods manufactured that do not require
    as much lumber as casegoods.  Also, wood substitutes, (e.g. steel, plastic)
    can be used to some degree in upholstered products.   


    (c)(1)(iv) Patents, Licenses and Franchises or Concessions 
    
         The Registrant has a number of patents on its reclining chair and
    rocking chair  mechanisms which it believes were important to the early
    success of the Registrant and  to its present competitive position.  It
    believes, however, that since it is so firmly established in the
    industry, the loss of any single or small group of patents would not
    now materially or adversely affect the Registrant's business.  The 
    Registrant has no material licenses, franchises or concessions.
    

    (c)(1)(v) Seasonal Business
    
         The Registrant generally experiences its lowest level of sales
    during the first quarter.  When possible, the scheduling of production
    is designed to maintain generally uniform manufacturing activity
    throughout the year, except for mid summer plant shutdowns to coincide 
    with slower sales.
    

    (c)(1)(vi) Practices Regarding Working Capital Items
    
         The Registrant does not carry significant amounts of upholstered
    finished goods inventory to meet rapid delivery requirements of
    customers or to assure itself of a continuous allotment of goods from
    suppliers.  Normal customer terms provide for one payment due within 45
    days with a 1 percent discount within 30 days (one installment, 1
    percent discount 30 net 45).
    
         Most casegoods finished goods inventories are built to provide for
    quicker delivery requirements of customers without installment credit
    terms therefore, resulting in higher levels of finished product on hand
    at any period in time than the upholstered products.  Kincaid and
    Hammary divisions primarily sell casegood products. Casegoods are also
    sold through the Contract Division.
    
    
    (c)(1)(vii) Customers
    
         The Registrant distributes to over 12,000 locations.  The
    Registrant does not have any customer whose sales amount to 10 percent
    or more of the Registrant's consolidated sales.  The Registrant's
    approximate dealer mix consists of 39 percent  proprietary, 15 percent 
    to major dealers (Montgomery Ward and other department stores) and
    46 percent to general dealers.
    
         Proprietary stores consist of stores dedicated to the sale of 
    La-Z-Boy products and in-store dedicated galleries.  The dedicated stores
    include La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores and Showcase Shoppes.  In- 
    store dedicated galleries have been established for each of the Company's
    divisions.

    (c)(1)(viii) Orders and Backlog
    
         It has been determined that the majority of the Registrant's
    Residential Division orders were for dealer stock, with approximately 35
    percent of orders being requested directly  by customers.  Furthermore, 
    about 20 percent of units produced at all divisions were built for the
    Registrant's inventory.  The remainder were "built-to-order" for dealers.  
    
         As of July 2, 1994, backlogs were approximately $73 million compared 
    to approximately $77 million on June 26, 1993.  This represents less than
    six weeks of sales.  On average, orders are shipped in approximately five
    weeks.  Any measure of backlog at a point in time may not be indicative of  
    future sales performance.  The Registrant does not rely on backlogs to 
    predict future sales since the sales cycle is only five weeks and backlog
    can change a lot from week to week.

         The decrease in backlogs from 1993 to 1994 can be attributed largely
    to the unusually high backlog of orders at the end of 1993.  At that time 
    the furniture industry was emerging from a four year recession and the
    Registrant had just introduced many new products, such as the American
    Home Collection.
    
         The cancellation policy for La-Z-Boy Chair Company, in general,
    is that an order  cannot be cancelled after it has been put into
    production.  Orders from prebuilt stock though, may be cancelled up to the 
    time of shipment.       
    
    
    (c)(1)(ix) Renegotiation Contracts
    
         The Registrant does not have any material portion of business
    which may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of
    contracts or subcontracts at the election of the Government.
    
    
    (c)(1)(x) Competitive Conditions
    
         The Registrant believes that it ranks third in the U.S. in dollar
    volume of  sales within the Residential furniture industry, which
    includes manufacturers of bedroom, dining room and living room
    furniture.  Based on the most accurate statistics available, the
    Registrant believes that it is the largest manufacturer of upholstered 
    products and solid wood bedroom/dining room products in the United
    States.
    
         The Registrant competes primarily by emphasis on quality of its
    products, dealer  support and a lifetime warranty on the reclining and
    legrest mechanisms.
    
         The Registrant has approximately fifteen major competitors in the
    reclining or motion chair field and a substantially larger number of
    competitors in the upholstery business as a whole and in the Casegoods
    and Contract businesses.
    
         The Registrant's best U.S. market share information (in dollars,
    not units)  indicates that it has about 30 to 35 percent of the
    recliner market, above 8 percent of  the residential upholstery market,
    and less than 2 percent of the residential  casegoods market.  These
    market shares have been increasing slightly over the last three years 
    in most lines.

    (c)(1)(xi)  Research & Developement

         The Registrant spent $6.4 million in fiscal 1994 for new product
    development,  existing product improvement, quality control,
    improvement of current manufacturing  operations and research into the
    use of new materials in the construction of its  products.  The
    Registrant spent $6.2 million in fiscal 1993 on such activities and 
    $5.5 million on such activities in fiscal 1992.  The Registrant's
    customers do not engage in research with respect to the Registrant's
    products.
    
    
     (c)(1)(xii) Compliance with Environmental Regulations
    
         The Registrant believes that its capital expenditures, earnings
    and competitive position will not be materially affected by ongoing "de
    minimus level" potentially responsible party (PRP) activities at three
    clean-up sites, and that they will not be affected as a result of
    maintaining necessary compliance with federal, state or local
    environmental regulations.
    
         The Registrant has kept abreast of ongoing activities at the three
    clean-up sites.  Over the past year, the costs to the Registrant La-Z-Boy
    have been in keeping with its established status as a de minimus party,
    and have been minor.  For the future, ongoing costs at two of the sites
    (Caldwell Systems - North Carolina RCRA closure;  Organic Chemical -
    Michigan NPL site closure) are projected to remain the same. 
    Activities at the third site (Seaboard Chemical - North Carolina RCRA
    closure),  have now been completed for the first phase.  It is
    anticipated that a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS)
    will be performed to define activities required for subsequent clean-up
    phases.  Until the RI/FS is completed, and a remedy selected, it is not
    possible to estimate the costs for this activity.  However, the volume
    of material generated and sent to this site by all the Registrant's 
    facilities is less than one-quarter of one percent of the total volume of
    hazardous wastes accounted for at this site.  On this basis, we would
    reasonably anticipate that future activities will not have a
    significant effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
    position.
    
         The Registrant's current environmental compliance concerns are focused
    on new regulations for Storm Water Pollution Prevention and the 1990
    Clean Air Act Amendments.  The Registrant has participated in a group storm
    water permit program sponsored by its trade association (American
    Furniture Manufacturers Association - AFMA); has contracted with a
    consulting firm to provide assistance to its plants with the
    development of Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans; and has
    contracted with another firm to conduct detailed air emission
    inventories and assist in the preparation of timely and complete
    operating permits for Clean Air Act compliance.  The Registrant feels that
    compliance with these issues is important for maintaining its ongoing
    operations and competitive position.  The Registrant does not anticipate
    that this compliance effort will have a significant effect on capital 
    expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
    

    (c)(1)(xiii) Number of Employees 
    
         The Registrant and its subsidiaries employed 9,370 persons as of
    April 30, 1994 and 8,724 persons as of April 24, 1993.

    (d)  Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and 
         Export Sales.
    
         The Registrant does not make any material amount of sales of
    upholstered furniture to foreign customers.  The Registrant sells
    upholstered furniture to Canadian customers through its Canadian
    subsidiary, La-Z-Boy Canada Limited.
    
         The Registrant also derives an insignificant amount of royalty
    revenues from the sale and licensing of its trademarks, tradenames and
    patents to certain foreign manufacturers. 
    
         Export sales are increasing, but no specific sales objectives have 
    been set at this time.
    
    
    Item 2. Properties
    
         In the United States, the Registrant operates twenty-three
    manufacturing plants (most with warehousing space), has an automated
    fabric processing center and divisional and corporate offices.  The
    Registrant has one manufacturing plant in Canada.
    
         The location of these plants, the approximate floor space,
    principal operations conducted and the approximate number of employees
    at such locations as of April 30, 1994 are as follows:

    To the Board of Directors of
    La-Z-Boy Chair Company
    
    
    Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our 
    report dated June 2, 1994 appearing in Exhibit I on page 9, of the 1994 
    Annual Report to Shareholders of La-Z-Boy Chair Company (which report and
    consolidated  financial statements are incorporated by reference in
    this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included an audit of the
    Financial Statement Schedules listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K. 
    In our opinion, these Financial Statement Schedules present fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
    conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

    NOTE: Land improvements, buildings and building fixtures, machinery and
          equipment, information systems and other are depreciated using
          primarily accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of
          the assets as follows:
    
                                                      Years
                   Land improvements                   20
                   Buildings and building fixture   15 to 30
                   Machinery and equipment             10
                   Information systems                  5
                   Other                             3 to 10
    
    (1):  The other adjustments column reflects a non-cash write-up of
          assets previously written down in fiscal year 1988.  These assets
          are physically still in use, therefore $3,639 in installed cost
          and $3,361 in accumulated depreciation was added back.  The net
          book value write-up of $278 was recognized as a credit to
          depreciation expense and a debit to accumulated depreciation in
          fiscal year 1992 and is not shown in this 10-K but is included in
          the cash flow statement.

                                  ANNUAL REPORT

                             To La-Z-Boy Shareholders

Fiscal 1994 was an exceptional year for La-Z-Boy.  Sales increased at a faster
rate than sales for the furniture industry as a whole, and rose 18 percent to
$805 million - a new record.
				
Operating profit, net income, and earnings per share all achieved new records.

In mid-year, the Board of Directors approved a 13 percent increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend, raising dividends paid to a new high.

At year's end, our ratio of total debt to capital had been reduced to just 17.4
percent.  

Operating profit as a percent of sales increased to 7.5 percent from 6.8 percent
last year.  Our goal for 1995 is to improve again.  An allied goal is to have
operating profit, interest income and other income reach at least 20 percent of
beginning capital.  This year we reached 19.4 percent.

We are making strong progress by following a strategic plan that focuses on 
actions to generate additional value to consumers, to our retailers, and to you
- - - our shareholders.			

Contributing factors.  Sales increases have met or exceeded our expectations for
six consecutive quarters.  As the result of good planning, we've had the 
production capacity to meet rising retail demand.

Modifications to the manufacturing flow at our plants are resulting in 
increases in productivity.

To strengthen our contract business - furniture for offices, hotels and motels,
and healthcare - we consolidated the RoseJohnson Division and the La-Z-Boy
Contract Division into a single operating unit called the Contract Furniture
Group.  This is expected to have a positive effect on operating costs.

The Residential Division's broad spectrum of upholstered furniture generates 
about 70 percent of total La-Z-Boy sales.  Performance this year was outstanding
in terms of sales, profits, and customer service.  La-Z-Boy Canada, which also 
produces residential upholstered products, also posted significant sales and 
profit increases.  Residential Division marketing programs reinforce a vital
asset: La-Z-Boy is the furniture industry's best-recognized and most-trusted 
brand name.

The Hammary and Kincaid Divisions also recorded outstanding sales in fiscal 
1994, as well as profit improvements.  Hammary produces high-quality wall 
systems and occasional furniture.  Kincaid is a best-selling brand of better-
quality, solid-wood bedroom, dining room and occasional furniture.  Acquired
several years ago, both divisions now are prospering.  Their success validates 
our original expectations.

The unique response of La-Z-Boy to America's consumers.  What enabled La-Z-Boy 
to grow and remain profitable during years of recession?  How has La-Z-Boy 
increased its share of a fiercely competitive marketplace?  Why will you now 
find our products in some of America's finest homes?  And why do La-Z-Boy 
proprietary dealers experience above-average dollar sales per square foot?

                                     - 1 -

The fundamental answer is that La-Z-Boy is redefining the way the residential 
furniture industry does business.  It revolves around our response to the 
motivations of America's consumers.  This is the focal point of our discussion
in The Year In Review section of this report.

Noteworthy events.  Marvin J. Baumann, Vice President, Product Planning and
Development, retired after serving La-Z-Boy for more than 30 years.  Examine our
product engineering, observe the reliability and safety tests our products must 
endure, or watch new designs flash to life on our computer screens, and you will
be witnessing some of Marv Baumann's many contributions to our Company.

He also trained a fine cadre of younger engineering managers.  We have selected
one of them, David J. Westerndorf, to succeed Mr. Baumann.

Courtney A. Leckler, Vice President, La-Z-Boy West, also elected to retire this 
year.  His career with La-Z-Boy spanned 47 years, a length of distinguished 
service second only to that of La-Z-Boy co-founder Edwin J. Shoemaker.  Larry A.
Woolace, formerly Director of Manufacturing Services, was named General Manager,
La-Z-Boy West.

Former DuPont executive Rocco J. Losito joined La-Z-Boy as Corporate Director of
Quality Assurance.  Mr. Losito is formalizing and strengthening our corporate-
wide quality management program.  He reports directly to the Executive 
Committee.

We have adopted a bonus plan covering most plant and non-management salaried
employees.  It is based on several factors including the Company's 
profitability, plant productivity, and customer satisfaction.

Employee participation in the Matched Retirement Savings Plan 401(k) was 
inaugurated January 1, 1990 and has grown to well over 70 percent of eligible
employees this year.  This plan is in addition to our Company's salaried and 
hourly employee retirement programs.

Fortune magazine again listed La-Z-Boy as one of America's most-admired 
corporations.  We moved up 21 positions on the "Fortune 500" list of largest 
industrial fims.  In addition, La-Z-Boy was honored with the first ARROS (Annual
Retailer Reader Opinion Survey) Award for best overall product in the upholstery
category by Furniture Retailer, the magazine published by the National Home 
Furnishings Association.  The award recognizes product innovation, opportunity 
for dealers to influence product development, and consistent product quality. 

We became a "partner" in the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Lights 
Program for voluntary pollution-prevention and energy conservation.  As a Green
Lights partner, over the next several years, La-Z-Boy will install special, 
energy-efficient lighting covering more than half of our square footage.

The year ahead.  Assuming continued economic improvement, fiscal 1995 should be
another record sales year for La-Z-Boy.  If so, it will mark 14 consecutive 
years of sales growth.

We look forward to increases in sales and earnings.  Realistically, however, we
should not expect percentage improvements to equal those in fiscal 1994 because
this year's percentage gains were well above the norm.

An expanded advertising schedule will see La-Z-Boy return to network television.

The Residential Division will open additional La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries 
stores and upgrade a number of La-Z-Boy Showcase Shoppes to the Furniture
Galleries level.  The first La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store in Canada opens
in Calgary, Alberta.  The Contract Furniture Group, Hammary, and Kincaid will 
also open additional galleries of their own.

Capital expenditures are expected to exceed this year's level, and include the
costs of replacing one older upholstery plant with a new and larger one, and 
constructing a new Data Center headquarters in Monroe, Michigan.

With the support of our employees, our retailers, and our shareholders, we will
keep strengthening our Company's position as the leading supplier of furniture
for families and for businesses that appreciate quality, value, comfort, style,
and service.

                              La-Z-Boy At A Glance

America's Favorite name in furniture.  La-Z-Boy is the nation's leading 
manufacturer of upholstered seating, and the third largest manufacturer of 
residential furniture overall.  La-Z-Boy perfected the upholstered recliner and
dominates the marketplace for this class of product.  The Company has grown into
a complete furniture resource for family rooms, living rooms, bedrooms and
dining rooms.

Most La-Z-Boy furniture retails in a broad middle-price range.  Certain 
products target higher-income purchasers.  At all price levels, La-Z-Boy 
furniture represents exceptional value.

According to independent surveys, La-Z-Boy is the best-recognized and most-
trusted name in residential furniture.  This well-earned reputation is helping
La-Z-Boy expand its presence in offices, hotels, and healthcare facilities.

La-Z-Boy employs 9,370 people.  It operates 24 plants in the United States and
Canada.  The Company's La-Z-Boy, Hammary and Kincaid brand-name furniture is 
sold through over 10,000 retail locations.  Additionally, La-Z-Boy products are
manufactured under license in Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Great
Britain and South Africa.

The Company's shares are listed on the New York and the Pacific Stock Exchanges.

La-Z-Boy Divisions, Products and Markets:

La-Z-Boy Residential accounts for about 70 percent of total Company sales. 
Principal products include stationary chairs, sofas and loveseats, recliners, 
reclining sofas, sleep sofas, and modular seating groups.  Residential Division
furniture is sold in a national network of La-Z-Boy proprietary stores, and in
better-quality department stores, furniture stores and regional furniture 
chains.

La-Z-Boy Canada manufactures residential seating and markets La-Z-Boy 
residential products in Canada.  This division is initiating a Canadian network
of La-Z-Boy proprietary retail stores.

Hammary produces occasional tables, living room cabinets, wall entertainment 
units, and upholstered furniture sold in quality furniture and department 
stores.  Hammary also produces CompaTables occasional tables which are featured
in La-Z-Boy proprietary stores.

Kincaid makes solid-wood bedroom, dining room and occasional furniture sold 
through in-store Kincaid Galleries, select La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores
and better-quality stores nationally.

La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group includes three sales entities:

La-Z-Boy Business Furniture - Executive office and general office seating, 
desks, cabinets and conference tables, plus a complete line of modular office 
components are sold by office furniture dealers.  Full-office furniture systems
and office seating are marketed through contract furniture dealers, interior
designers, architects, and institutional buyers.

La-Z-Boy Healthcare Furniture - Products include hospital chairs, recliners, and
special mobile recliners for easy patient mobility in the hospital or home.  
Healthcare furniture is marketed through contract dealers and medical sales 
companies.

La-Z-Boy Hospitality Furniture - Specially engineered La-Z-Boy recliners are 
sold directly to major hotel and motel chains and through hospitality sales 
companies.   

                              The Year In Review

A strategy for success in a changing industry.  Many furniture manufacturers use
retailers as channels for "pushing" products to market.  These manufacturers 
often must resort to short-lived incentives that encourage retailers to sell 
without regard for consumers' needs.  This strategy reveals little knowledge of
today's homemakers and the kind of positive shopping experience they want.

La-Z-Boy markets to consumers.  We address their interests.  We provide them
with good reasons for purchasing.  Consequently, consumers exert "pull" that 
moves our products through our dealers' stores.

How well does the La-Z-Boy "pull" strategy work?  Consumer-directed advertising
has helped make La-Z-Boy the best-known name in furniture.  According to 
independent research, our brand name has a better than 95 percent awareness
factor.  In terms of advertising recall, we outperform our nearest competitor 
4-to-1.

Equally important, independent research says consumers associate the La-Z-Boy
name with key preference factors such as product quality, and comfort and 
durability, plus honest representation and fairness in selling.

Being consumer-directed has helped us attract more categories of consumers.  
For higher-income, more-sophisticated consumers, we developed La-Z-Boy Classics
stationary chairs and recliners, and the American Home Collection by La-Z-Boy -
a beautiful selection of stationary furniture for living rooms.  We added built-
in tables and storage to our La-Z-Time Motion Modulars seating groups to make
them more useful in smaller homes.  We engineered basic chairs and sofas to fit 
younger families' budgets.

Thanks to our consumer research, we launched La-Z-Boy into a soaring new market 
for motion sofas, motion loveseats, and motion modular groupings.  The 
exclusive, patented recliner features used on many of these La-Z-Boy products 
make them even more appealing.

"Who built all this beautiful, comfortable furniture?," asks an eight-page 
advertisement in leading shelter magazines.  Readers see an extraordinary range
of stylish furniture and accessories photographed in American homes.  Surprise!
These are all La-Z-Boy products - proof that La-Z-Boy has become a complete
furniture resource.

This special advertisement offers a free La-Z-Boy product portfolio plus a 
brochure of decorating tips and ideas.  In less than two months, over 40,000 
consumers called our 1-800-Then Relax number.  Consumers appreciate ideas and 
thoughtful assistance that only an industry leader like La-Z-Boy can provide.

The reasons why La-Z-Boy is the industry leader become clear when you visit a 
La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store.  The array of furniture, and the way 
La-Z-Boy correlates form with function, and beauty with practicality, suprises 
many people.  Over 70 percent of today's consumer-directed La-Z-Boy product 
line has been introduced within the past three years.

But it takes more than this to make our "pull" strategy successful.  As part of
a fundamental business strategy, La-Z-Boy is redefining the way the furniture 
industry does business.

A new kind of purchasing experience.  Two decades ago, consumers began 
discovering dedicated furniture stores called La-Z-Boy Showcase Shoppes. 
Showcase Shoppes introduced legions of consumers to La-Z-Boy.

Today, a new generation of stores - La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries - shows why 
La-Z-Boy has become the American consumer's principal resource for family room 
and living room furniture.

These large, inviting stores feature settings of upholstered furniture, wall 
cabinets and entertainment systems, tables and occasional furniture - all made 
by La-Z-Boy.  Fascinating accessories from around the world complement the 
presentation.  First-time shoppers are astounded at this wealth of choice.

But what keeps them coming back?  After all, research studies say consumers 
don't enjoy shopping for furniture.  They find it frustrating, even stressful.

Shopping in a La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store is a different experience - 
eye-opening, pressure-free, reassuring, even enjoyable.  The reason is that
La-Z-Boy and its retailers are partners in service to the consumer.

For example:

 - Professional sales training programs and seminars help our stores serve
   consumers' interests and, at the same time, increase their sales volumes and
   operational efficiency.

 - Authorized La-Z-Boy retailers have access to an arsenal of consumer 
   education, point-of-sale, advertising and other sales support materials.

 - With the La-Z-Boy Screen Test Video Catalog System, shoppers can see 
   furniture being "electronically upholstered" in any authorized covering, 
   while salespeople receive up-to-the-minute information about pricing and
   product availability.

 - Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) technology lets La-Z-Boy retailers enter
   customer orders and get answers without delay so they can spend more time
   with customers, less time on paperwork.  It also gives our retailers current
   information for standardized financial reporting, business analyses, and
   planning, to help them maximize their profitability.

 - New bar coding software links each item in the manufacturing stream to the 
   retailer's original order.  This helps La-Z-Boy retailers control their 
   inventories, make on-time deliveries, and improve cash flow.

   La-Z-Boy is a leader in the furniture industry in combining research, 
   education and technology so that retailers can do a consistently better job 
   of serving consumers. 

Defining the future of furniture retailing.  Many La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries
stores experience 50 to 100 percent higher sales revenues per square foot than
the average conventional furniture store.  Our top-20 superstores have annual 
sales of $3 million or more each.

Over the past 10 years, on average, La-Z-Boy sales have increased almost 12
percent annually, or more than double the average rate of increase for the
residential furniture industry.

At the same time, our market share has increased.  We are attracting higher-
income families, plus a rapidly increasing share of mid-life consumers - the 
biggest per capita purchasers of home furnishings.

The gallery concept, especially as it is expressed in La-Z-Boy Furniture 
Galleries stores, is the foundation of a success strategy that defines the 
future of La-Z-Boy and of our industry.   
    
                            Highlights of Operations

The Residential Division continues to expand and upgrade its proprietary 
distribution network.  Soon, some 100 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores will 
be serving major metropolitan areas.  These stores are augmented by La-Z-Boy 
Showcase Shoppes, most of which are scheduled for upgrading to Furniture
Galleries; and in smaller communities, by a La-Z-Boy Gallery within independent
furniture stores.

Newer products were best-sellers in fiscal 1994.  Major sales gains were scored
by the American Home Collection of luxurious stationary living room furniture, 
and by motion modulars seating groups featuring "home theater" arrangements, 
hideaway storage, snack trays and reclining end units.  Entry-level reclining 
chairs, upscale La-Z-Boy Classics chairs, and our new reclining sofas also 
proved highly popular.  In these categories, sales increases ranged from 30 
percent to well over 200 percent.

Hammary sales moved up sharply as the division restructured its product lines 
for longer-term market appeal.  Teams of workers focused on manufacturing
efficiencies and customer service.

Hammary modular home theater systems successfully address a fast-growing segment
of the home furnishings market.  They feature large-screen television enclosures
flanked by matching pier cabinets for housing stereo receivers, allied
electronics and surround-sound speakers.

Kincaid repositioned its product lines to equal the styling and quality offered 
by premium brand names, but at lower prices.




                                     - 6 -

Among more than 100 new pieces introduced this year, the Kincaid top-seller was
the Cherry Mountain III Collection that replicates the Queen Anne period's 
elegance and delicacy.  Crafted in solid cherry, this collection includes an 
extensive selection of bedroom and dining room furniture; plus wardrobes, home 
entertainment centers, wall storage and display systems, and occasional tables.

Kincaid is adding 150 dealers to its base of better-quality furniture stores and
major regional retail chains.  Many of these retailers operate in-store Kincaid
Galleries.

The Contract Furniture Group now manages all La-Z-Boy business, healthcare and
hospitality furniture, as well as custom office systems.  Resulting efficiencies
are having positive effects on product development, sales and customer service.

The Group is experiencing demand at both ends of the price spectrum.  Several
luxurious new chair styles are being introduced to complement the Group's 
collections of executive desks, credenzas, conference tables and shelf units. 
Growth in small businesses and home-based enterprises is spurring demand for the
Group's attractively priced, highly efficient modular office units.

The Contract Furniture Group is expanding its own gallery program.  A typical 
in-store La-Z-Boy Business Furniture Gallery provides a 1,200 square foot or 
larger dedicated display area, and generates two to four times the sales revenue
of conventional selling space.

Engineering and Manufacturing activities have focused on quality assurance, 
plant utilization and mechanical redesign.

Our Total Quality Management program is now being formalized with the 
appointment of a corporate director of quality assurance.  Our objective is to 
integrate quality-related disciplines in all operations.  This will range from
statistical process control and new measurement systems to supplier 
relationships that emphasize continuous quality improvement.

Revisions to manufacturing operations, now largely complete, are improving our 
product flow and helping us expedite deliveries.  Construction was started in 
March to build a 396,000 square foot major upholstery plant to replace a 
smaller existing plant.  Completion is expected this fall.

Product re-engineering efforts will help us employ alternative materials, 
especially metal, for cost-efficiency and production flexibility.  A more 
powerful computer-aided design (CAD) system capable of 3-D solids modeling, 
stress analysis and collaborative engineering will make our design operations
more productive.

Through advances in all areas - consumer-directed marketing, product 
development, manufacturing and distribution - we have positioned La-Z-Boy for
continuing growth and higher profitability.

                                Price Waterhouse        

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of La-Z-Boy Chair Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in shareholders'
equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
La-Z-Boy Chair Company and its subsidiaries at April 30, 1994 and April 24,
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended April 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the             
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on April 25,
1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements                 

Note 1:  Accounting Policies

The Company operates in the furniture industry.  The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial
statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of La-Z-Boy Chair
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany 
transactions have been eliminated.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Items capitalized, including significant betterments to existing facilities,
are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is computed using primarily accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

In April 1991 the Company entered into a $50 million unsecured revolving 
credit line (Credit Agreement) to extend through August 31, 1998, requiring 
interest payments only through August 31, 1994 and periodic payments of       
principal and interest through 1998.  The Company is in the process of 
renewing the Credit Agreement to require interest only payments through 
August 1999 and to require principal payment in August 1999.  The Credit        
Agreement also includes covenants that, among other things, require the
Company to maintain certain financial statement ratios.  The Company has
complied with all of the requirements.

Proceeds from industrial revenue bonds were used to finance the construction
of manufacturing facilities.  These arrangements require the Company to insure
and maintain the facilities and make annual payments that include interest.
The bonds are secured by the facilities constructed from the bond proceeds.

Maturities on debt obligations for the five years subsequent to April 30,
1994 are $3 million, $2 million, $3 million, $2 million and $3 million, 
respectively.  As of April 30, 1994, the Company had remaining unused lines  
of credit and commitments of $60 million under several credit arrangements.

The Company's shareholders have adopted Restricted Share Plans under which the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors was 
authorized to offer for sale up to an aggregate of 650,000 common shares to
certain employees and non-employee directors at 25% of the fair market value 
of the shares.  The plans require that all shares be held in an escrow account
for a period of three years in the case of an employee, or until the
participant's service as a director ceases in the case of a director.  In the
event of an employee's termination during the escrow period, the shares must
be sold back to the Company at the employee's cost. 

Shares aggregating 11,800 and 14,450 were granted and issued during the fiscal
years 1994 and 1993, respectively, under the Restricted Share Plans.  Shares
remaining for future grants under the above plans amounted to 442,075 at
April 30, 1994. 

The Company's shareholders have also adopted a Performance-Based Restricted 
Stock Plan.  This plan authorizes the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of the Board of Directors to award up to an aggregate of 400,000 shares to key
employees.  Grants of shares are based entirely on achievement of goals over 
a three-year performance period.  Any award made under the plan will be at 
the sole discretion of the Committee after judging all relevant factors.  At
April 30, 1994, performance awards were outstanding pursuant to which up to
47,000 shares and 43,520 shares may be issued in fiscal years 1996 and 1997,
respectively, depending on the extent to which certain specified performance
objectives are met.  The costs of performance awards are expensed over the
performance period.

Note 6:  Retirement

The Company has contributory and non-contributory retirement plans covering 
substantially all factory employees.  

Eligible salaried employees are covered under a trusteed profit sharing 
retirement plan.  Cash contributions to a trust are made annually based on
profits.  

The Company has established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for 
highly compensated employees called a SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan).

The Company offers a voluntary 401(k) retirement plan to eligible employees
within all U.S. operating divisions.  Currently over 70% of eligible employees
are participating in the plan.  Employee contributions are matched with 
La-Z-Boy stock at $0.50 on the dollar up to a maximum company contribution of
1% of pay.

The actuarially determined net periodic pension cost and retirement costs are
computed as follows (for the years ended):

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% for 1994 and 9.0%
for 1993 and 1992.  The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of accumulated benefit obligations was 7.5% for 1994, 8.0% for 1993 and
8.5% for 1992.  Vested benefits included in the accumulated benefit obligation
were $21 million and $17 million at April 30, 1994 and April 24, 1993,         
respectively.  Plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio that
consists primarily of debt and equity securities.  

The Company's pension plan funding policy has been to contribute annually the
maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.

Note 7:  Health Care

The 1994 gross health-care expenses increased 21% over 1993 which was a much
higher rate of increase than 1993's 7% increase over 1992, even after 
adjusting for employment increases.

Participant payments increased markedly due to premium payments for most 
employees becoming effective January 1993 making 1994 the first full payment
year.  Participant payments covered 15% of health-care expenses in 1994.

Net health-care costs in 1994 increased 14% over 1993 compared to a 3% increase
in 1993 over 1992 even though much higher participant payments occurred.

The Company makes annual provisions for any current and future retirement 
health-care costs which may not be covered by retirees' collected premiums.

Note 8:  Income Taxes

Effective April 25, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," which applies a
balance sheet approach to income tax accounting.  In accordance with the new 
standard, the balance sheet reflects the anticipated tax impact of future
taxable income or deductions implicit in the balance sheet in the form of
temporary differences.  These temporary differences reflect the difference
between the basis in assets and liabilities as measured in the financial
statements and as measured by tax laws using enacted tax rates.  On April 25,
1993, the Company recorded a tax credit of $3 million or $0.18 per share, 
which represents the net increase in the net deferred tax asset as of that 
date.  Such amount has been reflected in the consolidated statement of
income as an accounting change.  Prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.

Note 9:  Contingencies

The Company has been named as defendant in various lawsuits arising in the
normal course of business.  It is not possible at the present time to estimate
the ultimate outcome of these actions; however, management and the Company's
legal counsel believe that the resultant liability, if any, will not be
material.

The Company is also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws
and regulations.  The Company accrues for certain environmental remediation
activities related to past operations, including Superfund clean-up and Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act compliance activities, for which commitments 
have been made and reasonable cost estimates are possible.  Currently, the
Company has been determined to be a "de-minimus" level potentially responsible
party (PRP) at three clean-up sites and has provided for any known costs 
relating to these sites.  The Company is also conducting voluntary compliance
audits at Company owned facilities.  Although there probably will be future
expenditures in this area, the effect on future financial results is not
subject to reasonable estimation.  However, management does not anticipate 
that they will have a material adverse effect.

La-Z-Boy is organized into five operating divisions.  Residential (67 years in
business) accounts for the majority of the upholstery category.  Kincaid (48
years) is part of the wood category.  La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group (22
years) is all of the Contract line.  Hammary (50 years) is primarily in the
wood category.  La-Z-Boy Canada (65 years) is part of the upholstery category.

La-Z-Boy's market share of all U.S. upholstery furniture products is above 8%.

On the basis of available market share data (in dollars), La-Z-Boy has 30-35% 
of the U.S. single-seat recliner market and is the world's largest recliner
manufacturer.  (The next largest U.S. competitor holds roughly 20% of the
U.S. market.)  La-Z-Boy's sleep sofa current market share, approximately
12%, has been growing over the last three years.

Market share data by individual product lines other than recliners and sleepers
(e.g., sofas, reclining sofas, wood bedroom and dining room, wood occasional,
etc.) indicate that, although La-Z-Boy does not have a market share above 10%
in any one line, the Company's market share has been growing over the last
three years in most lines.

Analysis of Operations
Year Ended April 30, 1994
(1994 compared with 1993)

U.S. furniture industry sales increased roughly 6-8% in La-Z-Boy's fiscal 1994
over 1993.  La-Z-Boy's sales increase of 18% over 1993 continued to exceed the
increase experienced by the industry as a whole.  Approximately 2% of this
increase was due to 1994 including 53 weeks while 1993 contained 52 weeks.
The sales volume increase was largely due to improvements in the economy.
Selling price increases were generally in the 2-4% range.  Major product lines
that experienced rates of unit growth above the Company average were the
modulars, lower end recliners, sofas, reclining sofas, high end recliners and
bedroom (wood).

No divisions or companies were acquired or disposed of during the last six 
years.  Therefore, all sales growth has been internally generated.

During 1994, the La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group was formed through the
merger of the former La-Z-Boy Contract and RoseJohnson divisions.

The number of independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores continued
to grow in 1994.  Most of these stores were major upgrades or new locations
for earlier generation La-Z-Boy Showcase Shoppes.  These stores are part of 
the reason La-Z-Boy sales growth has exceeded the industry average.  In 
addition, the number of smaller in-store galleries continued to grow for all
divisions.

The gross margin (gross profit dollars as a percent of sales) of 26.2% in 1994
was up from the 26.0% gross margin in 1993.  Reasons for the improvement 
include:  the 18% sales increase covering fixed costs; the lack of some one-
time costs that affected last year relating to start-up and training for new
styles and changes to manufacturing techniques; real selling price increases
and better plant efficiencies.  These reasons for improvement more than offset
the effects of increased sales of product lines with lower-than-average gross
margins and increased lumber and health-care costs.

Other income declined in 1994 due to a reduction in interest income, changes
in pension-related assumptions and Canadian currency exchange losses.

Income tax expense as a percent of pretax income increased to 40.3% in 1994  
from 39.8% in 1993.  The effect of the 1% increase in the federal tax rate to
35% was partially offset by changes in profitability among divisions.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", which changed the method of accounting for income taxes, was adopted
by the Company effective April 25, 1993.  This change in accounting principle
increased net income and the net deferred tax asset by $3.4 million or $.18
per share.

Analysis of Operations
Year Ended April 24, 1993
(1993 compared with 1992)

La-Z-Boy's 1993 sales increase of 10% over 1992 once again exceeded the growth
in the U.S. residential furniture industry as a whole.  The 1993 sales increase
together with forecasted growth in the industry indicates that the furniture
industry recession which adversely affected results for the previous four years
has ended.  Selling price increases during 1993 were generally in the 1-3%
range.  Major product lines that experienced rates of unit sales growth above
the Company average were the reclining sofa, high end recliner, lower end
recliners, bedroom (wood) and occasional (wood) product lines.

During 1993, 18 independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores opened,
bringing the total number of stores to 63.  The rate of new store openings and
their sales volumes are meeting management's expectations.  Most of these
openings were major upgrades or new locations for earlier generation La-Z-Boy
Showcase Shoppes.

Gross margin of 26.0% in 1993 was down from the 26.9% gross margin in 1992 
even though unit volume increased.  This decline in gross margin was primarily
in the Residential division which generates roughly 70% of consolidated sales.

The Residential division gross margin declined for two main reasons.  The
primary reason was that unexpectedly high labor and overhead costs were
incurred at most plants.  These costs were primarily caused by the introduction
of new styles and efforts to improve plant methods while at the same time,
reduce inventories, improve the flexibility to handle a greater number of 
different styles, and ship dealer orders more complete and quicker than in the
past.  In addition, an anticipated unfavorable product line mix effect occurred
from selling more product lines with lower-than-average gross margins.

S,G & A expense for 1993 of 19.2% of sales was lower than last year's percentage
of 19.9% primarily due to the relatively large sales increase and a decline in
bad debt expense.

Interest expense declined $2.0 million in 1993 from 1992 due to a combination
of lower debt principal amounts and lower interest rates.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased interest income
realized from higher cash balances throughout the year more than offsetting
lower interest rates.

Income tax expense as a percent of pretax income increased to 39.8% in 1993 
from 37.1% in 1992.  In 1992, there was a one-time tax benefit from the merger
of a previously acquired division.

Liquidity and Financial Condition

Cash flows from operations amounted to $28 million in 1994, $35 million in 
1993 and $36 million in 1992 and have usually been adequate for day-to-day
expenditures, dividends to shareholders and capital expenditures.

The 1994 cash flow from operations declined $6.5 million from 1993.  Other
assets and liabilities changed from a source of cash in 1993 to a use of cash
in 1994 primarily due to the payment of income taxes.  Also, inventories 
increased $6.7 million.

Capital expenditures were $17.5 million in 1994 compared to $12.2 million for
both 1993 and 1992.  Some capacity expansions occurred in 1994 while the prior
two years did not require expansions.  Capacity utilization of about 70% at 
the end of 1994 was up from about 65% at the end of 1993.

Cash flows relating to debt caused both inflows and outflows of cash.  No new
debt was raised in the last three years.  During 1992, a $15.0 million bridge
loan was refinanced through a private placement and two industrial revenue
bonds totaling $9.7 million were refinanced at a lower interest rate.  
Retirements of debt totaled between $1 million and $15 million for each of the
last three years and are primarily related to paying down the $53 million debt
incurred in 1987 to acquire an operating division.  While the cash flow 
statement shows that $39.3 million of debt was retired in 1992, $24.7 million
relates to refinancing as described above.

In October 1987, the La-Z-Boy Board of Directors authorized a one-million 
share stock repurchase program.  In February 1993, the Board authorized the
repurchase of another one million shares.  As of April 30, 1994 and April 24,
1993, the Company had acquired about 1,010,000 and 930,000 shares, respectively,
of its own stock.  The Company plans to be in the market for its shares as
changes in its stock price and other financial opportunities arise.

The financial strength of the Company is reflected in two commonly used ratios
- - -the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) and the 
debt-to-capital ratio (total debt divided by beginning of the year shareholders'
equity plus total debt).  The current ratio at the end of 1994 and 1993 was
4.1:1 and 3.8:1, respectively.  The debt to capital ratio was 17.4% at the end
of 1994 and 18.5% at the end of 1993.

La-Z-Boy provides for all current and future potential liabilities as required
including those relating to postretirement benefits.

The Company is subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations.  The Company accrues for certain environmental remediation
activities related to past operations, including Superfund clean-up and
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act compliance activities, for which
commitments have been made and reasonable cost estimates are possible.  
Currently, the Company has been determined to be a "de-minimus" level
potentially responsible party (PRP) at three clean-up sites and has provided
for any known costs relating to these sites.  The Company is also conducting
voluntary compliance audits at Company owned facilities.

Outlook

La-Z-Boy's 1995 fiscal year to end April 29, 1995 will include 52 weeks 
compared to fiscal year 1994, which included 53 weeks.  This is approximately
a 2% reduction in the length of the year which will affect sales and other
financial comparisons from year to year.

The Company expects the economic recovery to continue through calendar year
1994.  Sales in fiscal year 1995 are expected to exceed the 1994 results but
due to the stronger than expected year in 1994, the double digit sales 
increase experienced in 1994 is not expected to repeat.

One of La-Z-Boy's financial objectives is to achieve sales increases of 10%
per year or increases at least greater than that of the furniture industry.
Some furniture industry forecasts for calendar year 1994 over 1993 are in the 
5-7% range.  For 1994, La-Z-Boy sales increased 18% over 1993.

The Company's major residential efforts and opportunities for sales growth 
greater than industry averages are focused outside the recliner market segment,
e.g., stationary upholstery (single and multi-seat), reclining sofas and
modulars, wood occasional and wall units and wood bedroom and dining room.

The newly formed La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group sales growth rate in the
next few years is expected to exceed the average of the other divisions. 
Today, this division is not generating a profit and profits are not expected
to improve in 1995 due to large research and development expenditures,
reorganization costs and start-up costs associated with the recent merger of
the two formerly separate contract divisions.  Eventually, profit margins
comparable to the Company's average rates are believed to be able to be 
achieved.  Profitability at this level would help the Company reach the 
financial goals described below even though this division is not large enough
to dramatically affect the results.

A second financial goal is to improve operating profit as a percent of sales
in 1995 compared to 1994.  For 1994, the operating profit margin was 7.5% of
sales.

A third goal is to achieve operating profit, interest income and other income  
(return) as a percent of beginning of the year capital of 20%.  For 1994, 
return on capital was 19.4%.

La-Z-Boy has an opportunity to improve its margins through increases in
efficiency, improvements in the utilization of equipment and facilities and
increases in sales volumes, even though product line growth may be in lines
with lower gross margins.

Capital expenditures are forecast to be approximately $19 to $24 million in
1995 compared to $17.5 million in 1994.  The 1995 forecast includes the
construction of a new upholstery factory in Arkansas.  The 396,000 square foot
plant is being constructed to replace an existing older 200,000 square foot
plant.  Long-term financing of the expected $7 million cost is planned to be
through the use of industrial revenue bonds.

The effect of environmental costs on future financial results is not subject
to reasonable estimation.  However, management does not anticipate that they
will have a material adverse effect.

               STOCK OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS 

      Under rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a 
person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the Company's common shares 
if he or she has or shares the right to vote the shares or if he has or 
shares the investment power over such shares. There may be, therefore, 
more than one beneficial owner with respect to any share or group of 
shares. A person may also be deemed to be the beneficial owner if he is 
the settlor of a trust with a right to revoke the trust and regain the 
shares or has the power to acquire shares by means of outstanding options 
or rights to convert other securities into common shares. 

      The following information is furnished in compliance with these 
rules with respect to security ownership of each person known to the 
Company to beneficially own more than 5% of the Company's common shares as 
of June 17, 1994, based in each case on data provided by such person.

                   COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE 
                     SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

      Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive 
officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's 
Common Stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the New York Stock 
Exchange. Executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent 
stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with 
all copies of Section 16(a) forms they file. 

      Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by 
it, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no 
Forms 5 were required for those persons, the Company believes that during 
the fiscal year ended April 30, 1994, all filing requirements were 
complied with in a timely fashion. 

                    PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 

      The Company's Board of Directors is divided into three classes, one 
consisting of three directors and two consisting of four directors. 
Directors serve for three-year, staggered terms, such that the terms of 
office of directors comprising one of the classes expires each year. This 
year, three directors are to be elected, to serve until the Company's 
annual meeting of shareholders in 1997 or until their successors are 
elected and qualified. 

      Pursuant to applicable Michigan corporate law, assuming the presence 
of a quorum, directors will be elected at the meeting from among those 
persons duly nominated for such positions by a plurality of votes cast by 
holders of the Common Stock who are present in person, or represented by 
proxy, and entitled to vote at the meeting. Thus, for this year, those 
nominees who receive the highest through third-highest numbers of votes 
for their election as directors will be elected, regardless of the number 
of votes which for any reason, including abstention, withholding of 
authority, or broker non-vote, are not cast for the election of such 
nominees.

      The Board's nominees for election as directors are the three current 
directors whose terms expire with the 1994 annual meeting. In the absence 
of other instruction, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy 
intend to vote in favor of these three nominees (or, if any such nominee 
should become unable or unwilling to serve, which is not presently 
anticipated, for such substitute nominee as is designated by the Board). 
The tables which follow provide background information concerning each of 
the Board's nominees and each other director of the Company whose term of 
office will continue beyond the 1994 annual meeting.

                                             years.  He was appointed a
                                             Director in January 1991.

                    BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES 

      Edwin J. Shoemaker and Charles T. Knabusch may be deemed to be 
persons who are in control of the Company. 

      During the Company's fiscal year ending April 30, 1994, the Board of 
Directors held ten meetings. Each director attended at least 90% of the 
total number of meetings of the Board and of all committees on which he 
served. All directors are in regular touch with the Company's affairs. 
Employee directors receive a fee of $250 for each meeting of the Board of 
Directors attended. Non-employee directors receive an annual retainer of 
$12,000 and a fee of $400 for each Board meeting and for each committee 
meeting attended. 

      In addition, each non-employee director receives an initial grant of 
30-day options on 1,500 common shares of Restricted Stock upon election to 
the Board and a subsequent annual grant at the beginning of each fiscal 
year of 30-day options on 200 common shares of Restricted Stock. Such 
grants are made pursuant to the La-Z-Boy Chair Company Restricted Stock 
Plan for Non-Employee Directors approved by the shareholders effective 
September 1, 1989. The Plan contemplates a present sale of the optioned 
shares at 25% of market value, but provides restrictions on the transfer 
or other disposition of the shares by the non-employee director during the 
restricted time, which expires upon the earliest to occur of the following 
events: death or disability, retirement from the Board, change of control, 
or termination of the participant's service as a director with the consent 
of a majority of the Company's employee members of the Board, all as 
defined in the Plan. 

      The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee and a Compensation 
Committee. 

      The Audit Committee, which held two meetings during the fiscal year, 
consists of Mr. Hehl, Chairman, and Messrs. Weaver, Gruber, Stevens and 
Lipford, all of whom are non-employee Directors. The functions of the 
Audit Committee are to recommend to the Board of Directors the firm of 
independent accountants to serve the Company each fiscal year, to review 
the scope, fees and results of the audit by independent accountants and to 
review the adequacy of the Company's system of internal accounting 
controls and the scope and results of internal auditing procedures. 

      The Compensation Committee, which held three meetings during the 
fiscal year, consists of Mr. Weaver, Chairman, and Messrs. Hehl, Gruber 
and Lipford, all non-employee directors. The functions of the Compensation 
Committee include recommending to the Board of Directors remuneration of 
the officers of the Company, recommending to the Board of Directors 
remuneration of the members of the Board and of the Board Committees, and 
the administration of the Company's executive incentive compensation and 
stock option plans. 

      The Board of Directors has no nominating committee. Nominations for 
Director are considered by the entire Board.

(3) At the close of the Company's 1994 fiscal year, the named executives 
held the following numbers of shares of restricted stock, which had the 
following aggregate values on such date (based on the closing market price 
for unrestricted shares of the Company's Common Stock): Mr. Knabusch, -0- 
shares worth $-0-; Mr. Shoemaker, $-0- shares worth $-0-; Mr. Jackson, 
7,800 shares worth $261,300; Mr. Norton, 7,800 shares worth $261,300; and 
Mr. Nocella, 1,450 shares worth $48,575. 

    The value of restricted stock listed in the Summary Compensation Table 
represents the fair market value of the Company's stock at the grant date 
less the 25% required payment for the stock by the executive. While all 
shares of restricted stock require three years of post-grant service to 
vest in the ordinary course, such shares may vest in less than three years 
in certain circumstances, such as upon a change of control of the Company 
or the holder's death, permanent mental or physical disability or normal 
retirement. Normal dividends are paid on the restricted stock and are not 
subject to forfeiture. 

(4) The amounts in this column include amounts allocated for the named 
executives to the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), earnings 
credited under the SERP, and Company matching contributions in the form of 
Company stock to the Matched Retirement Savings Plan. Set forth below is a 
breakdown of the totals contained in the Table for fiscal 1994: 

Amounts allocated to the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan of the 
Company were as follows:

(1) All of the above options were granted September 2, 1993 pursuant to 
the terms of the Company's 1986 Incentive Stock Option Plan as approved by 
the shareholders of the Company in 1986 and in effect as of the date of 
the grant. One-fourth of the shares purchasable under each option normally 
becomes exercisable beginning in the second, third, fourth and fifth years 
after the date of the grant. However, under the terms of the agreements 
described under "Certain Agreements" below, then-outstanding options would 
be accelerated upon the occurrence of a change in control. Options once 
exercisable generally remain exercisable until the expiration of the fifth 
year after the date of grant. In the event of the optionee's death or 
retirement, the right to exercise the option will exist for a period of 
one year following the date of such event for the full amount of shares 
remaining unexercised. The optionee's right to exercise an option 
immediately terminates in the event the optionee's employment terminates 
for any reason other than death or retirement. The per share exercise 
price at which the options were granted was 100% of the fair market value 
of the Company's Common Stock on the date the options were granted, except 
that in the case of options granted to Mr. Knabusch, such price was 110% 
of fair market value on the grant date. 

(2) The 5% and 10% rates of appreciation are required to be disclosed by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and are not intended to 
forecast possible future actual appreciation, if any, in the Company's 
stock prices. It is important to note that options have potential value 
for the named executive only if the Company's stock price advances beyond 
the exercise price shown in the table during the effective five-year 
option period.

                LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION UNDER THE 
         LA-Z-BOY CHAIR COMPANY 1993 PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK PLAN 

      At the 1993 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved a long-term 
incentive compensation plan designated as the La-Z-Boy Chair Company 1993 
Performance-Based Stock Plan ("Performance Plan"). The purpose of the 
Performance Plan is to provide the Company and its subsidiaries with an 
additional means to (a) attract and retain competent new personnel and 
other key employees, (b) insure retention of the services of existing 
executive personnel and key employees, and (c) provide incentive to all 
such personnel to devote their utmost effort and skills to the long-term 
advancement and betterment of the Company and its shareholders. The 
Performance Plan seeks to accomplish that purpose through the grant to 
selected employees of contingent awards ("Target Awards") the potential 
pay-outs on which ("Performance Awards") are linked to achievement by the 
end of a cycle of three Company fiscal years (a "Performance Cycle") of 
Company performance goals specified toward the beginning of the 
Performance Cycle, and by structuring all Performance Awards which may be 
earned as options to purchase or outright grants of Company Common Stock. 

      After the 1993 Annual Meeting, the Compensation Committee granted 
Target Awards to certain employees for the Performance Cycle ending at the 
close of the Company's 1996 fiscal year. In addition, shortly before the 
end of fiscal 1994, the Compensation Committee granted additional Target 
Awards for the Performance Cycle ending at the close of fiscal 1997. In 
each case, the Committee determined to establish four uniform financial 
goals for these Target Awards, each relating to operating performance of 
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the pertinent 
Performance Cycle: (1) sales growth at a rate greater than that of the 
industry, (2) an increase in earnings before income tax at a rate equal to 
or greater than sales growth, (3) operating profit margin growth at a rate 
equal to or greater than sales growth, and (4) return on total capital at 
a specified rate.

(1) Numbers reported are the base numbers of shares subject to Target 
Awards granted. 

(2) Numbers reported are the numbers of shares which would become subject 
to 30-day option if only one performance goal is achieved. The per share 
exercise price for any such option would be 50% of the "Fair Market Value" 
(as defined in the Performance Plan) of a common share at date of grant of 
the Target Awards. 

(3) Numbers reported are the numbers of shares which would become subject 
to 30-day option if two performance goals are achieved. The per share 
exercise price for each such option would be 25% of Fair Market Value of a 
common share on date of grant of the Target Awards. For achievement of 
three performance goals, an outright grant of the same number of shares 
would be made. Under the terms of the Performance Plan, if a Target Award 
grantee's employment terminates due to death, or if termination is due to 
disability (as therein defined) or retirement with the consent of the 
Company and the terminated employee subsequently dies before the end of 
the Performance Cycle, his or her estate administrator may elect to 
receive a Performance Award prior to the end of the cycle. If the election 
is made, the estate would receive either a 30-day option on the number of 
shares shown in this column, as if two Performance Goals had been met, or 
an outright grant of that number of shares, depending upon whether 
employment termination occurred during the first or second half of the 
Performance Cycle. Termination of the grantee's employment due to death, 
disability, or consensual retirement otherwise has no effect on any 
outstanding Target Awards of the grantee, but termination for any other 
reason automatically cancels such awards.

(4) Numbers reported are the numbers of shares which would be awarded, in 
the form of an outright grant, if all performance goals are achieved. 
Under the terms of the Performance Plan, the holder of a Target Award also 
will be deemed automatically to have earned and been granted the same 
Performance Award if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person (as 
defined in the Performance Plan) or certain changes in the composition of 
the Board of Directors occurs while the Target Award is outstanding. The 
same effect upon then-outstanding Target Awards also will result if, while 
there is an Acquiring Person, any of certain other significant 
transactions involving the Company should occur, unless the transaction 
has been approved by a majority of Directors who were Board members before 
the Acquiring Person became such. 

(5) The performance period (Performance Cycle) until maturation or payout 
is three fiscal years ending April 28, 1996. 

(6) The performance period is three fiscal years ending April 27, 1997. 

                            CERTAIN AGREEMENTS 

      The Company recognizes that establishing and maintaining a strong 
management team are essential to protecting and enhancing the interests of 
the Company and its shareholders. In order to assure management stability 
and the continuity of key management personnel, the Company entered into 
change in control agreements with certain key employees including, among 
others, all current executive officers. The employees eligible for change 
in control agreements are those selected by the Compensation Committee. 
These agreements, which were unanimously approved by the Board of 
Directors, provide that if any of such persons is terminated, other than 
for cause, disability, death or retirement, within three years after a 
change in control of the Company, that person shall be entitled to receive 
a lump sum severance payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his 
annualized salary and (ii) an amount equal to the average bonus paid to 
the employee in the previous three years, as well as certain other 
payments and benefits, including continuation of employee welfare benefit 
payments, and reimbursement of certain legal fees and expenses incurred by 
such employee in connection with enforcing such agreement following a 
change in control. In consideration of the foregoing, each of such persons 
agrees to remain in the employ of the Company during the pendency of any 
proposal for a change in control of the Company. The agreements expire 
December 31, 1994 and are automatically renewed for additional one-year 
periods unless either party gives 90 days' notice that it does not wish to 
extend the agreement. In the event of a change in control, the agreements 
are automatically extended for 36 months. 

      All of these agreements originally were entered into prior to 1993, 
but it is possible none of them would be eligible for "grandfathering" for 
purposes of $1,000,000 compensation deductibility limit imposed last 
August by enactment of sect.162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (further 
discussed under "Report of the Compensation Committee on Executive 
Compensation"), due to the renewal feature of the agreements. Therefore, 
if a payment obligation under an agreement is triggered by termination 
after a change in control, it also is possible that a substantial portion 
of the amount payable will not be deductible by the Company.

primarily in the residential segment of the furniture industry and two 
other larger public companies which operate in that business segment as 
well as in other business segments. The returns of each company have been 
weighted according to their respective stock market capitalization for 
purposes of arriving at a peer group average: RESIDENTIAL -- Bassett 
Furniture, Bush Industries, DMI Furniture, Flexsteel Industries, LADD 
Furniture, Pulaski Furniture, and Rowe Furniture; OTHERS -- MASCO

      REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

      The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other four 
highest paid executive officers, as well as the corporation's other senior 
executives at La-Z-Boy and all subsidiaries, is determined by the 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Committee is a 
standing committee of the Board of Directors which is comprised entirely 
of non-employee directors. The Committee has access to an independent 
compensation consultant to enable it to carry out its responsibilities. 
The Compensation Committee met three times in fiscal 1994. No member of 
the Committee is eligible to participate in any of the employee 
compensation plans or programs it administers. The Committee presents the 
following report on compensation for the Company's executive officers for 
fiscal 1994. Actual awards for fiscal year 1994 for the named executives 
are shown in the Summary Compensation Table preceding this report.

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY 

      The Company's executive compensation programs are premised on the 
belief that the interests of executives should be closely aligned with 
those of the Company's stockholders. Based on this philosophy, the 
Committee believes that a substantial portion of the aggregate potential 
compensation of executive officers should be directly and materially 
linked to the Company's operating performance. Consequently, a significant 
portion of each executive's total compensation is placed at risk and 
linked to the accomplishment of specific results which will benefit the 
Company's stockholders in both the short and long-term. Since the 
achievement of performance objectives over time is a primary determinant 
of share price, executive compensation is weighted heavily on the basis of 
performance and achievement of these goals. Under this performance 
orientation: 

 * Executives are motivated to improve the overall performance and profitability
   of the Company by rewarding them when specific, measurable results have been
   achieved. 

 * Accountability is further encouraged by incentive awards on the basis of
   executives' performance and contribution against defined long-term goals. 

 * In years when corporate performance has been superior, executives will 
   be well compensated, which will permit the Company to attract and retain the 
   talent needed to lead and grow its business; conversely, in years of below 
   average performance, compensation declines below competitive benchmarks. 

 * The compensation strategy will support business goals and direction and 
   specifically link executive and shareholder interests through 
   equity-based plans linked to the Company's common stock. 

 * The Company's compensation policy will maximize growth-driven financial 
   performance, balancing appropriately the short and long-term goals of 
   the Company. 

COMPENSATION PLAN GENERALLY 

      In carrying out its duties, the Committee regularly reviews the 
executive compensation programs of the Peer Group identified under 
"Performance Comparison" and of various manufacturing companies of similar 
size whose executives have similar responsibilities and operations. In 
fiscal 1994, this review included an analysis by an independent 
compensation consultant retained by the Company to permit the Committee to 
assure itself that the Company's total compensation program is properly 
integrated with both the Company's annual and longer term objectives and 
is competitive with compensation programs of other companies with which 
the Company must directly compete for executive talent. The chief 
components of the Company's executive compensation program consist of 
three elements: (1) base salary, (2) annual short-term incentive award, 
and (3) long-term incentives utilizing stock-based awards. 

BASE SALARY 

      The base salary of the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other 
senior executives is initially determined by evaluating the                 
responsibilities of the position against the competitive marketplace. By 
utilizing an independent compensation consulting firm and various salary 
surveys, each position is assigned a salary range which consists of 
minimum, mid-point and maximum salaries. Generally, base salary for senior 

                                     - 15 -

executives is targeted at the mid-point of salary ranges for comparable 
positions. In fiscal 1994, all base salaries, including that of Mr. 
Knabusch, were approximately 90% of the mid-point salaries. 

      An annual salary adjustment within each applicable salary range is 
determined by evaluating the performance of the individual, in the context 
of the financial results of the Company. Mr. Knabusch's salary for the 
1994 fiscal year, set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below, 
reflects the Committee's consideration of these factors. 

SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD 

      Annually, the Compensation Committee establishes short-term 
performance criteria for the management incentive plan. Performance 
criteria include such areas as growth in revenue and improved earnings. 
The specific focus and weighting of the criteria is based on the 
Committee's assessment of the key short-term priorities of the 
corporation. The performance criteria are established at the start of the 
fiscal year or as shortly thereafter as possible. The target and maximum 
award opportunity for each executive is based on competitive data provided 
by the independent compensation consultant. The award paid is based on 
actual results compared to the established performance targets. For fiscal 
1994, the performance criteria were improvement in sales revenue and net 
earnings. One-third of the award was based on sales revenue and two-thirds 
was based on earnings. This weighting is the result of the Board's 
continuing emphasis on improving earnings. For fiscal 1994, the Company's 
consolidated sales revenue increased 18% over fiscal 1993, and the 
Company's net earnings for fiscal 1994 increased 27% over fiscal 1993. 
Based on the sliding scale of performance goals established prior to the 
start of the fiscal year, the Company's financial performance resulted in 
the bonus payments as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. The 
annual incentive awards paid to the CEO and the other executives named in 
the table were based exclusively on the overall corporate performance 
using the system described above. 

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 

      The Company and the Compensation Committee have long recognized the 
importance of linking executive compensation and value created for 
shareholders. Consequently, stock-based awards are an important component 
of executive compensation and one which particularly links executive 
compensation to the maximization of shareholder values. For fiscal 1994, 
stock-based awards were potentially available to executive officers and 
management personnel under the Performance Plan approved by the 
shareholders last year, as well as under the Company's previously 
established and approved employee stock option and restricted stock plans. 
However, in light of the new availability of awards under the Performance 
Plan, the Committee determined for fiscal 1994 not to make any grants of 
restricted stock to any executive officers or other employees eligible to 
receive Target Awards under the Performance Plan. The Committee's present 
intention is to follow that same practice for the current year and future 
fiscal years. Awards under the programs are based both on a combination of 
an individual's contribution to the Company's performance and on the 
executive's individual performance. The Committee relies heavily on 
competitive data and the recommendations of an independent compensation 
consultant who utilizes comparative practices followed by a number of 
Fortune 500 companies. 
                                    - 16 -

      In determining the number of incentive stock option shares to be 
awarded to the CEO and other senior executives in fiscal 1994, the 
committee considered grants made by comparable companies and the 
cumulative grants to the CEO in the past. Based upon that review, the CEO 
was granted options to acquire 22,500 shares at an exercise price equal to 
110% of the market value on the date of grant, all as reported in the 
Summary Compensation Table preceding this report. No restricted stock 
awards have ever been made to the CEO in the past and none were granted to 
the CEO or the four senior officers in fiscal 1994. 

      To continue the alignment of stock compensation with shareholder 
interests the Committee has granted Performance-Based Shares in 1994. This 
plan focuses on the achievement of predetermined target levels of 
performance of both financial and non-financial objectives which are 
consistent with the Committee's strategic business goals for the award 
period. 

      In the opinion of the Committee, the Company's performance-based 
cash compensation system, together with the various equity-based plans, 
provides all of the management employees, including its executive officers 
and CEO, with an incentive to advance objective targets designed to 
increase shareholder value. 

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 

      The salary, short-term incentive bonus, and long-term incentive 
awards of the CEO are determined by the Committee substantially in 
accordance with the policies described above for all other executives of 
the Company. The Committee evaluates the CEO's contribution to the 
Company's achievement of both its short-term and long-term financial and 
non-financial objectives on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Committee 
evaluates performance of the CEO at least annually based upon a variety of 
factors, including the extent to which strategic and business plan goals, 
including such factors as earnings per share, return on equity, growth in 
sales and similar ratios are achieved. 

      In summary, based on the strong performance of the Company versus 
peer companies, and the Committee's determination of the CEO's 
contribution to this performance and to the positioning of the Company for 
future long-term growth, the Committee has determined that the 
compensation paid to the CEO, as described in the Summary Compensation 
Table preceding this report, is in the best interests of the Company and 
its shareholders.

RECENT TAX LAW DEVELOPMENTS 

      In August 1993, the Internal Revenue Code was amended to add a new 
sect.162(m), which, in general, limits the deductibility of certain 
compensation in excess of $1,000,000 per year paid on or after January 1, 
1994 by a publicly-held corporation to individuals named in the 
corporation's Summary Compensation Table for the year. Proposed 
regulations concerning sect.162(m) were issued by the Internal Revenue 
Service last December. Final regulations have not yet been issued. 

      Some types of compensation are excluded from sect.162(m)'s 
million-dollar deductibility limit, including certain compensation payable 
under "grandfathered" agreements entered into before enactment of 
sect.162(m) and certain "performance-based" compensation. Compensation 
associated with stock options or their exercise can qualify for a 
performance-based exclusion, as can other forms of compensation based on 
objective performance criteria, provided certain requirements are 
satisfied. 

      While there is necessarily some uncertainty in this area in light of 
the absence of final regulations, the Committee believes sect.162(m) does 
not affect deductibility by the Company of any fiscal 1994 compensation 
and does not expect it to affect deductibility of compensation paid or 
payable for the current year. The Committee also believes that the 
deductibility of any compensation that might arise in connection with 
exercises of currently outstanding employee stock options will not be 
affected by sect.162(m) and expects in due course to take or propose such 
additional actions as may be necessary or appropriate to preserve such 
deductibility with respect to options granted in the future. 

      However, as noted under "Certain Agreements," compensation payable 
in the future under the change of control agreements there discussed may 
not be fully deductible under sect.162(m). In addition, despite the use of 
objective performance criteria in the Performance Plan, at least some of 
the compensation associated with Performance Awards earned in the future 
with respect to Target Awards previously or hereafter granted may be 
non-deductible. 

      The maximum utilization of legally available tax deductions is 
beneficial to the Company and its shareholders, and this factor, like 
other relevant factors, is taken into account by the Compensation 
Committee as it reviews existing compensation programs and considers 
whether changes should be implemented or new programs developed. However, 
there are circumstances in which, on balance, the interests of 
shareholders are best served by the implementation of policies that may 
not maximize the tax deductible expenses of the Company. This is at least 
as true in the area of executive compensation as it is in other areas. 
While the Committee has considered and expects to continue to consider the 
impact of sect.162(m) in the course of its deliberations, decisions and 
recommendations will continue to be made with the goal of maximizing the 
creation of long-term shareholder value within the framework of the 
general compensation philosophy described above, rather than by rigid 
adherence to compensation deductibility standards.
