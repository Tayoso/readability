                                     PART I
 ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

 GENERAL

         Established in 1911, Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., (the "Company") is a leading
 broadline distributor of high quality food and related non-food products for
 the foodservice industry throughout the United States. The Company distributes
 its product line of more than 45,000 items to restaurants, industrial
 cafeterias, healthcare facilities, hotels, schools and colleges, supermarket
 delicatessens, membership warehouse stores and other establishments where food
 is prepared or consumed away from home.  It also offers design and engineering
 services for all types of foodservice operations through its contract/design
 group.  The Company's products consist of a broad line of private label and
 national branded food and foodservice equipment and supplies. The Company's
 proprietary private label products accounted for approximately 53% of the
 Company's net sales in fiscal 1994.  The Company develops and manufactures
 many of its private label products, and it also manufactures other products
 for certain customers under their own brand labels.  In fiscal 1994, the
 Company's sales of its self-manufactured products, including products sold
 through the Rykoff-Sexton Distribution Division (the "Distribution Division"),
 accounted for approximately 18% of net sales.

         The Company's principal operations are conducted through the
 Distribution Division, the Rykoff-Sexton Manufacturing Division (the
 "Manufacturing Division"), Tone Brothers, Inc. ("Tone Brothers") and San
 Francisco International Cheese Imports ("San Francisco International Cheese
 Imports")

         Distribution Division

         The Distribution Division is comprised of 26 distribution branches and
 eight additional sales offices that are largely located in major metropolitan
 areas throughout the United States.  The Distribution Division also offers
 design and engineering services for all types of foodservice operations
 through its ten contract/design offices.  In fiscal 1994, sales of the
 Distribution Division (including products sold through this division by the
 Manufacturing Division, Tone Brothers and San Francisco International Cheese
 Imports) generated approximately 94% of the Company's net sales.

         Manufacturing Division

         At its four plants, the Manufacturing Division manufactures products
 primarily under the Company's proprietary private labels and also manufactures
 products for other manufacturers, distributors, restaurant chains and other
 large users under their own brand labels.  Approximately 91% of the
 Manufacturing Division's products are sold through the Distribution Division,
 and the remainder are sold directly to customers.

         Tone Brothers

         Tone Brothers, a wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures spices,
 seasonings and salad dressing mixes and sells most of its products directly to
 customers such as membership warehouses, food manufacturers, foodservice
 distributors and specialty retail stores.

         San Francisco International Cheese Imports

         The Company also has a smaller division, San Francisco International
 Cheese Imports, which distributes domestic and imported cheeses and specialty
 and gourmet products both through the Distribution Division and directly to
 customers.


 PRODUCTS

         The Company offers to the foodservice industry a single source of
 supply for more than 45,000 private label and national branded items that are
 distributed to approximately 100,000 foodservice establishments.  The
 principal product lines are:

         No customer of the Company accounted for as much as two percent of the
 Company's sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1994.  No product
 distributed by the Company accounts for a material part of the Company's sales
 volume.  The Company does not experience material seasonal variations in its
 sales volume.

         The Company believes that product quality, close contact with
 customers, prompt and accurate delivery of orders, and the ability to provide
 related services are of primary importance in the distribution of products to
 the foodservice industry.  Sales offices are maintained at each of the
 Company's 26 distribution branches and eight additional locations as listed in
 the table below.  The Company's sales force of approximately 1,500 employees
 includes approximately 1,200 foodservice specialists from the Distribution
 Division who are organized by region and who are each assigned to a
 distribution branch. The sales force also includes account executives who
 handle multiunit accounts such as restaurant chains and other large users.  In
 addition to soliciting orders, sales personnel are trained to advise customers
 on menu selection, methods of preparing and serving food, merchandising
 techniques, unit cost controls and other operating procedures.

         Products are distributed to customers nationwide through the Company's
 26 distribution branches listed in the table below, as well as through
 independent distributors.  With the exception of an equipment and supply
 branch, each branch stocks a broad line of between 3,400 and 21,000 items for
 sale in its marketing area.  Customer orders are usually processed and shipped
 within 24 hours of receipt and are delivered directly to the customer.  The
 Company uses its warehouse facilities in Los Angeles, Indianapolis and Dorsey,
 Maryland to store and consolidate product orders from vendors for subsequent
 shipment to the distribution branches.

        International sales presently account for less than two percent of the
Company's total sales.  However, the Company believes that the potential for
growth in sales to foreign markets is significant, and it explores selected
opportunities to further develop this segment of its business.  The Company
currently exports products to Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Europe, Japan and
Australia.  In fiscal 1992, Tone Brothers formed a joint venture with an Indian
company for the preparation and exportation of black pepper and other spices
from India.  The Company also formed a joint venture in fiscal 1992 with a
Mexican trading and manufacturing firm to establish a distribution company in
Monterey, Mexico that services northeastern Mexico.

 SOURCES OF SUPPLY
 
           The Company purchases from approximately 7,900 suppliers.  No 
 supplier represented more than two percent of the Company's purchases in 
 fiscal 1994. These suppliers, which include both large multi-line and smaller 
 specialty processors and packagers, are selected primarily on the basis of 
 their ability to meet the Company's quality standards.  The Company has no 
 significant long-term purchasing obligations and believes that it has 
 adequate alternative sources of supply for almost all of the purchased items 
 and raw materials used in its manufacturing operations.

 QUALITY CONTROL AND REGULATION

         The Company maintains quality control laboratories in its Los Angeles,
 Indianapolis, Englewood and Des Moines facilities.  These laboratories are
 staffed by chemists and food technologists who are trained to control product
 quality for both self-manufactured and purchased private label products and to
 provide research and development support for the Company's manufactured
 products.  Quality control procedures include the sampling and testing of raw
 materials, purchased private label products and Company manufactured items for
 quality, taste and appearance and the microbiological testing of Company
 manufactured food items.

 EMPLOYEES

         As of April 30, 1994, the Company employed a total of approximately
 5,330 people, of whom approximately 2,170 were covered by collective
 bargaining agreements.  These agreements expire at various times over the next
 several years.  The Company believes its labor relations are good.

 COMPETITION

         The Company operates on a nationwide basis and encounters significant
 competition from a number of sources in each of its marketing areas.  The
 Company competes with two other large national distribution companies, Sysco
 Corporation and Kraft Foodservice Group (owned by Philip Morris Companies),
 both of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than
 the Company.  The Company also competes with numerous regional and local
 distributors that offer broad lines of products.  In recent years, the
 foodservice distribution industry has been characterized by significant
 consolidation and the emergence of larger competitors, principally through
 acquisitions.  There can be no assurances that the Company will not encounter
 increased competition in the future, which could adversely affect the
 Company's business.

         The Company believes that although price is a consideration,
 competition in the foodservice industry is generally on the basis of product
 quality, customer relations and service.  As one of the leading national
 broadline distributors to the foodservice industry, the Company believes that
 it carries a wider selection of food products of superior quality and value
 and a greater variety of package sizes than most of its competitors.  The
 Company attributes its ability to compete effectively in its markets to this
 wider food product selection and its broad line of related non-food products,
 which are offered through a dedicated, highly skilled and customer-oriented
 sales force. Further, the Company differentiates itself in part from its
 competitors by (i) providing many specialty products that have been developed
 specifically for the foodservice industry or for particular foodservice
 customers, (ii) maintaining an extensive selection of imported and specialty
 products, equipment and supplies and (iii) offering its design and engineering
 services for all types of foodservice operations.

 ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

         The Company's corporate headquarters are located on its owned property
 in Los Angeles, California. The Los Angeles distribution branch, which
 services the Southern California and Nevada markets, the Manufacturing
 Division headquarters, a large manufacturing plant and a warehouse that is
 used to store and consolidate product orders from

                  vendors are also located on these premises.  The property
                  consists of four buildings with approximately 1.4 million
                  square feet of space on 20.2 acres.  The Company plans to
                  relocate the Los Angeles distribution branch to a new
                  facility of approximately 420,000 square feet in La Mirada,
                  California.  The move is expected to take place toward the
                  end of fiscal 1995.

                          The executive offices of the Distribution Division
                  are located in Lisle, Illinois and occupy approximately
                  54,500 square feet pursuant to a lease which expires in
                  November 2001.

                          Tone Brothers leases a facility of approximately
                  195,000 square feet in Des Moines, Iowa for its office,
                  warehouse and manufacturing operations.  The lease on this
                  property expires in April 2000.  In January, 1994, the
                  Company completed the construction of an additional 335,000
                  square foot modern manufacturing facility in Des Moines.

                          In addition to the manufacturing plant located on the
                  Los Angeles property, the Company owns and operates
                  manufacturing plants totaling 234,000 square feet in
                  Indianapolis, Indiana and Englewood, New Jersey.  The Company
                  also leases approximately 32,000 square feet in Brooklyn, New
                  York for office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities.  The
                  lease on this property expires in August 1995.

                          Equipment and machinery owned by the Company and used
                  in its operations consist principally of electronic data
                  processing equipment, food and non-food processing and
                  packaging equipment and chemical compounding, blending and
                  product handling equipment. The Company owns a fleet of
                  approximately 1,200 vehicles consisting of tractors,
                  trailers, vans and bobtails, which are used for long hauls
                  and local deliveries.  In addition, the Company leases
                  approximately 330 delivery vehicles under terms which expire
                  at various dates through 2000.

                          During fiscal 1994, the Company nearly doubled the
                  space and added a new freezer and cooler to its Orlando
                  distribution branch and relocated its San Francisco
                  International Cheese Imports operation to a new, larger
                  facility. At present, the Company is completing an expansion
                  of its Greensboro, North Carolina branch, is doubling the
                  capacity of its Detroit branch and is in the process of
                  planning to upgrade facilities at several other locations as
                  well.
                          The Company considers that its office, warehouse and
                  manufacturing facilities are adequate to support present and
                  immediately forseeable future operations.  However, the
                  Company continues to locate and occupy new facilities because
                  of its expanding business.

                  ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

                          The Company is not a party to any material legal
                  proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation
                  incidental to the business of the Company.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
    Rykoff-Sexton, Inc.

         We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
 standards, the consolidated financial statements included in Rykoff-Sexton,
 Inc.'s Form 10-K and have issued our report thereon dated June 10, 1994.  Our
 audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements
 taken as a whole.  The schedules listed in Item 14. (a)(2) are the
 responsibility of the Company's management and are presented for purposes of
 complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
 of the basic consolidated financial statements.  These schedules have been
 subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
 consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all
 material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
 relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

was in place.

       (C)  The Company started its short-term commercial paper program in
April 1992.  Thus, the average balance outstanding and weighted average
interest rate for the fiscal year were not meaningful.

         WHEREAS, on the Initial Delivery Date, the Lessee or the Sublessee
will transfer to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, and the Agent, on
behalf of the Lessors will purchase, the items of Eligible Equipment identified
in Schedule II hereto;

         AND WHEREAS, on each Subsequent Delivery Date, Lessee or Sublessee, as
the case may be, will cause to be transferred to the Agent, for the benefit of
the Lessors, certain of the items of Eligible Equipment generally described on
Schedule III hereto and the Agent, on behalf of the Lessors, will purchase such
Equipment directly from the Manufacturers or Lessee, as the case may be;

         AND WHEREAS, the Eligible Equipment is grouped into Functional Units
as identified on Schedule Y hereto;

         AND WHEREAS, upon the transfer of the Functional Units on each
Delivery Date, Lessors will lease such Functional Units to Lessee and Lessee
will lease such Functional Units from the Lessors pursuant to the terms of the
Lease substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and a Lease Supplement
substantially in the form of Exhibit B to the Lease;

         AND WHEREAS, the Lessee will enter into the Sublease substantially in
the form of Exhibit B hereto subleasing to the Sublessee the Functional Units
described therein;

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms and conditions
herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                 (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set
         forth, and in reliance on the representations and warranties contained
         herein or made pursuant hereto, following receipt of the Initial
         Delivery Date Notice and each Subsequent Delivery Date Notice, each

         aggregate Purchase Price of the Eligible Equipment specified in the
         Delivery Date Notice to be delivered by Lessee prior to such Delivery
         Date, multiplied by such Lessor's Commitment Percentage (each such
         transfer being referred to herein as a "Funding").  In no event shall
         any Lessor be required to provide funds under this Participation
         Agreement in an aggregate amount exceeding such Lessor's Commitment.

                 (b)      Remittances pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be

                 (c)  If on any date specified for a Funding, any Lessor
         wrongfully fails to make any payment then required of it, then any
         party hereto (other than the party so failing to make the payment or
         otherwise in breach) may cancel its obligations under this
         Participation Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by
         notice to the other parties; provided, however, that if such failure to
         pay is on the part of only one Lessor, then the other Lessors shall be
         obligated to make the payments that they would otherwise have been
         obligated to make pursuant to the relevant

         Delivery Date consists solely of Functional Units; and provided,
         further, that if the total Purchase Price of the Equipment subject to
         the Lease must be reduced because of a Lessor's wrongful failure to
         fund, the Required Lessors shall have the right to reject any tendered
         delivery of a Functional Unit so long as there are one or more other
         Functional Units described on Schedule III which have not previously
         been delivered and which have a total Purchase Price approximately
         equal to the rejected Functional Unit.  The party wrongfully failing
         to make its payment shall not be responsible for any consequential
         damages suffered by the Sublessee or the Lessee or any of their
         Affiliates as a result of its failure to so fund.

                 Delivery Date occurs prior to March 31, 1995;

                          (iii)  each Funding shall provide for financing of
                 Eligible Equipment having an aggregate Purchase Price which
                 equals or exceeds, except in the case of the final Funding,
                 $1,000,000;

                          (iv)  all items of Eligible Equipment to be purchased
                 with the proceeds of such Funding shall comprise one or more
                 complete Functional Units; and

                 Equipment at the end of the Initial Term and each Renewal
                 Term, which shall be set forth in such report, is a reasonable
                 estimate, and that it would be reasonable to assume an
                 increase for inflation of at least two percent (2%) per annum
                 in such Fair Market Values, and

                          (iii)  the remaining composite economic useful life

         warranties contained herein are true and correct in all material
         respects on such Delivery Date;

         such Equipment plus the Charges properly attributable thereto;

                 (i)      all proceedings taken in connection with the Delivery

                                  ARTICLE III

                     ADDITIONAL DELIVERY DATE REQUIREMENTS

         Section 3.1  Lease Supplements.  On each Delivery Date, Lessee shall
execute and deliver to each of the Lessors and the Agent a Lease Supplement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessors and substantially in the
form set forth in Exhibit B to the Lease (a "Lease Supplement").  Each Lease
Supplement to be executed and delivered by Lessee on each Delivery Date shall
set forth:

                 (a)      in Schedule I thereto, a description of and the
         Purchase Price for each Functional Unit to be purchased by Lessor on
         such Delivery Date;

                 (b)      in Schedule II thereto, the Interest Rate, the Interim
         Rent, the Applicable Percentage Amount, a schedule of the installments
         of Basic Rent and Renewal Rent and the Payment Dates therefor and the
         Supplement Balance of such Lease Supplement as of the end of the
         Initial Term and each Renewal Term;





                                      10
<PAGE>   15
                 (c)      in Schedule III thereto, a schedule of each Lessor's
         proportionate share of each installment of Rent and of the Supplement
         Balance as of the end of the Initial Term and each Renewal Term, based
         on each such Lessor's Lease Percentage; and

                 (d)      in Schedule IV thereto, the Functional Unit Balance
         of each Functional Unit subject to that Lease Supplement as of the
         Delivery Date therefor and as of each Payment Date in the Initial Term
         and each Renewal Term.

Schedules I, II, III and IV to each Lease Supplement shall be prepared by Agent
and delivered on or prior to the relevant Delivery Date.  With respect to the
Lease Supplement delivered on the Initial Delivery Date, all parties hereto
hereby approve such Schedules, and with respect to all Lease Supplements
delivered on subsequent Delivery Dates, the items set forth by Agent in such
Schedules shall be conclusive and binding upon Lessee for all purposes
hereunder.  The schedule of Rent set forth in Schedule II to each Lease
Supplement shall be calculated based upon the following assumptions:

                 (i) that Lessors have loaned the total Purchase Price of the
         Eligible Equipment to be covered by the Lease Supplement to the Lessee
         on the applicable Delivery Date Closing;

                 (ii) that such principal amount of such deemed loan will bear
         interest at the Interest Rate;

                 (iii) that the maturity date of such deemed loan will be April
         30, 2000;

                 (iv) that the average life of such deemed loan will be four
         years plus or minus six months;

                 (v) that the "Specified Portion" of the principal amount of
         such deemed loan on each anniversary of the Base Commencement Date of
         such Lease Supplement shall be 21-1/2% of the outstanding principal
         balance of the deemed loan on the immediately preceding anniversary of
         such Base Commencement Date;

                 (vi) that a payment consisting solely of interest accrued on
         the outstanding principal of the deemed loan at the Interest Rate will
         be due and payable on the last day of the 90-day period ending on
         April 30, July 30, October 30 or January 30 (as the case may be) in
         which the deemed loan was made, and that thereafter principal and
         interest will be paid on each Payment Date; and





                                      11
<PAGE>   16
                 (vii) that the Supplement Balance of the relevant Lease
         Supplement at the end of the second Renewal Term and each Renewal Term
         thereafter will be equal to the Adjusted Appraised Value of the
         Functional Units subject to such Lease Supplement.

Upon execution and delivery of each Lease Supplement, Lessee conclusively
agrees to lease from Lessors on the terms and conditions set forth in the Lease
and such Lease Supplement the Functional Units described in Schedule I to such
Lease Supplement.

         Section 3.2  Delivery of Search Reports.  No later than April 30,
1995, Lessee shall cause to be delivered to the Agent and each Lessor (i)
reports as to each of the Lessee and Sublessee by the office of the Secretary
of State of each State in which any of the Equipment is located, each dated as
close to April 30, 1995 as practicable, in respect of a search of the Uniform
Commercial Code files maintained by such offices; and (ii) acceptable reports
as to each of the Lessee and Sublessee by the offices of the appropriate filing
or recording office of each County or Parish in which any of the Equipment is
located, each dated as close to April 30, 1995 as practicable in respect of a
search of the Uniform Commercial Code files and any indices of Liens maintained
by such offices (including, if applicable, indices of judgment, revenue and tax
liens), to determine in each case whether there are any Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) filed against the Equipment.

         Section 3.3  Postponement of a Subsequent Delivery Date.  A Subsequent
Delivery Date with respect to all or any Functional Units identified in a
Delivery Date Notice may be postponed by the Lessee from time to time (but
subject in any event to Section 2.2(a)) if the Lessee gives the Agent and each
Lessor written notice of such postponement no later than two days prior to such
date.  The notice shall indicate that the delivery of all of the Functional
Units identified in the applicable Delivery Date Notice, or if only a portion
is being delayed, the notice shall identify the Functional Unit(s) that will
not be delivered on such date.  The notice shall also indicate the Subsequent
Delivery Date on which such items will be purchased.  A postponement of a
Delivery Date shall not postpone the corresponding Funding, which shall be made
in any event, and to the extent proceeds are not used to purchase Eligible
Equipment, such proceeds shall be held by Agent in trust for the Lessors,
subject to the terms of Section 3.4.

         Section 3.4  Interest Payments to Lessors.  (a)  In the event of any
postponement of a Subsequent Delivery Date with respect to all or any
Functional Unit(s) pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, or if on a Subsequent
Delivery Date all or any Functional





                                      12
<PAGE>   17
Unit(s) is not delivered or accepted by the Lessee under the Lease for any
reason, the Lessee will reimburse each Lessor for the loss of the use of its
funds occasioned by such deposit, postponement or failure to deliver or accept
(unless such failure to accept is caused by a default by such Lessor) by paying
to each such Lessor on demand (A) interest at the Assumed Interest Rate on the
amount funded by such Lessor but which is not applied to the purchase of
Functional Units (the "Unfunded Amount") for the period from and including the
Subsequent Delivery Date specified in such notice to but excluding the earlier
of (x) the Business Day on which such Unfunded Amount is returned to it and (y)
the next Delivery Date when such Unfunded Amount is applied by the Agent to
purchase Functional Units pursuant to Article II minus (B) such interest as
shall have been realized from the investments by the Agent of the amount of the
Unfunded Amount (if investment thereof was effected pursuant to Section 3.4(b)
hereof).  If the requisite amount of Equipment is not accepted on a Subsequent
Delivery Date, the Agent shall retain the Unfunded Amount in trust for such
Lessor until March 31, 1995, on which day (or at such earlier time as may have
been directed in the same manner by the Lessee), such funds (together with
accrued interest thereon) shall be returned to such Lessor not later than 11:00
a.m., California time in the same form as such funds were made available by
such Lessor, unless the requisite amount of Equipment shall have been accepted
by the Lessee, and the conditions set forth in Section 2.6 hereof shall have
been satisfied or waived, prior to such return of funds, in which case such
funds shall be applied in the manner and at the times provided in Section 2.4
hereof.  Upon return of such funds pursuant to the preceding sentence, such
Lessor's Commitment shall be canceled and Lessee shall pay to each Lessor on
demand a Make-Whole Premium with respect to the Unfunded Amount.

         (b)     Upon any failure to deliver or accept the requisite amount of
Equipment on a Subsequent Delivery Date, the Agent shall, to the extent
practicable, invest all funds held by it, if any, under Section 3.4(a) hereof,
in Permitted Investments pursuant to written instructions by the Required
Lessors.  Agent shall bear no liability for any losses on such investments.
Agent shall distribute, quarterly in arrears (or promptly upon the return or
application of such Lessor's Commitment, if earlier), to each Lessor which had
previously delivered its Commitment to it any interest or other income realized
from the investment thereof, ratably, in the proportion that such Lessor's
Commitment bears to the total of such Commitments.

         (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4,
no Lessor shall be under any obligation to make its Commitment available after
March 31, 1995, and such time shall be of the essence in this Participation
Agreement.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         Section 4.1  Nature of Transaction.  It is the intent of the
Participants that:  (a) the transaction contemplated hereby constitutes an
operating lease from the Agent and Lessors to Lessee for purposes of Lessee's
financial reporting, (b) the transaction contemplated hereby grants (and with
respect to existing Equipment, preserves) ownership in the Equipment to the
Lessee for purposes of Federal and state income tax, bankruptcy and Uniform
Commercial Code purposes, and (c) the Lease grants a security interest in the
Equipment and the other Collateral to the Agent for the benefit of the Agent
and the Lessors.  Nevertheless, the Lessee and Sublessee acknowledge and agree
that no Participant or any other Person has made any representations or
warranties concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the
Operative Agreements and that the Lessee and Sublessee have obtained and relied
upon such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Agreements
as they deem appropriate.

         [Section 4.2  Reserved]

         Section 4.3  Replacement of Equipment.  Required Lessors shall
instruct the Agent to release a Substituted Item or a Replaced Unit from the
Lease and evidence such release by the execution and delivery of a termination
statement release, a Bill of Sale and such other documents as may be required
to release the Substituted Item or Replaced Unit from the Lease and which are
in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Lessors subject to the
following conditions:

                 (a)      each of the Lessors and Agent has received a written
         notice from the Lessee (the "Replacement Notice") at least 10 days
         prior to the requested release which identifies (i) the Replacement
         Part and Substituted Item or (ii) the Replacement Unit and the
         Replaced Unit, as the case may be;

                 (b)      in the case of a substitution pursuant to Section
         5.4(a) of the Lease, the Replacement Part is new and of the same or
         greater value, utility and useful life than the Substituted Item on
         the date it became subject to the Lease to the satisfaction of the
         Lessors;

                 (c)      Lessee shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for
         the benefit of the Lessors, a Bill of Sale and a certificate of
         acceptance conforming to Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Lease
         Supplement in respect of the Replacement Part or the Replacement Unit,
         as the case may be; and





                                      14
<PAGE>   19
                 (d)      the conditions set forth in Sections 2.6(b), 2.6(e),
         2.6(g), 2.6(h), 2.6(l) and 2.6(m) (and Section 2.6(c), if requested by
         the Required Lessors in connection with a substitution pursuant
         to Section 5.4(a) of the Lease) have been satisfied with respect to the
         Replacement Part or the Replacement Unit, as the case may be, as
         though it had been identified in a Delivery Date Notice.  Lessee shall
         purchase the Replacement Part or the Replacement Unit, as the case may
         be, with its own funds.  There shall be no obligation on the part of
         the Agent or the Lessors to pay for or otherwise finance any
         Replacement Part or Replacement Unit except by way of releasing the
         corresponding Substituted Item or Replaced Unit as provided by
         this Section 4.3.

         Section 4.4  Additional Fees.

                 (a)  On March 31, 1995, Lessee shall pay directly to the

or other governmental authority affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lessor directly (or by its parent
company) and such Lessor determines (in its sole and absolute discretion) that
the rate of return on it or its parent's capital as a consequence of the
Fundings made by such Lessor hereunder is reduced to a level below that which
such Lessor or its parent could have achieved but for the occurrence of any
such circumstances, then, in any such case, upon written notification from time
to time by such Lessor to Lessee, Lessee shall immediately pay as Supplemental
Rent hereunder directly to such Lessor additional amounts sufficient to
compensate Lessor or its parent on an after-tax basis for such reduction in
rate of return.  A statement of each Lessor as to

method of averaging or attribution that it (in its reasonable discretion) shall
deem applicable.

time to time accepts the assignments contained in this Section 4.6.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Agent shall not have any
obligation or liability under any Purchase Agreement by reason of, or arising
out of, the assignment contained in this Section 4.6 or be obligated to perform
any of the obligations or duties of the Lessee under any Purchase Agreement or
to make any payment or to take any other related action thereunder.

         amended (the "Securities Act"), and, assuming the truth and accuracy
         of the representations set forth in Section 5.2(g), the issuance, sale
         and delivery of such interests under the circumstances contemplated by

         the Securities Act or the qualification of any of the Operative
         Agreements under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

their representations, warranties or covenants.

         of remedies under the Operative Agreements, transfers pursuant to the
         exercise of the Sale Option or the Lessee Purchase Option or a
         transfer to Lessee or otherwise pursuant to the Lease);

                 (iv)     Impositions based upon the involuntary transfer by
         Agent or any Lessor of any interest in the Equipment in connection
         with any bankruptcy or other similar proceeding for the relief of
         debtors in which such Indemnitee is the debtor or any foreclosure by a
         creditor of such Indemnitee;

                 (v)      any interest, penalties or additions to tax imposed
         on an Indemnitee that would not have resulted but for the failure of
         such Indemnitee to file any return properly and timely unless such
         failure shall result from the failure of the Lessee to fulfill its
         obligations, if any, underSection 8.4 with respect to such return;

                 (vi)  with respect to an Indemnitee, Impositions that result
         from such Indemnitee engaging, with respect to the Equipment or any
         part thereof, in transactions other than those permitted by this
         Agreement or any other Operative Agreement;

                 (vii)  Impositions to the extent of the excess of such
         Impositions over the amount of such Impositions that would have been
         imposed (or, if less, that would not have been subject to
         indemnification hereunder) had there not been a transfer by a
         predecessor in interest of the Indemnitee (other than the Agent in its
         capacity as Agent) of any interest in the Equipment or any interest
         arising under any Operative Agreement or any Lessor other than a
         transfer in contemplation of the exercise of remedies while an Event
         of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

                 (viii)  subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 8.2,
         Impositions that are being contested in accordance with Section 8.2
         during the pendency of such contest;

                 (ix)     subject to the last paragraph of this Section 8.1,
         Impositions to the extent such Impositions would not have been imposed
         if such Indemnitee had not engaged in activities in the jurisdiction
         imposing such Imposition which activities are unrelated to the
         transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements;

                 (x)  any Impositions imposed on an Indemnitee to the extent
         the payment or accrual of such Impositions actually reduces
         permanently the Impositions of such Indemnitee otherwise payable by
         such Indemnitee;

                 (xi)  any Impositions that would not have been imposed but for
         the existence of any Lessor Liens created by such Indemnitee or any
         act or omission of the Indemnitee that are in violation of any of the
         terms of the Operative Agreements or that constitute gross negligence
         or willful misconduct or





                                      38
<PAGE>   43
         the inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant in any
         material respect by the Indemnitee, but only if, in any such case,
         such act, omission or inaccuracy is not a result of (a) any act or
         omission of the Lessee or the Sublessee or (b) the breach or
         inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Lessee
         or the Sublessee;  and

                 (xii)  except where there exists an Event of Default,
         Impositions in respect of any of the Equipment arising after the
         expiration or earlier termination of the Lease in respect of such
         Equipment and the return or other disposition of such Equipment in
         full compliance with the terms of the Lease, provided that such
         Impositions do not relate to acts or events arising or occurring prior
         to or coincident with such time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.1, Lessee agrees to
pay or reimburse Indemnitees for, and to indemnify and hold Indemnitees
harmless from, any Impositions imposed by any State or any political
subdivision thereof in which any Equipment is located (including income,
severance, franchise and personal property taxes, but net of any foreign,
Federal, state or local income tax benefits which are recognized by Indemnitees
as a result of such Imposition) arising solely by virtue of, and to the extent
attributable to, Indemnitees participation in the transactions contemplated by
the Operative Agreements or the exercise of remedies under the Operative
Agreements.

         Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xii) of
this Section 8.1, Lessee agrees to pay or reimburse Indemnitees for, and to
indemnify and hold Indemnitees harmless from: (A) any Imposition based on, or
measured by the net income of Indemnitees imposed by any federal, state or
local taxing authority in the United States or any taxing authority in any
other jurisdiction in which Indemnitee maintains its principal place of
business to the extent they would not have been imposed if on each Delivery
Date the Lessors had advanced funds directly to Lessee in the form of a loan
secured by the Equipment in an amount equal to the amount advanced on such
Delivery Date or Dates with the debt service for such loan equal to scheduled
rental payments payable from time to time and a principal balance in the amount
of the Lease Balance remaining at the end of the Initial Term and each Renewal
Term was due at the end of such terms (the "Income Tax Indemnity"); and (B)
Impositions imposed with respect to the payment, receipt or accrual of any
indemnity payment hereunder; and (C) with respect to any Lessor which is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States, or a state thereof, and which
has complied with




                                      39
<PAGE>   44
Section 8.6, any deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income
tax.

         Section 8.2  Contest.  Lessee shall pay on or before the time or times
prescribed by law any Impositions (except any Impositions excluded by Section
8.1); provided, however, that Lessee shall be under no obligation to pay any
such Imposition so long as the payment of such Imposition is not delinquent or
is being contested by a Permitted Contest.  If any claim or claims is or are
made against any Indemnitee solely for any Imposition which is subject to
indemnification as provided in Section 8.1, Indemnitee shall as soon as
practicable, but in no event more than 20 days after receipt of formal written
notice of the Imposition or proposed Imposition, notify Lessee and if, in the
opinion of Lessee and tax counsel acceptable to the Indemnitee, there exists a
reasonable basis to contest such Imposition (and if clause (ii) of the
definition of "Permitted Contest" continues to be satisfied and so long as no
Event of Default exists), Lessee at its expense may, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, contest such Imposition (other than an Imposition resulting in
an Income Tax Indemnity), and subsequently may appeal any adverse
determination, in the appropriate administrative and legal forums; provided
that in all other circumstances, upon notice from Lessee that there exists a
reasonable basis to contest any such Imposition, the Indemnitee, at Lessee's
expense, shall contest any such Imposition.  Lessee shall pay all expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in contesting any such Imposition (including,
without limitation, all reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees, including
the allocated costs of internal counsel), upon demand by the Indemnitee.
Lessee shall have the right to participate in the conduct of any proceedings
controlled by the Indemnitee to the extent that such participation by such
Person does not interfere with the Indemnitee's control of such contest and
Lessee shall in all events be kept informed of material developments relative
to such proceedings.  The Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the
conduct of any proceedings controlled by Lessee and the Indemnitee shall in all
events be kept informed of material developments relative to such proceedings.
The Indemnitees agree that a contested claim for which Lessee would be required
to make a reimbursement payment hereunder will not be settled or compromised
without Lessee's prior written consent, unless clause (ii) of the definition of
"Permitted Contest" would not continue to be satisfied.  Indemnitee shall
endeavor to settle or compromise any such contested claim in accordance with
written instructions received from Lessee, provided that: (x) Lessee on or
before the date the Indemnitee executes a settlement or compromise pays the
contested Imposition to the extent agreed upon or makes an indemnification
payment to the Indemnitee in an amount acceptable to the Indemnitee; and (y)
the settlement or compromise does not, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnitee materially adversely




                                      40
<PAGE>   45
affect the right of the Lessor to receive payment of Rent or the Lease Balance,
or involve a material risk of sale, forfeiture or loss of any of the Equipment
or any interest therein or materially adversely affect the security interests
created by the Lease.  The failure of an Indemnitee to timely contest a claim
against it for any Imposition which is subject to indemnification under Section
8.1 and for which it has an obligation to Lessee to contest under this Section
8.2 in the manner required by applicable law or regulations where Lessee has
timely requested that such Indemnitee contest such claim shall relieve Lessee
of its obligations to such Indemnitee under Section 8.1 with respect to such
claim to the extent such failure results in the loss of an effective contest.
If applicable law requires the payment of a contested Imposition as a condition
to, or regardless of, its being contested, and Lessee chooses to contest such
Imposition or to direct the Indemnitee to contest such Imposition in accordance
with this Section, then Lessee shall provide the Indemnitee with the funds to
pay such Imposition, such provision of funds to be deemed a non-interest
bearing loan by Lessee to the Indemnitee to be repaid by any recovery of such
Imposition from such contest and any remaining unpaid amount not recovered to
offset Lessee's obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for such Imposition.  In
the event that the Indemnitee receives a refund (or like adjustment) in respect
of any Imposition for which the Indemnitee has been reimbursed by Lessee, the
Indemnitee shall immediately remit the amount of such refund (or like
adjustment) to Lessee, net of all costs and expenses incurred by such
Indemnitee.

         Section 8.3  Gross Up.  If an Indemnitee shall not be entitled to a
corresponding and equal deduction with respect to any Imposition which Lessee
is required to pay or reimburse under Section 8.1 or 8.2 and which payment or
reimbursement constitutes income to such Indemnitee, then Lessee shall also pay
to such Indemnitee on demand the amount of such Imposition on a gross-up basis
such that, after subtracting all Impositions imposed on such Indemnitee with
respect to such payment by Lessee (including any Impositions otherwise excluded
by Section 8.1 and assuming for this purpose that such Indemnitee was subject
to taxation at the applicable Federal, state or local marginal rates used to
compute such Indemnitee's tax return for the year in which such income is
taxable) such Indemnitee shall be fully reimbursed for the Imposition with
respect to which such Indemnitee is entitled to be paid or reimbursed.

         Section 8.4  Tax Returns.  Except as otherwise provided in the third
sentence below, Lessee shall prepare and file (whether or not it is a legal
obligation of an Indemnitee) all tax returns or reports that may be required
with respect to any Impositions assessed, charged or imposed on the Equipment
or the Lease, including, but not limited to sales and use taxes (as to which
Lessee shall prepare all returns as hereinabove provided and file




                                      41
<PAGE>   46
all such returns to the extent permitted by applicable law), property taxes (ad
valorem and real property) and any other tax or charge based upon the
ownership, leasing, subleasing, rental, sale, purchase, possession, use,
operation, delivery, return or other disposition of any of the Equipment or
upon the rentals or the receipts therefrom (excluding, however, any tax based
upon the net income of an Indemnitee or any tax which is in substitution for or
relief of a tax imposed upon or measured by the net income of an Indemnitee).
Lessee may notify in writing all applicable governmental authorities having
jurisdiction with respect to personal property taxes that Lessee is the
appropriate party for receiving notices of (or copies of, if such governmental
authority is required by law to notify Agent) assessment, appeal and payment
with respect to the Equipment.  If an Indemnitee is obligated by law to file
any such reports or returns, then Lessee shall at least 10 days before the same
are due prepare the same and forward them to the Indemnitee, as appropriate,
with detailed instructions as to how to comply with all applicable filing
requirements, together with funds in the amount of any payment required
pursuant thereto.  Indemnitee shall forward to Lessee at its address listed on
the signature page hereto copies of all assessment and valuation notices it
receives within 10 days of receipt; provided that Indemnitee's failure to
deliver on a timely basis such notices shall not relieve Lessee of any
obligations hereunder.

         Section 8.5  Tax Character of Transaction.  It is the intention of the
Participants that for Federal and state income tax purposes: (a)  the Lessee or
a corporation that is a member of its affiliated group shall be treated as
owner of the Equipment with the ability to claim depreciation on the Equipment
and to deduct the interest component of the Rents; and (b) the Rents payable to
Agent under the Lease constitute payments of interest and principal.
Participants agree that neither they nor any corporation controlled by them, or
under common control with them, directly or indirectly will at any time take
any action or fail to take any action with respect to the filing of any income
tax return, including an amended income tax return, inconsistent with the
intention of the parties expressed in the preceding sentence.

         Section 8.6  Withholding Tax Exemption.  (a) At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the first date on which any Rent is payable hereunder or
under any other Operative Agreement for the account of any Lessor not
incorporated under the laws of the United States or a state thereof, such
Lessor agrees that it will have delivered to each of the Lessee and the Agent
two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224, certifying in either case that such Lessor is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements without
deduction or withholding of any




                                      42
<PAGE>   47
United States Federal income taxes.  Each Lessor which so delivers a Form 1001
or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Lessee and the Agent two
additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that
such form expires (currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and
one calendar year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of
any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and
such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Lessee or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lessor
is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the other Operative
Agreements without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income
taxes, unless an event (including any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Lessor from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Lessor advises the Lessee and the Agent that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any withholding of United States Federal income tax.

         (b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which
any Rent is payable hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement for the
account of any Lessor who does not have a street address in the State of
California , such Lessor agrees that it will have delivered to each of the
Lessee and the Agent two duly completed copies of California Form 587 or 590,
certifying in either case that such Lessor is entitled to receive payments
under this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements without deduction or
withholding of any California income taxes.  Each Lessor which so delivers a
Form 587 or 590 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Lessee and the
Agent two additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the
date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it
(including, without limitation, any change in residency or address), and such
amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Lessee or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lessor
is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the other Operative
Agreements without deduction or withholding of any California income taxes,
unless an event (including any change in law or regulation) has occurred prior
to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which
renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lessor from
duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lessor
advises the Lessee and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments
without any withholding of California income tax.

understood and agreed by and among the parties hereto that, except as otherwise
provided herein or in the other Operative Agreements:  (a) this Participation
Agreement and the other Operative Agreements to which the Agent is a party are

under the Lease in the exercise of the power and authority conferred and vested
in it as such Agent; (b) each and all of the undertakings and agreements herein
made on the part of the Agent are each and every one of them made and intended
not as personal undertakings and agreements by the Agent, or for the purpose or
with the intention of binding the Agent personally, but are made and intended
for the purpose of binding only the Collateral unless expressly provided
otherwise; (c) actions to be taken by the Agent pursuant to its obligations
under the Operative Agreements may, in certain circumstances, be taken by the

subscriber to the capital stock of, or stockholder, officer or director of, the
Agent to perform any covenants either express or implied contained herein, all
such liability, if any, being expressly waived by the other parties hereto and
by any Person claiming by, through or under them; and (e) so far as the Agent,

Person claiming by, through or under them shall look solely to the Collateral
and the Lessee (and the Sublessee, if appropriate) for the performance of any
obligation under any of the instruments referred to herein; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 9.1 shall be construed to limit in scope or
substance the general corporate liability of the Agent in respect of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct or those representations, warranties and
covenants of the Agent in its individual capacity set forth herein or in any of
the other agreements contemplated hereby.

                           LEASE INTENDED AS SECURITY


         This LEASE INTENDED AS SECURITY (as amended, modified, restated or
supplemented from time to time, this Lease") dated as of April 29, 1994 (the
"Effective Date") is between Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Lessee"), with its principal office at 761 Terminal Street, Los Angeles, CA
90021, BA Leasing & Capital Corporation, Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation and
Manufacturers Bank (collectively, the "Lessors" and each a "Lessor"), and BA
Leasing & Capital Corporation, a California corporation, not in its individual
capacity, but solely in its capacity as agent under this Lease ("Agent") for
the benefit of the Lessors.

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in
that certain Participation Agreement dated as of April 29, 1994 (the
"Participation Agreement"), among Lessee, Sublessee, the Lessors and Agent,
Lessors have agreed to purchase and thereafter lease the Equipment to Lessee
pursuant to this Lease.

         AND WHEREAS, the Participation Agreement contemplates that, following
Lessee's execution and delivery of this Lease, Lessee will sublease a portion
of the Equipment to Sublessee pursuant to the terms of the Sublease;

         AND WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
(including those used in the foregoing recitals) shall have the meanings
specified in Schedule X to the Participation Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires.

         AND WHEREAS, to secure Lessee's obligations under this Lease and the
other Operative Agreements, Lessee will grant to the Agent, for the benefit of
the Lessors, a security interest in the Collateral, including, without
limitation, the Equipment and the Sublease.

         NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                   Article I

                            DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

         Section 1.1.     Acceptance and Lease of Equipment.  Subject to each
Participant's satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of the conditions set
forth in Articles II and III of the Participation Agreement, on each Delivery
Date and upon execution





<PAGE>   92
and delivery of a Lease Supplement covering all of the Equipment to be
purchased on such date, Lessors shall lease to the Lessee, and Lessee will
lease from the Lessors, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Lease and such Lease Supplement, the Equipment purchased by the Agent on behalf
of the Lessors on such Delivery Date.

         Section 1.2.     Acceptance Procedure.  Lessors hereby authorize one
or more employees of Lessee to be designated by Lessee as the authorized
representative or representatives of Lessors to accept delivery of the
Equipment on each Delivery Date.  Lessee hereby agrees that such acceptance of
delivery by such authorized representative or representatives and the execution
and delivery by Lessee on each Delivery Date of a Lease Supplement shall,
without further act, constitute the irrevocable acceptance by Lessee of the
Equipment which is the subject thereof for all purposes of this Lease and the
other Operative Agreements on the terms set forth therein and herein.


                                   Article II

                                   LEASE TERM

         Section 2.1.     Initial Term.  The commencement of the term of this
Lease shall be on the Effective Date and shall continue until, but not
including, April 29, 1995 (the "Initial Term"), unless earlier terminated in
accordance with the provisions herein or extended pursuant to Section 2.2 and
Article XI.

         Section 2.2.     Lease Renewal.  Lessee may elect to renew this Lease
for up to five successive one-year renewal terms (each, a "Renewal Term") as
provided in Article XI.


                                  Article III

                        RENT; OTHER ECONOMIC PROVISIONS

         Section 3.1.     Rent Payments.  On each Payment Date during the
Initial Term and each Renewal Term, Lessee shall pay to Agent for the benefit
of the Lessors the Interim Rent, Basic Rent or Renewal Rent, as applicable,
that has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of each Lease Supplement
entered into prior to such Payment Date.  Scheduled installments of Basic Rent
and Renewal Rent may be adjusted pursuant to Section 6.1.

         Section 3.2.     Place and Manner of Payment.  (a) Rent and all other
sums due Lessors hereunder shall be paid in immediately available funds to
Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, at the Agent's Corporate Office, or at
such other office of Agent as it





                                      2
<PAGE>   93
may from time to time specify to Lessee in a notice pursuant to this Lease.
All such payments shall be received by Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. San
Francisco time, on the date due; funds received after such time shall for all
purposes under the Operative Agreements be deemed to have been received by
Lessor on the next succeeding Business Day.  Lessee shall pay to Agent for the
benefit of the Lessors, on demand, interest (i) with respect to any overdue
amount of Rent or Make-Whole Premium, at the rate per annum which is 2% above
the Interest Rate under the Lease Supplement relating to the Functional Unit in
respect of which such amount is due and (ii) with respect to any other payment
under this Lease that is not paid when due (without taking into account any
applicable grace period), at the rate which is 2% per annum above the Interest
Rate set forth in Schedule II to the Lease Supplement delivered on the Initial
Delivery Date, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) interest from
the date due (not taking into account any grace period) until payment is made.

         (b) Agent shall make all payments to Lessors required under this Lease
or the Participation Agreement on the date the Agent receives the applicable
payment from Lessee, so long as Agent has received such payment from Lessee not
later than 9:00 a.m. San Francisco time, and if Agent receives the applicable
payment from Lessee later than 9:00 a.m. San Francisco time, then Agent shall
make payment to the Lessors on the next succeeding Business Day.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such amounts may be held by the Agent
pending the Agent's reasonable, good faith determination of the Lessor or
Lessors entitled to such payment (and the portion thereof payable to each
Lessor), and shall be paid by the Agent to each Lessor entitled thereto
promptly upon making such determination by transferring such amounts to such
Lessors; provided, however, that if such determination is not made by the end
of the second Business Day following receipt by the Agent of the applicable
payment and the amount of such payment shall exceed, in the aggregate,
$100,000, the Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lessors, invest such
funds in Permitted Investments.

         Section 3.3.     Net Lease.  This Lease is a net lease and Lessee's
obligation to pay all Rent, indemnity and other amounts payable hereunder shall
be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lessee shall not be entitled to any
abatement or reduction of Rent or any setoff against Rent, indemnity or other
amount, whether arising by reason of any past, present or future claims of any
nature by Lessee against Agent or any Lessor, or otherwise.  Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, this Lease shall not terminate, nor shall
the obligations of Lessee be otherwise affected (a) by reason of any defect in,
damage to, or loss of possession or use, obsolescence or destruction, of any or





                                      3
<PAGE>   94
all of the Equipment, however caused; or (b) by the taking or requisitioning of
any or all of the Equipment by condemnation or otherwise; or (c) by the
invalidity or unenforceability or lack of due authorization by Agent, Lessors
or Lessee or other infirmity of this Lease; or (d) by lack of power or
authority of Lessor to enter into this Lease; or (e) by the attachment of any
Lien of any third party to any item of Equipment; or (f) by any prohibition or
restriction of or interference with Lessee's use of any or all of the Equipment
by any Person; or (g) by the insolvency of or the commencement by or against
Lessee, Agent or any Lessor of any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding; or (h) by any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing, any present or future law to the contrary notwithstanding.  It is
the intention of the parties that all Rent, indemnities and other amounts
payable by Lessee hereunder shall be payable in all events in the manner and at
the times herein provided unless Lessee's obligations in respect thereof have
been terminated or modified pursuant to the express provisions of this Lease.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lessee waives any and all rights
which it may now have or which may at any time be conferred upon it, by statute
or otherwise, to terminate, cancel, quit or surrender this Lease, in whole or
in part, except strictly in accordance with the express terms hereof.  Each
rental, indemnity or other payment made by Lessee hereunder shall be final, and
Lessee shall not seek to recover (except as expressly provided in this Lease)
all or any part of such payment from Lessors or the Agent for any reason
whatsoever.


                                   Article IV

                                   WARRANTIES

         Section 4.1.     Warranty Disclaimer.  LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT:  (a) THE EQUIPMENT IS OF A SIZE, DESIGN, CAPACITY AND MANUFACTURE
SELECTED BY LESSEE; (b) LESSEE IS SATISFIED THAT THE SAME IS SUITABLE FOR ITS
PURPOSES; (c) NEITHER AGENT NOR ANY LESSOR IS A MANUFACTURER THEREOF OR A
DEALER IN PROPERTY OF SUCH KIND; AND (d) NEITHER AGENT NOR ANY LESSOR HAS MADE
OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE: (i) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR COVENANT
WITH RESPECT TO THE TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
CONDITION, QUALITY, DESCRIPTION, DURABILITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ITEM OF
EQUIPMENT IN ANY RESPECT OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR FOR THE PURPOSES AND USES OF
LESSEE; OR (ii) ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT, EXCEPT THAT EACH OF THE LESSORS
REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS, SEVERALLY AND NOT JOINTLY, THAT ON EACH DELIVERY DATE
IT SHALL HAVE RECEIVED AN UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN WHATEVER TITLE WAS CONVEYED BY
THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE EQUIPMENT DELIVERED ON SUCH DELIVERY DATE BY





                                      4
<PAGE>   95
SUCH MANUFACTURERS, FREE OF LESSOR LIENS CREATED BY SUCH LESSOR EXCEPT FOR
PERMITTED LESSOR LIENS AND LIENS CREATED PURSUANT TO THE OPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.

         Section 4.2.     Assignment of Warranties.  Lessors assign to Lessee,
to the extent assignable, all of their interest, if any, in any warranties,
covenants and representations of any manufacturer, producer, vendor or maker of
any item of Equipment, provided that such assignment shall remain in effect
only so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
provided, further, that any action taken by Lessee by reason thereof shall be
at the expense of Lessee and shall be consistent with Lessee's obligations
pursuant to this Lease.


                                   Article V

                        POSSESSION, ASSIGNMENT, USE AND
                            MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT

         Section 5.1.     Restriction on Lessee's Possession and Use.  Lessee
shall not (a) use, operate, maintain or store any Functional Unit, item of
Equipment or any portion thereof (i) except in accordance with Section 5.3; or
(ii) in violation of any applicable insurance policy or law or regulation of
any Authority; (b) abandon any item of Equipment; (c) except as permitted by
Section 5.2 and Section 6.1 of the Participation Agreement, sublease or assign,
without the prior written consent of Lessor, any item of Equipment or permit
the use thereof by anyone other than Lessee; (d) except as set forth in Section
5.2 and Section 6.1 of the Participation Agreement, sell, assign or transfer
any of its rights hereunder or in any item of Equipment, or directly or
indirectly create, incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any of its rights
hereunder or in any item of Equipment, except for Permitted Liens; or (e)
except in connection with any maintenance or repair thereof, permit any item of
Equipment or any Part relating to such item of Equipment to be located at any
location other than the location of such Equipment or Part as of the Delivery
Date applicable thereto and as set forth opposite such item of Equipment on
Schedule I of the applicable Lease Supplement.  Lessee will defend the sale of
the Equipment by Lessee and Manufacturers to Agent, for the benefit of the
Lessors, against the claims or demands of all Persons.

         Section 5.2.     Sublease.  Subject to Sections 6.1(a) and 6.2(a) of
the Participation Agreement, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Lessee may sublease one or more Functional Units to a Subsidiary of
Lessee without the prior written consent of Lessors or Agent; provided that (i)
any such sublease shall automatically expire upon the expiration of the Lease
Term or any earlier termination of this Lease and shall





                                      5
<PAGE>   96
be expressly subject and subordinate to this Lease and the Liens created
hereby, (ii) the sublease agreement shall be in writing and shall expressly
prohibit any further assignment, sublease or transfer and (iii) all of Lessee's
rights, title and interest in, to and under the sublease shall be pledged by
Lessee to Lessors, as collateral for Lessee's obligations under the Operative
Agreements, by delivery of an executed copy upon the execution and delivery
thereof, marked as the sole original execution copy for Uniform Commercial Code
purposes, to the Agent, and Lessee shall, at its own cost and expense, do any
further act and execute, acknowledge, deliver, file, register and record any
further documents which the Agent or Lessors may reasonably request in order to
create, perfect, preserve and protect Agent's and Lessors' security interest in
the sublease.  Lessee shall remain primarily liable hereunder for the
performance of all of the terms of this Lease to the same extent as if such
sublease had not been entered into.

         Section 5.3.     Maintenance.  Lessee shall at its own cost and
expense and at all times during the term of this Lease (a) maintain, manage and
monitor the Equipment in compliance with all applicable requirements of any
law, Authority and/or insurance policies; (b) maintain the Equipment (or cause
the Equipment to be maintained) in as good operating order, repair, condition
and appearance as it was on the date such Equipment became subject to this
Lease (assuming that, as of such date, the Equipment was in good operating
order, repair, condition and appearance), ordinary wear and tear excepted; (c)
maintain, manage and monitor the Equipment in accordance with the terms of all
applicable contracts (including, without limitation, service contracts and
insurance contracts); (d) conduct all scheduled maintenance of the Equipment in
conformity with Lessee's past practices, and manufacturer's maintenance and
repair guidelines, for similar equipment (including, without limitation,
Lessee's maintenance program for such equipment); and (e) cause the Equipment
to continue to have at all times the capacity and functional ability to
perform, on a continuing basis (subject to normal interruption in the ordinary
course of business for maintenance, inspection, service, repair and testing)
and in commercial operation, the functions for which it was specifically
designed.  Lessee shall in any event maintain the Equipment (or cause the
Equipment to be maintained) in at least as good a condition as comparable
equipment owned or leased by it or any of its Subsidiaries.  Lessee will
maintain or cause to be maintained and shall permit the Agent and Lessors to
inspect any records, logs and other materials required by any governmental
authority having jurisdiction to be maintained or filed in respect of any items
of Equipment.

         Section 5.4.     Replacement and Substitution.

                 (a)      In the event that any Part which may from time to
         time be incorporated or installed in or attached to any item of
         Equipment, or any item of Equipment itself, becomes at any time worn
         out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond
         repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever
         (unless such event constitutes a Casualty or Partial Casualty, in
         which event the provisions of Section 6.1 or 6.2 hereof shall apply),
         Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace, or cause
         to be replaced, such Part or item of Equipment (the "Substituted Item")
         with a replacement Part or item of Equipment (a "Replacement Part").
         In addition, Lessee may, at its own cost and expense, remove in the
         ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing,
         any Part, whether or not worn out, destroyed, seized, confiscated,
         damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use, provided
         that Lessee will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Part as
         promptly as is commercially reasonable.  All Replacement Parts shall
         be free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and shall
         be in as good an operating condition as, and shall have a value and
         utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced
         Parts and the Equipment were immediately prior to such replacement or
         the event or events necessitating such replacement in the condition
         and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof.  Any Part at
         any time removed from any item of Equipment shall remain subject to
         the interests of the Agent and the Lessors under the Operative
         Agreements, no matter where located, until such time as such Part
         shall be replaced by a Part which has been incorporated or installed
         in or attached to such item of Equipment and which meets the
         requirements for a Replacement Part specified above.  Immediately upon
         any Replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or attached
         to any such item of Equipment as above provided, without further act
         (i) title to the replaced Part shall thereupon vest in Lessee, free
         and clear of all rights of the Lessors, and shall no longer be deemed
         a Part hereunder, (ii) title to such Replacement Part shall thereupon
         vest in the Lessors and (iii) such Replacement Part shall become
         subject to this Lease and the security interest created hereunder and
         be deemed part of such item of Equipment for all purposes hereof to
         the same extent as the Parts incorporated or installed in or attached
         to such item of Equipment on the date such item of Equipment became
         subject to this Lease.  No later than 45 days after the end of each
         fiscal quarter of Lessee, Lessee shall deliver to Lessors a Bill of
         Sale evidencing the conveyance by Lessee to the Lessors of all
         Replacement Parts not previously evidenced by





                                      7
<PAGE>   98
         a Bill of Sale and such other documents in respect of such Part or
         Parts as the Required Lessors may reasonably request in order to
         confirm that title to such Part or Parts has passed to Lessors, as
         provided above.  Each such Bill of Sale shall provide that each Lessor
         is granted an undivided interest in such Replacement Parts equal to
         its Lease Percentage as of the date of such transfer.

                 (b) In addition to the foregoing, Lessee shall have the option
         at any time to replace any Functional Unit (a "Replaced Unit") with a
         substitute Functional Unit (a "Replacement Unit"), subject to the
         following conditions:

                          (i) any such Replacement Unit shall satisfy one of
                 the following conditions:  (x) the Replacement Unit shall
                 consist of items of new equipment of identical manufacture and
                 model as the equipment comprising the Replaced Unit, or (y)
                 such Replacement Unit shall have a utility, an Appraised
                 Value, and an economic useful life at least equal to those of
                 the Replaced Unit immediately prior to such substitution,
                 assuming that the Replaced Unit was in the condition and
                 repair required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease,
                 and Lessee shall have provided to the Agent and each Lessor,
                 at Lessee's expense, an Appraisal satisfactory to Agent and
                 each Lessor in their sole and absolute discretion with respect
                 to the determination of such utility, Fair Market Value and
                 economic useful life or (z) such Replacement Unit shall
                 otherwise be acceptable to each of the Lessors in its
                 respective sole and absolute discretion;

                          (ii) Lessee shall have satisfied each of the
                 conditions set forth in Section 4.3 of the Participation
                 Agreement (other than subsection (b) thereof) with respect to
                 the proposed replacement; and

                          (iii) Lessee shall not remove the Replaced Unit from
                 the location set forth on Schedule I to the Delivery Date
                 Notice pursuant to which the Replaced Unit was delivered until
                 such time as it has executed all documents reasonably
                 requested by Agent or any Lessor to perfect the security
                 interest of the Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, in the
                 Replacement Unit.

         Any Replacement Unit substituted in accordance with this Section
         5.4(b) shall thereafter be considered a Functional Unit for all
         purposes of this Lease.

                 (c)      Lessee may request the replacement of an item of
         Equipment (pursuant to the foregoing subsection (a)) or a Functional
         Unit (pursuant to the foregoing subsection (b) by delivery of a
         Replacement Notice in the manner described in Section 4.3 of the
         Participation Agreement.  Upon the satisfaction of the conditions
         specified in such Section 4.3, each in form and substance satisfactory
         to the Required Lessors, and the Replacement Part or Replacement Unit
         becoming subject to this Lease and the security interest created
         hereunder, Lessor shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill of sale
         (without representations or warranties, except that the Substituted
         Item or Replaced Unit, as the case may be, is free and clear of all
         Lessor Liens) and such other documents as may be required to release
         the Substituted Item or Replaced Unit, as the case may be, from the
         terms and scope of this Lease, in such form as may be reasonably
         requested by Lessee and are in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Lessors, all at Lessee's own cost and expense.

         Section 5.5.     Alterations, Modifications and Additions; Removable
Parts.

                 (a)      Except as provided in Section 5.4, Lessee shall not
         remove, replace, modify, improve or alter (collectively, "alter") any
         item of Equipment or affix or place any Part on any item of Equipment
         if such alteration or addition would materially impair the originally
         intended function or use or materially reduce the value of such item
         of Equipment or the Functional Unit to which such item of Equipment
         belongs, provided that Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will make,
         or cause to be made any alteration or addition to or in respect of any
         item of Equipment that may be necessary, from time to time, to comply
         in all material respects with any applicable law, governmental rule or
         regulation (including any Environmental Law) or any provision of any
         insurance policy required to be maintained under Section 7.1 (any
         Parts being used to comply with this provision shall be hereafter
         referred to as "Mandatory Parts"); provided, however, that Lessee
         shall be under no obligation to take such action so long as the
         application of the applicable law, rule, regulation or provision is
         being contested by Lessee pursuant to a Permitted Contest.  Lessee
         shall notify Agent and the Lessors in advance of any proposed
         alteration of or addition to any item of Equipment if the cost of such
         alteration or addition, in the aggregate, can reasonably be expected
         to exceed $250,000, or if such advance notice is not practicable,
         within 30 days after the completion of such alteration or addition.
         All Parts affixed to or installed as a part on any item of Equipment,
         excluding temporary





                                      9
<PAGE>   100
         replacements, shall thereupon become subject to the security interest
         under this Lease.

                 (b)  If no Event of Default shall exist, Lessee may remove, at
         its own cost and expense, any Part at any time during the term of this
         Lease (such Part, a "Removable Part") which (i) is in addition to, and
         not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part originally
         incorporated or installed in or attached to an item of Equipment on
         the date such item became subject to this Lease or any Part in
         replacement of or substitution for any such Part originally
         incorporated or installed or attached to such Equipment, (ii) is not a
         Mandatory Part and (iii) can be removed from any item of Equipment
         without causing damage to such item of Equipment or diminishing or
         impairing the value, utility or condition that such item of Equipment
         would have had at such time had such addition not occurred, provided
         that (x) such removal will not materially impair the value or use
         which the item of Equipment would have had at such time had such Part
         not been affixed to or placed on such Equipment, (y) such Part is not
         necessary for the continued normal use of such item of Equipment and
         (z) such removal would not cause the Functional Unit to which such
         items of Equipment belong to no longer constitute a Functional Unit.
         Lessee shall repair all damage to the item of Equipment resulting from
         any alteration so as to restore any item of Equipment to the condition
         in which it existed prior to such alteration (ordinary wear and tear
         excepted).  Lessors shall not have any obligation to pay for or to
         reimburse Lessee for any alteration permitted by this Section 5.5.

Title to all Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to any
item of Equipment as the result of alterations, modifications or additions
under this Section 5.5, except Removable Parts, shall, without further act,
vest in Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, in the manner provided in clause
(ii) of Section 5.4(a) and the other applicable provisions of Section 5.4 shall
apply with respect to such Parts.  Title to any Removable Part shall not vest
in Agent, and upon the removal by Lessee of any Removable Part as provided
herein, such Removable Part shall no longer be deemed part of the item of
Equipment from which it was removed.  Any Removable Part not removed by Lessee
as provided herein prior to the end of the Lease Term or applicable Renewal
Term shall become the property of Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, at
such time.

         Section 5.6.     Labeling of Equipment.  Lessee shall as soon as
practicable affix and keep throughout the Lease Term, including any Renewal
Terms, labels, plates or other markings, bearing the inscription "Security
Interest held by BA Leasing &





                                      10
<PAGE>   101
Capital Corporation, as agent for the Lessors" upon a prominent place on each
item of Equipment reasonably susceptible to being so labeled.

         Section 5.7.     Inspection of Collateral.  Agent, the Lessors and
each of their agents and representatives shall have the right at all reasonable
times, upon reasonable notice, to inspect any Collateral.


                                   Article VI

                           RISK OF LOSS; REPLACEMENT

         Section 6.1.     Casualty.  Upon a Casualty, Lessee shall give prompt
written notice thereof (a "Casualty Notice") to Agent and Lessors, which notice
shall specify whether Lessee will:

                 (a)      repay the Functional Unit Balance for each Functional
         Unit subject to such Casualty together with unpaid Accrued Supplement
         Rent on each such Functional Unit Balance so prepaid to the date of
         payment and the applicable Make-Whole Premium on each such Functional
         Unit Balance so repaid.  All such amounts shall be paid to Agent for
         the benefit of the Lessors no later than the next scheduled Payment
         Date occurring at least 30 days after such Casualty, but in no event
         later than the Termination Date (such date being referred to as the
         Casualty Settlement Date"); or

                 (b)      replace pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.4(b)
         hereof and Section 4.3 of the Participation Agreement each Functional
         Unit with respect to which the Casualty has occurred; provided,
         however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or an event
         which with the giving of notice and/or the passage of time could give
         rise to an Event of Default, Lessee shall be obligated, at the option
         of the Required Lessors, to make the payments referred to inclause (a)
         above and shall not be entitled to exercise any right or election of
         replacement as set forth in this clause (b).

         All proceeds of any casualty insurance or condemnation proceeds
("Casualty Proceeds") paid to the Lessee or any of its Affiliates by reason of
a Casualty to a Functional Unit shall be deposited into a deposit account
established by Agent for the benefit of the Lessors (the "Deposit Account").
Any Casualty Proceeds paid to Agent with respect to a Functional Unit suffering
a Casualty shall also be deposited in the Deposit Account.  Any monies in the
Deposit Account attributable to a Casualty shall be remitted promptly to Lessee
after either (i) Lessee's payment in full of the Functional Unit Balance





                                      11
<PAGE>   102
together with the applicable Make-Whole Premium or (ii) Lessee's full
compliance with the conditions governing a Replacement Part, as applicable
pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above.

         If Lessee has elected to pay the Functional Unit Balance and an amount
equal to the applicable Make-Whole Premium pursuant to clause (a) above, Lessee
shall continue to make all payments of Rent due hereunder in respect of the
Functional Unit or Units suffering a Casualty through the date the Functional
Unit Balance and the applicable Make-Whole Premium are paid.  Upon payment of
each of the amounts required by Section 6.1(a), then all scheduled installments
of Rent, including installments of Renewal Rent, thereafter payable for the
remainder of the Lease Term in respect of the Lease Supplement applicable to
the Functional Unit or Units suffering the Casualty, and the portion of the
Purchase Option Exercise Amounts allocable to such Lease Supplement, shall be
re-calculated by the Agent in the manner specified in Section 3.1 of the
Participation Agreement, without taking into account the Purchase Price or
Functional Unit Balance of the Functional Unit suffering the Casualty.

         Section 6.2.     Partial Casualty.  Upon any Partial Casualty with
respect to a Functional Unit, Lessee shall give to Agent and Lessors a Notice
of Partial Casualty.  As soon as practicable after a Partial Casualty, Lessee
shall (a) repair and rebuild the affected portions of such Functional Unit (or
cause such affected portions to be repaired and rebuilt) to the condition
required to be maintained by Section 5.3 hereof, provided that the value and
functional capability of such Functional Unit, as restored, is at least
equivalent to the value and functional capability of such Functional Unit as in
effect immediately prior to the occurrence of such Partial Casualty or (b)
replace such affected items of Equipment with Replacement Parts pursuant to the
provisions of Section 5.4(a).

         Section 6.3.     Partial Casualty Proceeds.  All Partial Casualty
Proceeds received by Lessee or any of its Affiliates as a result of a Partial
Casualty shall be promptly paid to Agent.  Agent shall deposit such Partial
Casualty Proceeds into the Deposit Account and, so long as no Event of Default
or event which with the giving of notice and/or passage of time could give rise
to an Event of Default shall exist, Agent shall disburse such Partial Casualty
Proceeds with respect to a Functional Unit (or an item of Equipment
constituting part of such Functional Unit) suffering a Partial Casualty as
follows:

                 (a)      to Lessee in reimbursement of the costs of repairing
         and rebuilding the affected portions of such Functional Unit (or item
         of Equipment constituting part of such Functional Unit) suffering a
         Partial Casualty which the





                                      12
<PAGE>   103
         Lessee has chosen to repair and rebuild in accordance with Section
         6.2; or

                 (b)      upon a Replacement Part being duly substituted for
         each item of Equipment having suffered a Partial Casualty, to Lessee
         to the extent Partial Casualty Proceeds with respect to the
         corresponding Substituted Item were deposited into the Deposit
         Account.

         Partial Casualty Proceeds held by Agent and to be distributed in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 6.3 shall be disbursed by Agent
from the Deposit Account to Lessee from time to time (but no more frequently
than once per calendar month) to reimburse Lessee for the costs of repairing
and rebuilding the affected Functional Units as required under Section 6.2(a),
subject to such reasonable disbursement conditions as Agent may impose,
including presentation of invoices and other supporting documentation
reflecting such costs and delivery of Lien waivers; provided, however, that
Agent shall have no obligation to disburse any Partial Casualty Proceeds out of
the Deposit Account at any time that Agent, at the direction of the Required
Lessors, shall reasonably determine (i) that such Partial Casualty Proceeds are
not sufficient to repair and rebuild the affected Functional Units as required
by Section 6.2(a) (unless additional funds which are, in the sole discretion of
the Required Lessors, sufficient to so repair and rebuild the affected
Functional Units have been deposited in the Deposit Account) or (ii) that
Lessee is not diligently performing its obligations under Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, and provided that
no Event of Default and no event which with the giving of notice and/or passage
of time could become an Event of Default shall exist, if the aggregate amount
of Partial Casualty Proceeds attributable to any Partial Casualty is $100,000
or less, Lessee may receive such Partial Casualty Proceeds directly, without
delivery to Agent, provided that such Partial Casualty Proceeds are applied in
accordance with the requirements of Section 6.2.  In the event that Agent
receives Partial Casualty Proceeds in an amount that is less than $100,000 and
provided that no Event of Default and no event which with the giving of notice
and/or passage of time could become an Event of Default shall exist, Agent
shall promptly remit such funds to Lessee.  Notwithstanding any Partial
Casualty, all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease (including its
obligation to make all payments of Rent as they become due) shall continue
unabated and in full force and effect as provided in this Lease.

                                  Article VII

                                   INSURANCE

         Section 7.1.     Required Coverages.  Lessee will keep the Equipment
insured by financially sound and reputable insurers against loss or damage,
with insurance of the kinds and in the amounts customarily maintained by
similar corporations engaged in similar operations in similar jurisdictions and
carry such other insurance as is usually carried by such corporations, provided
that in any event Lessee will maintain:

                 (a)      Casualty Insurance -- insurance against risks of
         direct physical loss or damage with respect to the Equipment
         (including, without limitation, earthquake insurance) with deductibles
         and in such minimum amounts as are consistent with industry standards;
         provided, however, that at no time shall the amount of coverage, on a
         replacement cost basis, be less than the sum of (x) the Lease Balance
         and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate portion of the interest
         component of Basic Rent or Renewal Rent to be accrued under all Lease
         Supplements for 90 days following the date of determination;

                 (b)      Public Liability Insurance -- combined single limit
         insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage
         in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 per occurrence with such
         deductibles as are carried by similarly situated companies involved in
         operating similar facilities and equipment; and

                 (c)      Other Insurance -- such other insurance, including
         comprehensive motor vehicle, worker's compensation and business
         interruption insurance, in each case as generally carried by owners of
         equipment similar to the Equipment and properties in the States of
         California, Iowa and Oregon, in such amounts and against such risks as
         are then customary for equipment and property similar in use.

Such insurance shall be written by reputable insurance companies that are
financially sound and solvent and otherwise reasonably appropriate considering
the amount and type of insurance being provided by such companies.  Any
insurance company selected by Lessee which is rated in Best's Insurance Guide
or any successor thereto (or if there be none, an organization having a similar
national reputation) shall have a general policyholder rating of "A" and a
financial rating of at least "10" or be otherwise acceptable to the Required
Lessors.  Property/Casualty insurance maintained by Lessee shall name Agent,
for the benefit of the Lessors, as sole loss payee to the extent such claims
relate to items of Equipment subject to this Lease, and liability insurance





                                      14
<PAGE>   105
maintained by Lessee shall name Agent, together with the Lessors, as additional
insureds.  Each policy referred to in this Section 7.1 shall provide that (i)
it will not be cancelled or its limits reduced, or allowed to lapse without
renewal, except after not less than 30 days' written notice to Agent and the
Lessors, (ii) the interests of Agent and the Lessors shall not be invalidated
by any act or negligence of Lessee or any person having an interest in any item
of Equipment, (iii) such insurance is primary with respect to any other
insurance carried by or available to Agent and the Lessors, (iv) the insurer
shall waive any right of subrogation, setoff, counterclaim, or other deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise, against Agent and the Lessors and (v) such
policy shall contain a cross-liability clause providing for coverage of Agent
and each Lessor as if separate policies had been issued to each of them.
Lessee will notify Agent and Lessors promptly of any policy cancellation,
reduction in policy limits, modification or amendment.

         Section 7.2.     Delivery of Insurance Certificates.  On or before the
Initial Delivery Date and thereafter on each Subsequent Delivery Date, Lessee
shall deliver to Agent (with a copy to each Lessor) certificates of insurance
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessors evidencing the existence of all
insurance required to be maintained hereunder and setting forth the respective
coverages, limits of liability, carrier, policy number and period of coverage.
Thereafter, throughout the Lease Term, no sooner than 10 days before and no
later than on the last day of April (commencing in 1995), Lessee shall deliver
to Agent (with a copy to each Lessor) certificates of insurance evidencing that
all insurance required by Section 7.1 hereof to be maintained by Lessee with
respect to the Equipment subject to this Lease is in effect.  With each such
certificate of insurance (other than certificates delivered in connection with
Delivery Date Closings) Lessee shall cause to be delivered a written report of
a firm of independent insurance brokers of nationally recognized standing,
stating that, in their opinion, such policy is in compliance with the
provisions of Section 7.1 hereof and is comparable in all material respects
with insurance carried by responsible owners and operators of equipment similar
to the Equipment.


                                  Article VIII

                                    DEFAULT

         Section 8.1.     Events of Default.  The following shall constitute
events of default (each an "Event of Default") hereunder (whether any such
event shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be effected by
operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment, decree or
order

of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body):

                 (a)      any payment of Rent shall not be paid when due, or
         any other payment payable by Lessee under any Operative Agreement
         shall not be paid within ten (10) Business Days;

                 (b)      any representation or warranty on the part of Lessee
         contained in any Operative Agreement or in any certificate, letter or
         other writing or instrument furnished or delivered to Agent or the
         Lessors pursuant thereto shall at any time prove to have been
         incorrect in any material respect when made, deemed made or
         reaffirmed, as the case may be;

                 (c)      Lessee shall default in the performance or observance
         of any term, covenant, condition or agreement on its part to be
         performed or observed underSections 5.1(c) or 5.1(d), Section 5.2,
         Article XI, or Section 21.2 hereof;

                 (d)      Lessee shall default in any material respect in the
         performance or observance of any term, covenant, condition or
         agreement on its part to be performed or observed under Section 7.1
         hereof;

                 (e)      Lessee shall default in any material respect in the
         performance or observance of any other term, covenant, condition or
         agreement on its part to be performed or observed hereunder or under
         any other Operative Agreement (and not constituting an Event of
         Default under any other clause of this Section 8.1), and such default
         shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after the earlier to
         occur of (i) written notice thereof by Agent or any Lessor to Lessee
         or (ii) Lessee has Actual Knowledge thereof, provided that if such
         failure cannot be remedied within such 30-day period and Lessee is
         diligently proceeding, as determined in the absolute discretion of the
         Required Lessors, to correct such failure of performance and such
         failure of performance is capable of being remedied within a single
         additional 30-day period, such period shall be extended for an
         additional 30 days;

                 (f)      (i) Lessee shall generally fail to pay, or admit in
         writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due, or shall
         voluntarily commence any case or proceeding or file any petition under
         any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law seeking dissolution,
         liquidation or reorganization or the appointment of a receiver, agent,
         custodian or liquidator for itself or a substantial portion of its
         property, assets or business or to effect a plan or other arrangement

         similar process shall not be released, vacated or fully bonded within
         60 days after commencement, filing or levy, as the case may be;

                 (h)      a contribution failure occurs with respect to any
         Pension Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) sufficient to give rise
         to a lien under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code

         obligation, or as a result of an event of default, the maturity of an
         indebtedness (including, without limitation, the indebtedness under

         accelerated prior to its express maturity,provided that the aggregate
         of all such defaulted payments and/or accelerations of principal
         exceeds $5,000,000 or more;

                 (k)      a judgment or judgments for the payment of money are

         performance or observance of the covenants set forth in Sections 6.10,
         6.11, 6.12, 6.13 or 6.14 of the Credit Agreement as these Sections are
         in effect on the Expiration Date, it being understood that, for
         purposes of thisSection 8.1(l), the aforementioned covenants and the
         related definitions and ancillary provisions from the Credit Agreement
         shall be incorporated by reference herein for the benefit of the
         Lessors and Agent and shall be treated as having survived any
         termination of the Credit Agreement so long as any obligation of
         Lessee may be due and owing under any Operative Agreement.

         Section 8.2.     Remedies.  If any Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Agent, on behalf of the Lessors as provided for in Article XII,
may exercise in any order one or





                                      18
<PAGE>   109
more or all of the remedies set forth in this Section 8.2 (it being understood
that no remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy
or remedies, but each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given herein or now or hereafter existing at law
or in equity or by statute, including without limitation any applicable Uniform
Commercial Code).

                 (a)      Agent may proceed by appropriate court action or
         actions, either at law or in equity, to enforce performance by Lessee
         of the applicable covenants of this Lease or to recover damages for
         the breach thereof.

                 (b)      Agent (with the consent of the Required Lessors) may
         by notice in writing to Lessee terminate this Lease, but Lessee shall
         remain liable as hereinafter provided; and Agent may do any one or
         more of the following, as instructed by the Required Lessors: (i)
         declare the Lease Balance, all unpaid Accrued Rent, all other amounts
         then due and payable by Lessee under this Lease and the other
         Operative Agreements and an amount equal to the Aggregate Make-Whole
         Premium to be immediately due and payable, and recover any other
         damages and expenses (including the costs and expenses described in
         Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 11.5 of the Participation Agreement) in addition
         thereto which Lessor shall have sustained by reason of such Event of
         Default, (ii) enforce the security interest given hereunder pursuant
         to the Uniform Commercial Code or any other law, (iii) enter upon the
         premises where any item of Equipment may be and either remove such
         Equipment (or any portion thereof), with any damage to the
         improvements upon which the Equipment may be attached to be borne by
         Lessee, or take possession of the Equipment and (iv) require Lessee to
         disassemble and return the Equipment as provided in Article IX hereof.

                 (c)      Agent may require Lessee immediately to purchase the
         Equipment for a purchase price equal to the sum of the Lease Balance,
         all unpaid Accrued Rent, an amount equal to the Aggregate Make-Whole
         Premium and all other amounts then due and payable under the Operative
         Agreements.

                 (d)      If an Event of Default set forth in Section 8.1(a) (a
         "Payment Default") shall have occurred, any Lessor may declare the
         Lease Balance immediately due and payable by giving written notice to
         Agent, Lessee and each other Lessor, whereupon the unpaid Lease
         Balance together with the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, and
         all unpaid Accrued Rent shall become immediately due and payable
         without further act or notice of any kind.  If an Event of Default set
         forth in Sections 8.1(f) or 8.1(g) (an "Insolvency Defaul") shall have
         occurred, the unpaid Lease Balance





                                      19
<PAGE>   110
         together with the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, and all unpaid
         Accrued Rent shall become immediately due and payable without further
         act or notice of any kind.  If an Event of Default other than an
         Insolvency Default or a Payment Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing, the Agent, with the consent of the Required Lessors, may
         declare the Lease (and each Lease Supplement) to be terminated and all
         payments thereunder to be due and payable immediately by giving
         written notice to Agent, Lessee and each Lessor, whereupon the unpaid
         Lease Balance together with the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any,
         and all unpaid Accrued Rent shall become immediately due and payable
         without further act or notice of any kind.  Nothing contained in this
         Section 8.2 shall limit the application of Article XXVIII in
         accordance with its terms.

Except for notices expressly otherwise provided for in the Operative
Agreements, Lessee hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any
kind including, without limitation, notices of default, notice of acceleration
and notice of intent to accelerate.

         Section 8.3.     Additional Remedies.  In addition to the remedies set
forth in Section 8.2, if any Event of Default shall occur, Agent shall, if
instructed by the Required Lessors, sell the Collateral in one or more sales;
provided, Lessors shall have no liability to Lessee if they fail to instruct
Agent to conduct such a sale.  Any Lessor or Agent may purchase all or any part
of the Collateral at such sale.  Lessee acknowledges that sales for cash or on
credit to a wholesaler, retailer or user of such Collateral, at a public or
private auction, are all commercially reasonable.  Any notice required by law
of intended disposition by Agent shall be deemed reasonable and properly given
if given at least 10 days before such disposition.

         Section 8.4.     Proceeds of Sale; Deficiency.  All payments received
and amounts held or realized by Agent at any time when an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, as well as all payments or amounts then
held or thereafter received by Agent, shall be distributed forthwith upon
receipt by Agent in the following order of priority:

                 first:  so much of such payments or amounts as shall be
         required to pay the reasonable fees and compensation of Agent in
         connection with acting as Agent not previously paid by Lessee shall be
         distributed to Agent;

                 second:  so much of such payments or amounts as shall be
         required to reimburse first Agent and then any Lessor for any tax
         (except as excluded pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Participation
         Agreement), expense or other amount owed to





                                      20
<PAGE>   111
         Agent (in its capacity as Agent) or any Lessor in connection with the
         collection or distribution of such payments or amounts to the extent
         not previously reimbursed by Lessee (including, without limitation,
         the expenses of any sale, taking or other proceeding, expenses in
         connection with realizing on any of the Collateral, reasonable
         attorneys' fees and expenses (including the allocated costs of
         internal counsel), court costs and any other reasonable expenditures
         incurred or reasonable expenditures or advances made by Agent (in its
         capacity as Agent) or any Lessor in the protection, exercise or
         enforcement of any right, power or remedy upon such Event of Default
         whether pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise) shall be so applied by
         Agent first to itself and then to Lessors; and in case the aggregate
         amount so to be paid to the Lessors in accordance herewith shall be
         insufficient to pay all such amounts as aforesaid, then ratably,
         without priority of one such Person over the other, in the proportion
         that the amount which would have been distributed to each such Person
         pursuant to this provision but for such insufficiency bears to the
         aggregate amount which would have been distributed to all Persons
         except for such insufficiency;

                 third:  (i)  so much of such payments or amounts remaining as
         shall be required to reimburse the then existing or prior Lessors for
         payments or deposits pursuant to Article XII (to the extent not
         previously reimbursed and to the extent not constituting an indemnity
         paid or payable for an act constituting gross negligence or willful
         misconduct) shall be distributed to the then existing or prior
         Lessors, ratably, without priority of one over the other, in
         accordance with the amount of the payments or deposits made by each
         such then existing or prior Lessor pursuant to such Article XII; and
         (ii) so much of such payments or amounts remaining as shall be
         required to pay the then existing or prior Lessors the amounts payable
         to them pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.5 hereof or Section
         11.5 of the Participation Agreement and the amounts of all other
         unpaid obligations then due and payable to them hereunder and under
         the Participation Agreement (other than obligations covered by clause
         fourth of this Section 8.4) shall be distributed to each Lessor
         (including its predecessor holders thereof) entitled thereto; and in
         case the aggregate amount so to be paid in accordance with clauses (i)
         and (ii) above shall be insufficient to pay all such amounts as
         aforesaid, then, ratably, without priority of one such Person over the
         other, in the proportion that the amount which would have been
         distributed to each such Person pursuant to this clause third but for
         such insufficiency bears to the aggregate amount which would have





                                      21
<PAGE>   112
         been distributed to all such Persons pursuant to this clause third but
         for such insufficiency;

                 fourth:  so much of such payments or amounts remaining as
         shall be required to pay in full each Lessor's Lease Percentage of the
         aggregate unpaid Lease Balance, the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if
         any, and all accrued but unpaid Accrued Rent (including, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law, interest on interest) shall be
         distributed to the Lessors, and in case the aggregate amount to be so
         distributed shall be insufficient to pay the unpaid Lease Balance, the
         Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, and all accrued but unpaid
         Accrued Rent in full all as aforesaid, then, ratably, without priority
         of one over the other, in the proportions that each Lessor's Lease
         Percentage of aggregate unpaid Lease Balance, the Aggregate Make-Whole
         Premium, if any, then due and payable and all accrued but unpaid
         Accrued Rent to the date of distribution bears to the aggregate unpaid
         Lease Balance, the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, due and
         payable and all accrued but unpaid Accrued Rent to the date of
         distribution under the Lease; and

                 fifth:  so much of such payments or amounts as shall remain
         shall be distributed to Lessee.

         Section 8.5.     Right to Perform Lessee's Agreements.  If Lessee
fails to perform any of its agreements contained herein or in any other
Operative Agreement, whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Agent, upon written instructions from the Required Lessors and
receipt by Agent of indemnification satisfactory to it, may perform such
agreement and the fees and expenses incurred by Agent (or one or more Lessors)
in connection with such performance together with interest thereon shall be
payable by Lessee upon demand.  Interest on fees and expenses so incurred by
Agent or one or more Lessors shall accrue at the rate provided in Section 3.2
for overdue payments.


                                   Article IX

                              RETURN OF EQUIPMENT

         If Agent, upon the instruction of the Required Lessors, shall
rightfully demand possession of the Equipment pursuant to this Lease, Lessee,
at its expense, shall forthwith disassemble, package to facilitate reassembly
and deliver exclusive possession of such Equipment to Agent at a location
designated by Agent, together with a copy of an inventory list of the Equipment
then subject to the Lease, all then current plans, specifications and





                                      22
<PAGE>   113
operating, maintenance and repair manuals relating to the Equipment that have
been received or prepared by Lessee, appropriately protected and in the
condition required by Section 5.3 hereof, to Agent.  In addition, if this Lease
has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.2, Lessee shall maintain the
Equipment in the condition required by Section 5.3, store the Equipment without
cost to the Agent or any Lessor and keep all of the Equipment insured in
accordance with Article VII for 90 days after redelivery thereof.


                                   Article X

                               EARLY TERMINATION

         If no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice and/or
passage of time could become an Event of Default shall exist, on any Payment
Date after the first Renewal Term, Lessee may, at its option, by giving at
least 30 days advance written notice to Agent and the Lessors, purchase all,
but not less than all, of the Equipment for the sum of (i) all unpaid Accrued
Rent due and payable on or prior to such Payment Date, (ii) the Lease Balance
(after taking into account all payments actually made pursuant to clause (i)),
(iii) an amount equal to the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, and (iv) all other
fees and expenses then due and payable pursuant to this Lease and the other
Operative Agreements.  Upon the payment of such sums by Lessee in accordance
with the provisions of the preceding sentence, the obligation of Lessee to pay
Rent hereunder shall cease, the term of this Lease shall end on the date of
such payment and Agent shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill of sale
(without representations or warranties, except that the Equipment is free and
clear of Lessor Liens) and such other documents as may be required to release
the Equipment from the terms and scope of this Lease, in such form as may be
reasonably requested by Lessee, all at Lessee's own cost and expense.


                                   Article XI

                               LEASE TERMINATION

         Section 11.1.    Lessee's Options.  Not later than 270 days prior to
the last day of the Initial Term, or of any Renewal Term then in effect
hereunder (other than the fifth Renewal Term in the case of paragraph (a)
below), Lessee shall by delivery of written notice to the Agent and Lessors,
exercise either the Renewal Option, on the one hand, or the Lessee Purchase
Option or the Sale Option, or a combination of both, on the other hand, all in
accordance with the terms set forth below:





                                      23
<PAGE>   114
                 (a)      Renew this Lease as to all of the Equipment for an
         additional one year Renewal Term (the "Renewal Option") on the terms
         and conditions set forth herein and in each Lease Supplement;

                 (b)  Purchase for cash all or one or more Functional Units
         then subject to this Lease on the last day of the Initial Term or
         Renewal Term with respect to which such option is exercised (the
         Lessee Purchase Option").  If Lessee elects to exercise the Lessee
         Purchase Option with respect to all of the Functional Units then
         subject to this Lease, Lessee shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of
         the Lessors, the Purchase Option Exercise Amount, the Aggregate
         Make-Whole Premium (provided such premium shall not be due if such
         option is exercised at the end of the fifth Renewal Term) and any
         other amounts then due and payable by Lessee under the Lease or any
         other Operative Agreement.  If Lessee elects to exercise the Lessee
         Purchase Option with respect to Functional Units comprising less than
         all of the Functional Units then subject to this Lease, (A) Lessee
         shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, together with all
         Rent then due and payable the sum of the following amounts:

                          (i) the applicable Make-Whole Premium with respect to
                 each Functional Unit subject to the Lessee Purchase Option
                 (provided such premium shall not be due if such option is
                 exercised at the end of the fifth Renewal Term), and

                          (ii) with respect to each Functional Unit subject to
                 the Lessee Purchase Option, the greater of (x) the Functional
                 Unit Balance of such Functional Unit to be purchased or (y)
                 the Appraised Value of such Functional Unit at the date of
                 purchase, provided that in no event shall Lessee be required
                 to pay to Agent an amount greater than the Lease Balance
                 (after application of Proceeds pursuant to subsection (c)
                 below) plus the applicable Make-Whole Premiums if due as
                 provided for above and any other amounts then due and payable
                 by Lessee under the Lease and (B) Lessee shall be deemed to
                 have elected the Sale Option (defined below) with respect to
                 all of the remaining Functional Units, provided, however that
                 if after the Lessee's election of the Lessee Purchase Option
                 the total Purchase Price of the remaining Functional Units
                 represents less than 20% of the total Purchase Price of all
                 Functional Units subject to the Lease immediately prior to the
                 purchases contemplated by Sections 11.1(b) and 11.1(c), Lessee
                 shall be treated as having made the Lessee Purchase Option
                 with respect to all of the Functional Units;





                                      24
<PAGE>   115
                 (c)  (1)  Sell on behalf of Lessors on the Termination Date
         for cash, to a purchaser or purchasers not in any way affiliated with
         Lessee, the Functional Units not purchased by Lessee pursuant to the
         Lessee Purchase Option (the Sale Option"); provided, howeve, that
         Lessee may exercise the Sale Option only with respect to Functional
         Units whose aggregate Purchase Price represents at least 20% of the
         total Purchase Price of all Functional Units then subject to the
         Lease.  If Lessee elects the Sale Option with respect to Functional
         Units comprising less than all of the Functional Units then subject to
         this Lease, Lessee shall be deemed to have elected the Lessee Purchase
         Option with respect to all of the remaining Functional Units.

                          (2)  Simultaneously with dispositions pursuant to the
         Sale Option, Lessee shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of the
         Lessors, from the gross proceeds of such sales, without deductions or
         expense reimbursements (the Proceeds"), the Lease Balance as of the
         Termination Date (as determined after any payment of Rent due on such
         date) plus the applicable Make-Whole Premiums (except that no
         Make-Whole Premiums shall be payable by Lessee on Functional Units
         sold pursuant to an exercise of the Sale Option with respect to the
         second, fourth or fifth Renewal Term) and any other amounts then due
         and payable under any of the Operative Agreements.  If the Proceeds
         exceed the sum of the Lease Balance as of the Termination Date, plus
         applicable Make-Whole Premiums as of such date and any other payments
         then due and payable under any of the Operative Agreements, Lessee
         will retain the portion of the Proceeds in excess thereof.  If the
         Proceeds are less than the sum of the Lease Balance as of the
         Termination Date plus applicable Make-Whole Premiums as of such date
         and any other payments then due and payable under any of the Operative
         Agreements, Lessee will pay or will cause to be paid to Agent, for the
         benefit of the Lessors, on the Termination Date (i) the Proceeds and
         (ii) from its own funds, the sum of any payments then due and payable
         under any of the Operative Agreements, including any installments of
         Rent then due and payable, applicable Make-Whole Premiums (except that
         no Make-Whole Premiums shall be payable by Lessee on Functional Units
         sold pursuant to an exercise of the Sale Option with respect to the
         second, fourth or fifth Renewal Term) plus, at the option of the
         Required Lessors, either (x) the Applicable Percentage Amount or (y)
         the Recourse Deficiency Amount (the amount determined pursuant to this
         clause (ii) shall be referred to as the "Sale Recourse Amount");
         provided that in no event shall the Sale Recourse Amount exceed the
         Lease Balance and the applicable Make-Whole Premiums, if required
         above, after taking into account all payments of Rent and Proceeds.
         Agent, upon instruction of





                                      25
<PAGE>   116
         the Required Lessors, shall exercise the option in the preceding
         sentence by written notification to Lessee not later than ten Business
         Days prior to the last day of the Lease Term.  The obligation of
         Lessee to pay the Sale Recourse Amount shall be a recourse obligation
         of Lessee (and shall be in addition to any other recourse obligation
         of Lessee under any other provision of the Operative Agreements) and
         shall be payable on the date provided for in the preceding sentence.
         The Sale Recourse Amount and all Proceeds paid to Agent for the direct
         benefit of the Lessors shall be distributed in accordance withArticle
         XXVIII.

         Section 11.2.    Election of Options.  Lessee's election of any of the
foregoing options in Section 11.1 shall be irrevocable at the time made, but if
Lessee fails to make a timely election, Lessee will be deemed, in the case of
the Initial Term and each Renewal Term then in effect (other than the fifth
Renewal Term) to have irrevocably elected the Renewal Option and, in the case
of the fifth Renewal Term, Lessee will be deemed to have irrevocably elected
the Lessee Purchase Option with respect to all of the Functional Units then
subject to this Lease.  In addition, if there exists an Event of Default at any
time after the Sale Option is properly elected, the Sale Option shall
automatically be revoked and Lessor shall be entitled to exercise all rights
and remedies provided in Article VIII.  Lessee may not elect the Sale Option if
there exists on the date the election is made an Event of Default or an event
which with the giving of notice and/or passage of time could become an Event of
Default.

         Section 11.3.    Sale Option Procedures.  If Lessee elects the Sale
Option, Lessee shall use its best commercial efforts to obtain the highest all
cash purchase price for the Functional Units subject to the Sale Option.  All
costs related to such sale and delivery, including, without limitation, the
cost of sales agents, removal of such Equipment, delivery of documents and
Equipment, certification and testing of such Equipment in any location chosen
by the buyer or prospective buyer, legal costs, costs of notices, any
advertisement or other similar costs, or other information and of any parts,
configurations, repairs or modifications desired by a buyer or prospective
buyer shall be borne entirely by Lessee, without regard to whether such costs
were incurred by Agent, the Lessors, Lessee or any potentially qualified buyer.
Neither Agent nor Lessors shall have any responsibility for procuring any
purchaser.  If, nevertheless, any Lessor, or Agent, at the direction of the
Required Lessors, undertakes any sales efforts, Lessee shall promptly reimburse
Agent or such Lessor for any charges, costs or expenses incurred in such
effort, including any allocated time charges, costs or expenses of internal
counsel or other attorneys' fees.  Equipment subject to the Sale Option shall
be in the condition required by Section 5.3 hereof at the time of the sale.
Agent, at the





                                      26
<PAGE>   117
direction of the Required Lessors, shall determine whether to accept the
highest all cash offer for the Equipment subject to the Sale Option.  Any
purchaser or purchasers of the Equipment shall not in any way be affiliated
with Lessee.  Pending the consummation of the Sale Option, Lessee shall at all
times maintain the Equipment in the condition required by Section 5.3, store
the Equipment without cost to the Lessors and keep all of the Equipment insured
in accordance with Article VII hereof.

         Section 11.4.    Payment of Excess Amounts.  Following the application
of all amounts required pursuant to Section 11.2, if the Appraised Value of any
Functional Unit sold pursuant to the Sale Option (without taking into account
any removal costs) as of the Termination Date is in excess of the Proceeds
attributable to any such Functional Unit, Lessee shall promptly pay to Agent,
for the benefit of the Lessors, such excess.

         Section 11.5.    Appraisals.  If Lessee gives notice of exercise of
the Sale Option with respect to one or more Functional Units, Agent (upon
direction from any Lessor) shall engage an appraiser of nationally recognized
standing reasonably acceptable to the Required Lessors, at Lessee's expense, to
determine (by appraisal methods satisfactory to Lessors holding at least 66.67%
of the Outstanding Investments in their sole and absolute discretion) the Fair
Market Value of the Equipment subject to the Sale Option as of (a) the first
day of any Renewal Term in which the Sale Option was elected, and (b) the
Termination Date.  The Appraised Value determined pursuant to this Section 11.5
shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Article XI.

                                     AGENT

         Section 12.1.    Appointment of Agent; Powers and Authorization to
Take Certain Actions.

                 (a)      Each Lessor irrevocably appoints and authorizes BA
         Leasing & Capital Corporation to act as agent hereunder, with such
         powers as are specifically delegated to Agent by the terms of this
         Lease, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
         thereto.  Each Lessor authorizes and directs Agent to, and Agent
         agrees for the benefit of the Lessors, that, on each Delivery Date it
         will accept the documents described in Articles II and III of the
         Participation Agreement.  Agent accepts the agency hereby created
         applicable to it and agrees to receive all payments and proceeds
         pursuant to this Lease and disburse such payments or proceeds in
         accordance with this Lease.  Agent





                                      27
<PAGE>   118
         shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set
         forth in this Lease and the Participation Agreement.  Agent shall not
         be responsible to any Lessor (or to any other Person) (i) for any
         recitals, statements, representations or warranties of any party
         contained in this Lease, the Participation Agreement, or in any
         certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or
         received by any of them under, this Lease or the other Operative
         Agreements, other than the representations and warranties made by
         Agent in Section 5.3 of the Participation Agreement, or (ii) for the
         value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
         sufficiency of the Collateral or the title thereto (subject to the
         Agent's obligations under Section 6.3 of the Participation Agreement)
         or of this Lease or any other document referred to or provided for
         herein or (iii) for any failure by Lessee, any Lessor or any other
         third party (other than Agent) to perform any of its obligations
         hereunder.  Agent may employ agents, trustees or attorneys-in-fact,
         may vest any of them with any property, title, right or power deemed
         necessary for the purposes of such appointment and shall not be
         responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any of them selected
         by it with reasonable care.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors,
         officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any
         action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, or in
         connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or
         willful misconduct.

                 (b)      Agent shall not have any duty or obligation to
         manage, control, use, operate, store, lease, sell, dispose of or
         otherwise deal with any item of Equipment or this Lease, or to
         otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in
         connection with, this Lease or any related document to which Agent is
         a party, except as expressly provided by the terms hereof, and no
         implied duties of any kind shall be read into this Lease against
         Agent.  The permissive right of Agent to take actions enumerated in
         this Lease shall never be construed as a duty, unless Agent is
         instructed or directed to exercise, perform or enforce one or more
         rights by the Required Lessors (provided that Agent has received
         indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it).  Subject to Section
         12.1(c) below, no provision of this Lease shall require Agent to
         expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
         liability in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, or
         in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder.  It is
         understood and agreed that the duties of Agent are ministerial in
         nature.

                 (c)      Except as specifically provided herein, Agent is
         acting hereunder solely as agent and, except as specifically





                                      28
<PAGE>   119
         provided herein, is not responsible to any party hereto in its
         individual capacity, except with respect to any claim arising from
         Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct or any breach of a
         representation or covenant made in its individual capacity.

                 (d)      Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to and
         otherwise deal with Lessee or any of its Affiliates with the same
         rights as it would have if it were not the named Agent hereunder.

         Section 12.2.    Reliance.  Agent may rely upon, and shall not be
bound or obligated to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated
in, any certificate, notice or other communication (including any communication
by telephone, telecopy, telex, telegram or cable) reasonably believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been made, signed or sent by or on behalf of
the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent with due care
(including any expert selected by Agent to aid Agent in any calculations
required in connection with its duties under this Lease).

         Section 12.3.    Action Upon Instructions Generally.  Subject to
Sections 8.2(d), 12.4 and 12.6, upon written instructions of the Required
Lessors, Agent shall, on behalf of the Lessors, give such notice or direction,
exercise such right, remedy or power hereunder or in respect of any item of
Equipment, and give such consent or enter into such amendment to any document
to which it is a party as Agent as may be specified in such instructions.
Agent shall deliver to each Lessor a copy of each notice, report and
certificate received by Agent described in Article X and Sections 5.4, 5.5,
6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 and 11.1 hereof and Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the
Participation Agreement.  Agent shall have no obligation to investigate or
determine whether there has been an Event of Default or an event which with the
passage of time and/or the giving of notice could result in an Event of
Default.  Agent shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of an Event of
Default or event which with the passage of time and/or the giving of notice
could result in an Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of Agent is
notified in writing of such Event of Default or event which with the passage of
time and/or the giving of notice could result in an Event of Default, provided
that Agent shall be deemed to have been notified in writing of any failure of
Lessee to pay Rent in the amounts and at the times set forth in Article III.
If Agent receives notice of an Event of Default, Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof, at Lessee's expense, to each Lessor.  Subject to Sections 8.2(d), 12.4
and 12.6 and Article XVII, Agent shall take action or refrain from taking
action with respect to such Event of Default as directed by the Required
Lessors; provided that, unless and





                                      29
<PAGE>   120
until Agent receives such directions, Agent shall refrain from taking any
action with respect to such Event of Default.  Prior to the date the Lease
Balance shall have become due and payable by acceleration pursuant to Section
8.2, Required Lessors may deliver written instructions to the Agent to waive,
and Agent shall waive pursuant thereto, any Event of Default and its
consequences;  provided that in the absence of written instructions from all
Lessors, Agent shall not waive any (i) Payment Default or (ii) covenant or
provision which, under Section 10.1 of the Participation Agreement, cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of all Lessors.  As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Lease, Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with
instructions signed by the Required Lessors and such instructions of the
Required Lessors and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding on each Lessor.

         Section 12.4.    Indemnification.  Each Lessor shall reimburse and
hold Agent harmless, ratably in accordance with its Lease Percentage at the
time the indemnification is required to be given, (but only to the extent that
any such indemnified amounts have not in fact been paid to Agent by, or on
behalf of, the Lessee in accordance with Section 7.1 of the Participation
Agreement) from any and all claims, losses, damages, obligations, penalties,
liabilities, demands, suits, judgments, or causes of action, and all legal
proceedings, and any reasonable costs or expenses in connection therewith,
including allocated charges, costs and expenses of internal counsel of Agent
and all other reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Agent, in any
way relating to or arising in any manner out of (i) this Lease or any other
Operative Agreement, the enforcement hereof or thereof or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (ii) instructions from the
Required Lessors (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses that
Lessee is obligated to and does not pay hereunder, but excluding normal
administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance by Agent of its
agency duties hereunder other than materially increased administrative costs
and expenses incurred as a result of an Event of Default), provided that no
Lessor shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from
(a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent, (b) the inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty or breach of any covenant given by Agent in
Section 5.3 or in Section 6.3 of the Participation Agreement or in this Lease,
(c) in the case of the Agent's handling of funds, the failure to act with the
same care as the Agent uses in handling its own funds or (d) any taxes, fees or
other charges payable by the Agent based on or measured by any fees,
commissions or compensation received by it for acting as Agent in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements.

<PAGE>   121
         Section 12.5.    Independent Credit Investigation.  Each Lessor by
entering into this Lease agrees that it has, independently and without reliance
on Agent or any other Lessor and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of Lessee and its own
decision to enter into this Lease and all related documents to which it is a
party and that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any
other Lessor, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking action under this Lease and any related documents to which it is a
party.  Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by Lessee of any other document referred to (directly
or indirectly) or provided for herein or to inspect the properties or books of
Lessee.  Except for notices or statements which Agent is expressly required to
give under this Lease and for notices, reports and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to Agent alone (and not also to
each Lessor, it being understood that Agent shall forward copies of same to
each Lessor) hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement, Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lessor with copies of notices or
with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial
condition or business of Lessee (or any of its affiliates) that may come into
the possession of Agent or any of its Affiliates.

         Section 12.6.    Refusal to Act.  Except for notices and actions
expressly required of Agent hereunder and except for the performance of its
covenants in Section 6.3 of the Participation Agreement, Agent shall in all
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act unless (a) it is
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lessors against any and all
liability and reasonable expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action (provided that such indemnity
shall not be required to extend to liability or expense arising from Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct, it being understood that no action
taken, or not taken, by Agent in accordance with the instructions of the
Required Lessors shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part) and (b) it is reasonably satisfied that such action is
not contrary to this Lease or any other Operative Agreement or to any
applicable law.

         Section 12.7.    Resignation or Removal of Agent; Appointment of
Successor.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to each
Lessor or may be removed at any time by written notice from the Required
Lessors.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lessors at the
time of the resignation or removal shall have the right to appoint a





                                      31
<PAGE>   122
successor Agent which shall be a financial institution having a combined
capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000.  If, within 30 calendar days
after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or receipt of a
written notice of removal, a successor Agent is not so appointed and does not
accept such appointment, then the retiring or removed Agent may appoint a
successor Agent and transfer to such successor Agent all rights and obligations
of the retiring Agent.  Such successor Agent shall be a financial institution
having combined capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000.  Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent and the
retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from duties and obligations as
Agent thereafter arising hereunder and under any related document.  If the
retiring Agent does not appoint a successor, any Lessor shall be entitled to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such appointment, and such court
may thereupon appoint a successor to act until such time, if any, as a
successor shall have been appointed as above provided.

         Section 12.8.    Separate Agent.  The Required Lessors may, and if
they fail to do so at any time when they are so required, Agent may, for the
purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any item
of Equipment or Collateral may be located, appoint one or more individuals or
corporations either to act as co-agent jointly with Agent or to act as separate
agent of all or any part of the items of Equipment or Collateral or this Lease,
and vest in such individuals or corporations, in such capacity, such title to
the items of Equipment or Collateral or this Lease or any part thereof, and
such rights or duties as Agent may consider necessary or desirable.  Agent
shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is
not now so qualified.  Agent shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
instruments as may be required by any such co-agent or separate agent more
fully confirming such title, rights or duties to such co-agent or separate
agent.  Upon the acceptance in writing of such appointment by any such co-agent
or separate agent, it or he shall be vested with such interest in the items of
Equipment or Collateral and this Lease or any part thereof, and with such
rights and duties, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Lease, as shall
be specified in the instrument of appointment, jointly with Agent (except
insofar as local law makes it necessary for any such co-agent or separate agent
to act alone), subject to all terms of this Lease.  Any co-agent or separate
agent, to the fullest extent permitted by legal requirements of the relevant
jurisdiction, at any time, by an instrument in writing, shall constitute Agent
its attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power and authority to do all acts
and things and to





                                      32
<PAGE>   123
exercise all discretion on its behalf and in its name.  If any co-agent or
separate agent shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, the
interest in the items of Equipment or Collateral and this Lease and all rights
and duties of such co-agent or separate agent shall, so far as permitted by
law, vest in and be exercised by Agent, without the appointment of a successor
to such co-agent or separate agent.

         Section 12.9.    Termination of Agency.  The agency created hereby
shall terminate upon the final disposition by Agent of all Collateral at any
time subject hereto and the final distribution by Agent of all monies or other
property or proceeds received pursuant to this Lease in accordance with Article
XXVIII, provided that at such time Lessee shall have complied fully with all
the terms hereof.

         Section 12.10.   Compensation of Agency.  Lessee shall pay Agent its
reasonable and customary fees, costs and expenses for the performance of
Agent's obligations hereunder.


                                  Article XIII

                          OWNERSHIP, GRANT OF SECURITY
                        INTEREST AND FURTHER ASSURANCES

         Section 13.1.    Grant of Security Interest.  Title to the Equipment
shall remain in the Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, as security for the
obligations of Lessee hereunder and under each of the other Operative
Agreements to which it is a party until such time as Lessee has fulfilled all
of its obligations hereunder and under such other Operative Agreements.  Lessee
hereby assigns, grants and pledges to Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, a
security interest in all of Lessee's right, title and interest, whether now or
hereafter existing or acquired, in the Collateral, to secure the payment and
performance of all obligations of Lessee now or hereafter existing under this
Lease or any other Operative Agreement.  Lessee shall, at its own cost and
expense, do any further act and execute, acknowledge, deliver, file, register
and/or record any further documents which Agent or any Lessor may reasonably
request in order to protect its or their title to and perfected security
interest in the Collateral, subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens, and
Agent's or Lessor's rights and benefits under this Lease.  Lessee shall
promptly and duly execute and deliver to Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors,
such documents and assurances and take such further action as Agent or Lessors
may from time to time reasonably request in order to carry out more effectively
the intent and purpose of this Lease and the other Operative Agreements, to
establish and protect the rights and remedies created or intended to be created
in favor of





                                      33
<PAGE>   124
Lessors and Agent hereunder and thereunder, and to establish, perfect and
maintain the right, title and interest of Agent or Lessors in and to the
Equipment, subject to no Lien other than Permitted Liens, or of such financing
statements, fixture filings, certificates of title or other documents with
respect hereto as Agent may from time to time reasonably request, and Lessee
agrees to execute and deliver promptly such of the foregoing financing
statements, fixture filings and certificates of title or other documents as may
require execution by Lessee.  To the extent permitted by applicable laws,
Lessee hereby authorizes any such financing statements, fixture filings and
certificates of title to be filed without the necessity of the signature of
Lessee.  Upon Lessee's request and at such time as all of the obligations of
Lessee under this Lease and any other Operative Agreement have been
indefeasibly paid or performed in full (other than Lessee's contingent
obligations, if any, under Articles VII and VIII of the Participation
Agreement), Agent shall, and Agent is hereby authorized by Lessors to act on
their behalf to, execute and deliver termination statements and other
appropriate documentation reasonably requested by Lessee, all at Lessee's own
cost and expense, to evidence Agent's release of Agent's security interest in
the Collateral.  At such time, Agent shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill
of sale (without representations or warranties except that the Equipment is
free and clear of Lessor Liens) for the Equipment.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such release shall not relieve Lessee of its continuing obligations
under Articles VII, VIII, and XI of the Participation Agreement or any other
provision of an Operative Agreement which survives the termination hereof.

         Section 13.2.    Retention of Title or Proceeds in the Case of
Default.  If Lessee would be entitled to any amount (including any Casualty
Proceeds or Partial Casualty Proceeds) or title to any item of Equipment
hereunder but for the existence of any Event of Default or event which with the
giving of notice and/or passage of time could become an Event of Default, Agent
shall, on behalf of the Lessors, hold such amount or item of Equipment as part
of the Collateral and shall be entitled to apply such amounts against any
amounts due hereunder, provided that Agent shall distribute such amount or
transfer such Equipment in accordance with the other terms of this Lease if and
when no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice and/or
passage of time could become an Event of Default exists.

construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring, nor

         of the conditions set forth in this Section 22.2, any Lessor may make
         any such assignment, conveyance or transfer to any Affiliate if such
         transferee's obligations under the Operative Agreements shall have
         been unconditionally guaranteed by such Lessor by an instrument in
         form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent; provided that
         the term of such Lessor's guarantee shall not be required to extend
         past March 31, 1995.

         through (i) below are satisfied with respect to such transfer.

                 (c)      Transfer with Consent.  Any transfer to an entity
         other than one satisfying the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)
         or (b) of this Section 22.2 may only be made with the prior written
         consent of the Lessee and the Required Lessors, which consent shall
         not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                 (d)      Required Notice and Effective Date.  Any Lessor
         desiring to effect a transfer of its interest hereunder shall give
         written notice of each such proposed transfer to the Lessee, the Agent
         and each other Lessor at least ten (10) days prior to such proposed
         transfer, setting forth the name of such proposed transferee, the
         percentage or interest to be retained by such Lessor, if any, and the
         date on which such transfer is proposed to become effective.  All
         reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Agent in connection
         with any such disposition by a Lessor under this Section 22.2 shall be
         borne by such Lessor.  In the event of a transfer under this Section
         22.2, any expenses incurred by the transferee in connection with its
         review of the Operative Agreements and its investigation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby shall be borne by such transferee or
         the relevant Lessor, as they may determine, but shall not be
         considered costs and expenses which the Lessee is obligated to pay or
         reimburse under Section 11.5 of the Participation Agreement.

                 (e)      Assumption of Obligations.  Any transferee pursuant
         to this Section 22.2 shall have executed and delivered to the Agent a
         letter in substantially the form of the Investors Letter attached
         hereto as Exhibit A, and thereupon the obligations of the transferring
         Lessor under the Operative Agreements shall be proportionately
         released and reduced to the extent of such transfer.  Upon any such
         transfer as above provided, the transferee shall be deemed to be bound
         by all obligations (whether or not yet accrued) under, and to have
         become a party to, all Operative Agreements to which its transferor
         was a party, shall be deemed the pertinent "Lessor" for all purposes
         of the Operative Agreements and shall be deemed to have made that
         portion of the payments pursuant to the Participation Agreement
         previously made or deemed to have been made by the transferor
         represented by the interest being conveyed; and each reference herein
         and in the other Operative Agreements to the pertinent "Lessor" shall
         thereafter be deemed a reference to the transferee, to the extent of
         such transfer,





                                            38
<PAGE>   129
         for all purposes.  Upon any such transfer, the Agent shall deliver to
         each Lessor and the Lessee a new Schedule I to the Participation
         Agreement, revised to reflect the relevant information for such new
         Lessor and the Commitment of such new Lessor (and the revised
         Commitment of the transferor Lessor if it shall not have transferred
         its entire interest).

                 (f)      Employee Benefit Plans.  No Lessor may make any such
         assignment, conveyance or transfer to or in connection with any
         arrangement or understanding in any way involving any employee benefit
         plan (or its related trust), as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
         with the assets of any such plan (or its related trust), as defined in
         Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (other than a governmental plan, as
         defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), with respect to which the Lessee
         or such Lessor or any of their Affiliates is a party in interest
         within the meaning of ERISA or a "disqualified person" within the
         meaning of the Code.

                 (g)      Limitation on Transfers.  Notwithstanding paragraphs
         (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 22.2, any Lessor proposing to
         transfer its interest may not make any such assignment, conveyance or
         transfer at any time when there shall have occurred and be continuing
         any material default of such Lessor to the Lessee under the
         Participation Agreement.

                 (h)      Amount of Commitment.  No Lessor may make any such
         assignment, conveyance or transfer if, as a consequence thereof, the
         transferor (if such Lessor retains any part of its Commitment) or
         transferee Lessor would have a Commitment (assuming for this purpose
         no funding by such Lessor) of less than U.S. $2,000,000.

                 (i)      Representations and Warranties.  Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary set forth above, no Lessor may assign, convey
         or transfer its interest to any Person, unless such Person shall have
         delivered to the Agent and the Lessee a certificate confirming the
         accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
         5.2 of the Participation Agreement with respect to such Person (other
         than as such representation or warranty relates to the execution and
         delivery of Operative Agreements).

such amounts due to Lessors on such distribution, then such amount shall be
distributed ratably, without priority of one such Person over the other, in the
proportion that the amount which would have been distributed to each such
Person pursuant to this provision, but for such insufficiency, bears to the

has an obligation to effect such registration or otherwise assist in the
disposition of the Interest.

<PAGE>   145
                                FORM OF SUBLEASE

         SUBLEASE, dated as of April 29, 1994 between Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Sublessor"), and Tone Brothers, Inc., an Iowa
corporation ("Sublessee").

                                    RECITALS

         (A)     Sublessor is Lessee under that certain Lease Intended as
Security, dated as of April 29, 1994 (as from time to time thereafter amended
or supplemented, the "Lease") with the Lessors listed on the signature pages
thereto and BA Leasing & Capital Corporation, not individually, but solely as
agent for the benefit of the Lessors ("Agent").  Unless otherwise defined
herein or the context hereof otherwise requires, terms which are defined or
defined by reference in the Lease shall have the same meanings when used herein
as such terms have therein, whether or not the Lease is then in effect.

         (B)     Sublessor desires to lease to Sublessee, and Sublessee desires
to lease from Sublessor, the items of equipment described on Schedule I hereto,
as from time to time hereafter amended ("Sublease Items").

         Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         SECTION 1.  LEASE.  Sublessor leases to Sublessee and Sublessee leases
from Sublessor the Sublease Items described onSchedule I hereto, as such
description may from time to time be hereafter amended with the consent of
Assignee (as hereinafter defined).

         SECTION 2.  TERM.  The term of this Sublease shall be concurrent with
the term of the Lease and termination of the Lease (including, without
limitation, termination pursuant to Article X thereof) shall constitute
automatic termination of this Sublease.  Termination of the Lease with respect
to any but not all of the Sublease Items shall constitute automatic termination
of this Sublease only with respect to the Sublease Items no longer subject to
the Lease.

         If Sublessor elects to exercise the Lessee Purchase Option as provided
in Section 11.1(b) of the Lease, Sublessor shall sell to Sublessee, and
Sublessee shall purchase from Sublessor, the Sublease Items subject thereto for
(i) the portion of the Purchase Option Exercise Amount, any applicable
Make-Whole Premiums and any other amounts then due and payable attributable to
such Sublease Items or, (ii) if less than all of the Equipment is subject to
such Lessee Purchase Option, the aggregate of the amounts that are required to
be paid by Sublessor to Agent under Section 11.1(b)(A) of the Lease
attributable to such Sublease
<PAGE>   146
Items.  Such payment for such Sublease Items shall be made by Sublessee
concurrently upon Sublessor's payment to the Agent pursuant to Section
11.1(b)(A) of the Lease.  Upon payment by the Sublessee for Sublease Items,
Sublessor shall execute and deliver to Sublessee a quitclaim bill of sale
(without representations or warranties) for such Sublease Items.

         If Sublessor elects to exercise the Sale Option as provided in Section
11.1(c) of the Lease, Sublessee shall on the last day of the Lease Term permit
a purchaser of any Sublease Item to take possession thereof.  Sublessee shall
pay to Sublessor an amount equal to the amount payable by Sublessor pursuant to
Section 11.1(c)(2)(ii) of the Lease attributable to the Sublease Items.  Such
payment for the Sublease Items shall be made by Sublessee on the date that the
Section 11.1(c)(2)(ii) amount is payable by Sublessor to Lessor under the
Lease.  If such purchaser cannot take possession of a Sublease Item on the last
day of the Lease Term, the Sublessee shall store such Sublease Item for a
reasonable period of time, but shall at all times comply with the last sentence
of Section 11.3 of the Lease.

         SECTION 3.  RENT.  The rent and rental payment dates shall be as
agreed from time to time by Sublessor and Sublessee; provided, however, that if
Assignee is exercising its rights with respect to this Sublease or any Sublease
Items, rent shall be payable quarterly on the Sublease Items on each April 30,
July 30, October 30 and January 30 and shall be in an amount, with respect to
each Sublease Item, equal to that portion of the rental under the Lease and
applicable Lease Supplement attributable to such Sublease Item.

         SECTION 4.  WARRANTIES.  NEITHER SUBLESSOR NOR ANY ASSIGNEE MAKES ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY WHATSOEVER OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
ANY PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE REGARDING ANY SUBLEASE ITEM OR ANY PART THEREOF.

         SECTION 5.  LEASE.  This Sublease is in all respects subject and
subordinate to the Lease (and each Lease Supplement governing any Sublease
Item) and the Liens created thereby.  Without limiting the foregoing, if for
any reason Assignee shall exercise rights or remedies thereunder, such exercise
may include the termination hereof, notwithstanding, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, any right of Sublessee hereunder.  Sublessee shall in all
respects comply with all of the terms and provisions of Article V of the Lease.

         SECTION 6.  ASSIGNMENT; SUBLEASE.  Sublessor shall have the right to
assign, and has assigned to Agent concurrently with entering into this
Sublease, all or any part of its right, title and interest in and to this
Sublease and shall have the right to grant and has granted to Agent for the
benefit of the Lessors a





                                      B-2
<PAGE>   147
security interest in the Sublease Items to the Agent (in this capacity,
"Assignee", which term shall also be deemed to refer to any successor or assign
of Agent in such capacity) pursuant to the Lease.  Such assignment and grant
shall (i) be superior to Sublessee's rights hereunder; (ii) not relieve
Sublessor of any of its obligations hereunder; and (iii) not be construed to be
an assumption by Assignee of any obligations of Sublessor hereunder.  Upon
written request of Assignee, Sublessee shall make all payments of rent directly
to Assignee, at such address as Assignee shall specify.  Sublessee shall, upon
request, execute and deliver such instruments and take such other action as may
reasonably be requested to protect Sublessor's or Assignee's interests.  This
Sublease shall not be amended, modified or waived without the consent of
Assignee.  Sublessee acknowledges that this Sublease has been assigned, and a
security interest in the Sublease Items has been granted, to Agent under the
Lease.  Sublessee shall not assign any right or interest in this Sublease.

         Except as expressly provided in this Section 6, any further

                           LEASE INTENDED AS SECURITY


         This LEASE INTENDED AS SECURITY (as amended, modified, restated or
supplemented from time to time, this Lease") dated as of April 29, 1994 (the
"Effective Date") is between Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Lessee"), with its principal office at 761 Terminal Street, Los Angeles, CA
90021, BA Leasing & Capital Corporation, Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation and
Manufacturers Bank (collectively, the "Lessors" and each a "Lessor"), and BA
Leasing & Capital Corporation, a California corporation, not in its individual
capacity, but solely in its capacity as agent under this Lease ("Agent") for
the benefit of the Lessors.

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in
that certain Participation Agreement dated as of April 29, 1994 (the
"Participation Agreement"), among Lessee, Sublessee, the Lessors and Agent,
Lessors have agreed to purchase and thereafter lease the Equipment to Lessee
pursuant to this Lease.

         AND WHEREAS, the Participation Agreement contemplates that, following
Lessee's execution and delivery of this Lease, Lessee will sublease a portion
of the Equipment to Sublessee pursuant to the terms of the Sublease;

         AND WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
(including those used in the foregoing recitals) shall have the meanings
specified in Schedule X to the Participation Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires.

         AND WHEREAS, to secure Lessee's obligations under this Lease and the
other Operative Agreements, Lessee will grant to the Agent, for the benefit of
the Lessors, a security interest in the Collateral, including, without
limitation, the Equipment and the Sublease.

         NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                   Article I

                            DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

         Section 1.1.     Acceptance and Lease of Equipment.  Subject to each
Participant's satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of the conditions set
forth in Articles II and III of the Participation Agreement, on each Delivery
Date and upon execution
<PAGE>   6
and delivery of a Lease Supplement covering all of the Equipment to be
purchased on such date, Lessors shall lease to the Lessee, and Lessee will
lease from the Lessors, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Lease and such Lease Supplement, the Equipment purchased by the Agent on behalf
of the Lessors on such Delivery Date.

         Section 1.2.     Acceptance Procedure.  Lessors hereby authorize one
or more employees of Lessee to be designated by Lessee as the authorized
representative or representatives of Lessors to accept delivery of the
Equipment on each Delivery Date.  Lessee hereby agrees that such acceptance of
delivery by such authorized representative or representatives and the execution
and delivery by Lessee on each Delivery Date of a Lease Supplement shall,
without further act, constitute the irrevocable acceptance by Lessee of the
Equipment which is the subject thereof for all purposes of this Lease and the
other Operative Agreements on the terms set forth therein and herein.


                                   Article II

                                   LEASE TERM

         Section 2.1.     Initial Term.  The commencement of the term of this
Lease shall be on the Effective Date and shall continue until, but not
including, April 29, 1995 (the "Initial Term"), unless earlier terminated in
accordance with the provisions herein or extended pursuant to Section 2.2 and
Article XI.

         Section 2.2.     Lease Renewal.  Lessee may elect to renew this Lease
for up to five successive one-year renewal terms (each, a "Renewal Term") as
provided in Article XI.


                                  Article III

                        RENT; OTHER ECONOMIC PROVISIONS

         Section 3.1.     Rent Payments.  On each Payment Date during the
Initial Term and each Renewal Term, Lessee shall pay to Agent for the benefit
of the Lessors the Interim Rent, Basic Rent or Renewal Rent, as applicable,
that has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of each Lease Supplement
entered into prior to such Payment Date.  Scheduled installments of Basic Rent
and Renewal Rent may be adjusted pursuant to Section 6.1.

         Section 3.2.     Place and Manner of Payment.  (a) Rent and all other
sums due Lessors hereunder shall be paid in immediately available funds to
Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, at the Agent's Corporate Office, or at
such other office of Agent as it





                                       2
<PAGE>   7
may from time to time specify to Lessee in a notice pursuant to this Lease.
All such payments shall be received by Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. San
Francisco time, on the date due; funds received after such time shall for all
purposes under the Operative Agreements be deemed to have been received by
Lessor on the next succeeding Business Day.  Lessee shall pay to Agent for the
benefit of the Lessors, on demand, interest (i) with respect to any overdue
amount of Rent or Make-Whole Premium, at the rate per annum which is 2% above
the Interest Rate under the Lease Supplement relating to the Functional Unit in
respect of which such amount is due and (ii) with respect to any other payment
under this Lease that is not paid when due (without taking into account any
applicable grace period), at the rate which is 2% per annum above the Interest
Rate set forth in Schedule II to the Lease Supplement delivered on the Initial
Delivery Date, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) interest from
the date due (not taking into account any grace period) until payment is made.

         (b) Agent shall make all payments to Lessors required under this Lease
or the Participation Agreement on the date the Agent receives the applicable
payment from Lessee, so long as Agent has received such payment from Lessee not
later than 9:00 a.m. San Francisco time, and if Agent receives the applicable
payment from Lessee later than 9:00 a.m. San Francisco time, then Agent shall
make payment to the Lessors on the next succeeding Business Day.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such amounts may be held by the Agent
pending the Agent's reasonable, good faith determination of the Lessor or
Lessors entitled to such payment (and the portion thereof payable to each
Lessor), and shall be paid by the Agent to each Lessor entitled thereto
promptly upon making such determination by transferring such amounts to such
Lessors; provided, however, that if such determination is not made by the end
of the second Business Day following receipt by the Agent of the applicable
payment and the amount of such payment shall exceed, in the aggregate,
$100,000, the Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lessors, invest such
funds in Permitted Investments.

         Section 3.3.     Net Lease.  This Lease is a net lease and Lessee's
obligation to pay all Rent, indemnity and other amounts payable hereunder shall
be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lessee shall not be entitled to any
abatement or reduction of Rent or any setoff against Rent, indemnity or other
amount, whether arising by reason of any past, present or future claims of any
nature by Lessee against Agent or any Lessor, or otherwise.  Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, this Lease shall not terminate, nor shall
the obligations of Lessee be otherwise affected (a) by reason of any defect in,
damage to, or loss of possession or use, obsolescence or destruction, of any or





                                       3
<PAGE>   8
all of the Equipment, however caused; or (b) by the taking or requisitioning of
any or all of the Equipment by condemnation or otherwise; or (c) by the
invalidity or unenforceability or lack of due authorization by Agent, Lessors
or Lessee or other infirmity of this Lease; or (d) by lack of power or
authority of Lessor to enter into this Lease; or (e) by the attachment of any
Lien of any third party to any item of Equipment; or (f) by any prohibition or
restriction of or interference with Lessee's use of any or all of the Equipment
by any Person; or (g) by the insolvency of or the commencement by or against
Lessee, Agent or any Lessor of any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding; or (h) by any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing, any present or future law to the contrary notwithstanding.  It is
the intention of the parties that all Rent, indemnities and other amounts
payable by Lessee hereunder shall be payable in all events in the manner and at
the times herein provided unless Lessee's obligations in respect thereof have
been terminated or modified pursuant to the express provisions of this Lease.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lessee waives any and all rights
which it may now have or which may at any time be conferred upon it, by statute
or otherwise, to terminate, cancel, quit or surrender this Lease, in whole or
in part, except strictly in accordance with the express terms hereof.  Each
rental, indemnity or other payment made by Lessee hereunder shall be final, and
Lessee shall not seek to recover (except as expressly provided in this Lease)
all or any part of such payment from Lessors or the Agent for any reason
whatsoever.


                                   Article IV

                                   WARRANTIES

THAT:  (a) THE EQUIPMENT IS OF A SIZE, DESIGN, CAPACITY AND MANUFACTURE
SELECTED BY LESSEE; (b) LESSEE IS SATISFIED THAT THE SAME IS SUITABLE FOR ITS
PURPOSES; (c) NEITHER AGENT NOR ANY LESSOR IS A MANUFACTURER THEREOF OR A
DEALER IN PROPERTY OF SUCH KIND; AND (d) NEITHER AGENT NOR ANY LESSOR HAS MADE
OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE: (i) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR COVENANT
WITH RESPECT TO THE TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
CONDITION, QUALITY, DESCRIPTION, DURABILITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ITEM OF
EQUIPMENT IN ANY RESPECT OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR FOR THE PURPOSES AND USES OF
LESSEE; OR (ii) ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT, EXCEPT THAT EACH OF THE LESSORS
REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS, SEVERALLY AND NOT JOINTLY, THAT ON EACH DELIVERY DATE
IT SHALL HAVE RECEIVED AN UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN WHATEVER TITLE WAS CONVEYED BY
THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE EQUIPMENT DELIVERED ON SUCH DELIVERY DATE BY





                                       4
<PAGE>   9
SUCH MANUFACTURERS, FREE OF LESSOR LIENS CREATED BY SUCH LESSOR EXCEPT FOR
PERMITTED LESSOR LIENS AND LIENS CREATED PURSUANT TO THE OPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.

         Section 4.2.     Assignment of Warranties.  Lessors assign to Lessee,
to the extent assignable, all of their interest, if any, in any warranties,
covenants and representations of any manufacturer, producer, vendor or maker of
any item of Equipment, provided that such assignment shall remain in effect
only so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
provided, further, that any action taken by Lessee by reason thereof shall be
at the expense of Lessee and shall be consistent with Lessee's obligations
pursuant to this Lease.


                                   Article V

                        POSSESSION, ASSIGNMENT, USE AND
                            MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT

         Section 5.1.     Restriction on Lessee's Possession and Use.  Lessee
shall not (a) use, operate, maintain or store any Functional Unit, item of
Equipment or any portion thereof (i) except in accordance with Section 5.3; or
(ii) in violation of any applicable insurance policy or law or regulation of
any Authority; (b) abandon any item of Equipment; (c) except as permitted by
Section 5.2 and Section 6.1 of the Participation Agreement, sublease or assign,
without the prior written consent of Lessor, any item of Equipment or permit
the use thereof by anyone other than Lessee; (d) except as set forth in Section
5.2 and Section 6.1 of the Participation Agreement, sell, assign or transfer
any of its rights hereunder or in any item of Equipment, or directly or
indirectly create, incur or suffer to exist any Lien on any of its rights
hereunder or in any item of Equipment, except for Permitted Liens; or (e)
except in connection with any maintenance or repair thereof, permit any item of
Equipment or any Part relating to such item of Equipment to be located at any
location other than the location of such Equipment or Part as of the Delivery
Date applicable thereto and as set forth opposite such item of Equipment on
Schedule I of the applicable Lease Supplement.  Lessee will defend the sale of
the Equipment by Lessee and Manufacturers to Agent, for the benefit of the
Lessors, against the claims or demands of all Persons.

         Section 5.2.     Sublease.  Subject to Sections 6.1(a) and 6.2(a) of
the Participation Agreement, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Lessee may sublease one or more Functional Units to a Subsidiary of
Lessee without the prior written consent of Lessors or Agent; provided that (i)
any such sublease shall automatically expire upon the expiration of the Lease
Term or any earlier termination of this Lease and shall





                                       5
<PAGE>   10
be expressly subject and subordinate to this Lease and the Liens created
hereby, (ii) the sublease agreement shall be in writing and shall expressly
prohibit any further assignment, sublease or transfer and (iii) all of Lessee's
rights, title and interest in, to and under the sublease shall be pledged by
Lessee to Lessors, as collateral for Lessee's obligations under the Operative
Agreements, by delivery of an executed copy upon the execution and delivery
thereof, marked as the sole original execution copy for Uniform Commercial Code
purposes, to the Agent, and Lessee shall, at its own cost and expense, do any
further act and execute, acknowledge, deliver, file, register and record any
further documents which the Agent or Lessors may reasonably request in order to
create, perfect, preserve and protect Agent's and Lessors' security interest in
the sublease.  Lessee shall remain primarily liable hereunder for the
performance of all of the terms of this Lease to the same extent as if such
sublease had not been entered into.

         Section 5.3.     Maintenance.  Lessee shall at its own cost and
expense and at all times during the term of this Lease (a) maintain, manage and
monitor the Equipment in compliance with all applicable requirements of any
law, Authority and/or insurance policies; (b) maintain the Equipment (or cause
the Equipment to be maintained) in as good operating order, repair, condition
and appearance as it was on the date such Equipment became subject to this
Lease (assuming that, as of such date, the Equipment was in good operating
order, repair, condition and appearance), ordinary wear and tear excepted; (c)
maintain, manage and monitor the Equipment in accordance with the terms of all
applicable contracts (including, without limitation, service contracts and
insurance contracts); (d) conduct all scheduled maintenance of the Equipment in
conformity with Lessee's past practices, and manufacturer's maintenance and
repair guidelines, for similar equipment (including, without limitation,
Lessee's maintenance program for such equipment); and (e) cause the Equipment
to continue to have at all times the capacity and functional ability to
perform, on a continuing basis (subject to normal interruption in the ordinary
course of business for maintenance, inspection, service, repair and testing)
and in commercial operation, the functions for which it was specifically
designed.  Lessee shall in any event maintain the Equipment (or cause the
Equipment to be maintained) in at least as good a condition as comparable
equipment owned or leased by it or any of its Subsidiaries.  Lessee will
maintain or cause to be maintained and shall permit the Agent and Lessors to
inspect any records, logs and other materials required by any governmental
authority having jurisdiction to be maintained or filed in respect of any items
of Equipment.

         Section 5.4.     Replacement and Substitution.

                 (a)      In the event that any Part which may from time to
         time be incorporated or installed in or attached to any item of
         Equipment, or any item of Equipment itself, becomes at any time worn
         out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond
         repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever
         (unless such event constitutes a Casualty or Partial Casualty, in
         which event the provisions of Section 6.1 or 6.2 hereof shall apply),
         Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace, or cause
         to be replaced, such Part or item of Equipment (the Substituted Item")
         with a replacement Part or item of Equipment (a "Replacement Part").
         In addition, Lessee may, at its own cost and expense, remove in the
         ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing,
         any Part, whether or not worn out, destroyed, seized, confiscated,
         damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use, provided
         that Lessee will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Part as
         promptly as is commercially reasonable.  All Replacement Parts shall
         be free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and shall
         be in as good an operating condition as, and shall have a value and
         utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced
         Parts and the Equipment were immediately prior to such replacement or
         the event or events necessitating such replacement in the condition
         and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof.  Any Part at
         any time removed from any item of Equipment shall remain subject to
         the interests of the Agent and the Lessors under the Operative
         Agreements, no matter where located, until such time as such Part
         shall be replaced by a Part which has been incorporated or installed
         in or attached to such item of Equipment and which meets the
         requirements for a Replacement Part specified above.  Immediately upon
         any Replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or attached
         to any such item of Equipment as above provided, without further act
         (i) title to the replaced Part shall thereupon vest in Lessee, free
         and clear of all rights of the Lessors, and shall no longer be deemed
         a Part hereunder, (ii) title to such Replacement Part shall thereupon
         vest in the Lessors and (iii) such Replacement Part shall become
         subject to this Lease and the security interest created hereunder and
         be deemed part of such item of Equipment for all purposes hereof to
         the same extent as the Parts incorporated or installed in or attached
         to such item of Equipment on the date such item of Equipment became
         subject to this Lease.  No later than 45 days after the end of each
         fiscal quarter of Lessee, Lessee shall deliver to Lessors a Bill of
         Sale evidencing the conveyance by Lessee to the Lessors of all
         Replacement Parts not previously evidenced by





                                       7
<PAGE>   12
         a Bill of Sale and such other documents in respect of such Part or 
         Parts as the Required Lessors may reasonably request in order to 
         confirm that title to such Part or Parts has passed to Lessors, as
         provided above.  Each such Bill of Sale shall provide that each 
         Lessor is granted an undivided interest in such Replacement Parts 
         equal to its Lease Percentage as of the date of such transfer.

                 (b) In addition to the foregoing, Lessee shall have the option
         at any time to replace any Functional Unit (a "Replaced Unit") with a
         substitute Functional Unit (a "Replacement Unit"), subject to the
         following conditions:

                          (i) any such Replacement Unit shall satisfy one of
                 the following conditions:  (x) the Replacement Unit shall
                 consist of items of new equipment of identical manufacture and
                 model as the equipment comprising the Replaced Unit, or (y)
                 such Replacement Unit shall have a utility, an Appraised
                 Value, and an economic useful life at least equal to those of
                 the Replaced Unit immediately prior to such substitution,
                 assuming that the Replaced Unit was in the condition and
                 repair required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease,
                 and Lessee shall have provided to the Agent and each Lessor,
                 at Lessee's expense, an Appraisal satisfactory to Agent and
                 each Lessor in their sole and absolute discretion with respect
                 to the determination of such utility, Fair Market Value and
                 economic useful life or (z) such Replacement Unit shall
                 otherwise be acceptable to each of the Lessors in its
                 respective sole and absolute discretion;

                          (ii) Lessee shall have satisfied each of the
                 conditions set forth in Section 4.3 of the Participation
                 Agreement (other than subsection (b) thereof) with respect to
                 the proposed replacement; and

                          (iii) Lessee shall not remove the Replaced Unit from
                 the location set forth onSchedule I to the Delivery Date
                 Notice pursuant to which the Replaced Unit was delivered until
                 such time as it has executed all documents reasonably
                 requested by Agent or any Lessor to perfect the security
                 interest of the Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, in the
                 Replacement Unit.

         Any Replacement Unit substituted in accordance with this Section
         5.4(b) shall thereafter be considered a Functional Unit for all
         purposes of this Lease.

<PAGE>   13
                 (c)      Lessee may request the replacement of an item of
         Equipment (pursuant to the foregoing subsection (a)) or a Functional
         Unit (pursuant to the foregoing subsection (b) by delivery of a
         Replacement Notice in the manner described in Section 4.3 of the
         Participation Agreement.  Upon the satisfaction of the conditions
         specified in such Section 4.3, each in form and substance satisfactory
         to the Required Lessors, and the Replacement Part or Replacement Unit
         becoming subject to this Lease and the security interest created
         hereunder, Lessor shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill of sale
         (without representations or warranties, except that the Substituted
         Item or Replaced Unit, as the case may be, is free and clear of all
         Lessor Liens) and such other documents as may be required to release
         the Substituted Item or Replaced Unit, as the case may be, from the
         terms and scope of this Lease, in such form as may be reasonably
         requested by Lessee and are in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Lessors, all at Lessee's own cost and expense.

         Section 5.5.     Alterations, Modifications and Additions; Removable
Parts.

                 (a)      Except as provided in Section 5.4, Lessee shall not
         remove, replace, modify, improve or alter (collectively, "alter") any
         item of Equipment or affix or place any Part on any item of Equipment
         if such alteration or addition would materially impair the originally
         intended function or use or materially reduce the value of such item
         of Equipment or the Functional Unit to which such item of Equipment
         belongs, provided that Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will make,
         or cause to be made any alteration or addition to or in respect of any
         item of Equipment that may be necessary, from time to time, to comply
         in all material respects with any applicable law, governmental rule or
         regulation (including any Environmental Law) or any provision of any
         insurance policy required to be maintained under Section 7.1 (any
         Parts being used to comply with this provision shall be hereafter
         referred to as "Mandatory Parts"); provided, however, that Lessee
         shall be under no obligation to take such action so long as the
         application of the applicable law, rule, regulation or provision is
         being contested by Lessee pursuant to a Permitted Contest.  Lessee
         shall notify Agent and the Lessors in advance of any proposed
         alteration of or addition to any item of Equipment if the cost of such
         alteration or addition, in the aggregate, can reasonably be expected
         to exceed $250,000, or if such advance notice is not practicable,
         within 30 days after the completion of such alteration or addition.
         All Parts affixed to or installed as a part on any item of Equipment,
         excluding temporary





                                       9
<PAGE>   14
         replacements, shall thereupon become subject to the security interest
         under this Lease.

                 (b)  If no Event of Default shall exist, Lessee may remove, at
         its own cost and expense, any Part at any time during the term of this
         Lease (such Part, a "Removable Part") which (i) is in addition to, and
         not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part originally
         incorporated or installed in or attached to an item of Equipment on
         the date such item became subject to this Lease or any Part in
         replacement of or substitution for any such Part originally
         incorporated or installed or attached to such Equipment, (ii) is not a
         Mandatory Part and (iii) can be removed from any item of Equipment
         without causing damage to such item of Equipment or diminishing or
         impairing the value, utility or condition that such item of Equipment
         would have had at such time had such addition not occurred, provided
         that (x) such removal will not materially impair the value or use
         which the item of Equipment would have had at such time had such Part
         not been affixed to or placed on such Equipment, (y) such Part is not
         necessary for the continued normal use of such item of Equipment and
         (z) such removal would not cause the Functional Unit to which such
         items of Equipment belong to no longer constitute a Functional Unit.
         Lessee shall repair all damage to the item of Equipment resulting from
         any alteration so as to restore any item of Equipment to the condition
         in which it existed prior to such alteration (ordinary wear and tear
         excepted).  Lessors shall not have any obligation to pay for or to
         reimburse Lessee for any alteration permitted by this Section 5.5.

Title to all Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to any
item of Equipment as the result of alterations, modifications or additions
under this Section 5.5, except Removable Parts, shall, without further act,
vest in Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, in the manner provided in clause
(ii) of Section 5.4(a) and the other applicable provisions of Section 5.4 shall
apply with respect to such Parts.  Title to any Removable Part shall not vest
in Agent, and upon the removal by Lessee of any Removable Part as provided
herein, such Removable Part shall no longer be deemed part of the item of
Equipment from which it was removed.  Any Removable Part not removed by Lessee
as provided herein prior to the end of the Lease Term or applicable Renewal
Term shall become the property of Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, at
such time.

         Section 5.6.     Labeling of Equipment.  Lessee shall as soon as
practicable affix and keep throughout the Lease Term, including any Renewal
Terms, labels, plates or other markings, bearing the inscription "Security
Interest held by BA Leasing &





                                       10
<PAGE>   15
Capital Corporation, as agent for the Lessors" upon a prominent place on each
item of Equipment reasonably susceptible to being so labeled.

         Section 5.7.     Inspection of Collateral.  Agent, the Lessors and
each of their agents and representatives shall have the right at all reasonable
times, upon reasonable notice, to inspect any Collateral.


                                   Article VI

                           RISK OF LOSS; REPLACEMENT

         Section 6.1.     Casualty.  Upon a Casualty, Lessee shall give prompt
written notice thereof (a "Casualty Notice") to Agent and Lessors, which notice
shall specify whether Lessee will:

                 (a)      repay the Functional Unit Balance for each Functional
         Unit subject to such Casualty together with unpaid Accrued Supplement
         Rent on each such Functional Unit Balance so prepaid to the date of
         payment and the applicable Make-Whole Premium on each such Functional
         Unit Balance so repaid.  All such amounts shall be paid to Agent for
         the benefit of the Lessors no later than the next scheduled Payment
         Date occurring at least 30 days after such Casualty, but in no event
         later than the Termination Date (such date being referred to as the
         Casualty Settlement Date"); or

                 (b)      replace pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.4(b)
         hereof and Section 4.3 of the Participation Agreement each Functional
         Unit with respect to which the Casualty has occurred; provided,
         however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or an event
         which with the giving of notice and/or the passage of time could give
         rise to an Event of Default, Lessee shall be obligated, at the option
         of the Required Lessors, to make the payments referred to in clause (a)
         above and shall not be entitled to exercise any right or election of
         replacement as set forth in this clause (b).

         All proceeds of any casualty insurance or condemnation proceeds
("Casualty Proceeds") paid to the Lessee or any of its Affiliates by reason of
a Casualty to a Functional Unit shall be deposited into a deposit account
established by Agent for the benefit of the Lessors (the "Deposit Account").
Any Casualty Proceeds paid to Agent with respect to a Functional Unit suffering
a Casualty shall also be deposited in the Deposit Account.  Any monies in the
Deposit Account attributable to a Casualty shall be remitted promptly to Lessee
after either (i) Lessee's payment in full of the Functional Unit Balance





                                       11
<PAGE>   16
together with the applicable Make-Whole Premium or (ii) Lessee's full
compliance with the conditions governing a Replacement Part, as applicable
pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above.

         If Lessee has elected to pay the Functional Unit Balance and an amount
equal to the applicable Make-Whole Premium pursuant to clause (a) above, Lessee
shall continue to make all payments of Rent due hereunder in respect of the
Functional Unit or Units suffering a Casualty through the date the Functional
Unit Balance and the applicable Make-Whole Premium are paid.  Upon payment of
each of the amounts required by Section 6.1(a), then all scheduled installments
of Rent, including installments of Renewal Rent, thereafter payable for the
remainder of the Lease Term in respect of the Lease Supplement applicable to
the Functional Unit or Units suffering the Casualty, and the portion of the
Purchase Option Exercise Amounts allocable to such Lease Supplement, shall be
re-calculated by the Agent in the manner specified in Section 3.1 of the
Participation Agreement, without taking into account the Purchase Price or
Functional Unit Balance of the Functional Unit suffering the Casualty.

         Section 6.2.     Partial Casualty.  Upon any Partial Casualty with
respect to a Functional Unit, Lessee shall give to Agent and Lessors a Notice
of Partial Casualty.  As soon as practicable after a Partial Casualty, Lessee
shall (a) repair and rebuild the affected portions of such Functional Unit (or
cause such affected portions to be repaired and rebuilt) to the condition
required to be maintained by Section 5.3 hereof, provided that the value and
functional capability of such Functional Unit, as restored, is at least
equivalent to the value and functional capability of such Functional Unit as in
effect immediately prior to the occurrence of such Partial Casualty or (b)
replace such affected items of Equipment with Replacement Parts pursuant to the
provisions of Section 5.4(a).

         Section 6.3.     Partial Casualty Proceeds.  All Partial Casualty
Proceeds received by Lessee or any of its Affiliates as a result of a Partial
Casualty shall be promptly paid to Agent.  Agent shall deposit such Partial
Casualty Proceeds into the Deposit Account and, so long as no Event of Default
or event which with the giving of notice and/or passage of time could give rise
to an Event of Default shall exist, Agent shall disburse such Partial Casualty
Proceeds with respect to a Functional Unit (or an item of Equipment
constituting part of such Functional Unit) suffering a Partial Casualty as
follows:

                 (a)      to Lessee in reimbursement of the costs of repairing
         and rebuilding the affected portions of such Functional Unit (or item
         of Equipment constituting part of such Functional Unit) suffering a
         Partial Casualty which the





                                       12
<PAGE>   17
         Lessee has chosen to repair and rebuild in accordance with Section
         6.2; or

                 (b)      upon a Replacement Part being duly substituted for
         each item of Equipment having suffered a Partial Casualty, to Lessee
         to the extent Partial Casualty Proceeds with respect to the
         corresponding Substituted Item were deposited into the Deposit
         Account.

         Partial Casualty Proceeds held by Agent and to be distributed in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 6.3 shall be disbursed by Agent
from the Deposit Account to Lessee from time to time (but no more frequently
than once per calendar month) to reimburse Lessee for the costs of repairing
and rebuilding the affected Functional Units as required under Section 6.2(a),
subject to such reasonable disbursement conditions as Agent may impose,
including presentation of invoices and other supporting documentation
reflecting such costs and delivery of Lien waivers; provided, however, that
Agent shall have no obligation to disburse any Partial Casualty Proceeds out of
the Deposit Account at any time that Agent, at the direction of the Required
Lessors, shall reasonably determine (i) that such Partial Casualty Proceeds are
not sufficient to repair and rebuild the affected Functional Units as required
by Section 6.2(a) (unless additional funds which are, in the sole discretion of
the Required Lessors, sufficient to so repair and rebuild the affected
Functional Units have been deposited in the Deposit Account) or (ii) that
Lessee is not diligently performing its obligations under Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, and provided that
no Event of Default and no event which with the giving of notice and/or passage
of time could become an Event of Default shall exist, if the aggregate amount
of Partial Casualty Proceeds attributable to any Partial Casualty is $100,000
or less, Lessee may receive such Partial Casualty Proceeds directly, without
delivery to Agent, provided that such Partial Casualty Proceeds are applied in
accordance with the requirements of Section 6.2.  In the event that Agent
receives Partial Casualty Proceeds in an amount that is less than $100,000 and
provided that no Event of Default and no event which with the giving of notice
and/or passage of time could become an Event of Default shall exist, Agent
shall promptly remit such funds to Lessee.  Notwithstanding any Partial
Casualty, all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease (including its
obligation to make all payments of Rent as they become due) shall continue
unabated and in full force and effect as provided in this Lease.

                                  Article VII

                                   INSURANCE

         Section 7.1.     Required Coverages.  Lessee will keep the Equipment
insured by financially sound and reputable insurers against loss or damage,
with insurance of the kinds and in the amounts customarily maintained by
similar corporations engaged in similar operations in similar jurisdictions and
carry such other insurance as is usually carried by such corporations, provided
that in any event Lessee will maintain:

                 (a)      Casualty Insurance -- insurance against risks of
         direct physical loss or damage with respect to the Equipment
         (including, without limitation, earthquake insurance) with deductibles
         and in such minimum amounts as are consistent with industry standards;
         provided, however, that at no time shall the amount of coverage, on a
         replacement cost basis, be less than the sum of (x) the Lease Balance
         and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate portion of the interest
         component of Basic Rent or Renewal Rent to be accrued under all Lease
         Supplements for 90 days following the date of determination;

                 (b)      Public Liability Insurance -- combined single limit
         insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage
         in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 per occurrence with such
         deductibles as are carried by similarly situated companies involved in
         operating similar facilities and equipment; and

                 (c)      Other Insurance -- such other insurance, including
         comprehensive motor vehicle, worker's compensation and business
         interruption insurance, in each case as generally carried by owners of
         equipment similar to the Equipment and properties in the States of
         California, Iowa and Oregon, in such amounts and against such risks as
         are then customary for equipment and property similar in use.

Such insurance shall be written by reputable insurance companies that are
financially sound and solvent and otherwise reasonably appropriate considering
the amount and type of insurance being provided by such companies.  Any
insurance company selected by Lessee which is rated in Best's Insurance Guide
or any successor thereto (or if there be none, an organization having a similar
national reputation) shall have a general policyholder rating of "A" and a
financial rating of at least "10" or be otherwise acceptable to the Required
Lessors.  Property/Casualty insurance maintained by Lessee shall name Agent,
for the benefit of the Lessors, as sole loss payee to the extent such claims
relate to items of Equipment subject to this Lease, and liability insurance





                                       14
<PAGE>   19
maintained by Lessee shall name Agent, together with the Lessors, as additional
insureds.  Each policy referred to in this Section 7.1 shall provide that (i)
it will not be cancelled or its limits reduced, or allowed to lapse without
renewal, except after not less than 30 days' written notice to Agent and the
Lessors, (ii) the interests of Agent and the Lessors shall not be invalidated
by any act or negligence of Lessee or any person having an interest in any item
of Equipment, (iii) such insurance is primary with respect to any other
insurance carried by or available to Agent and the Lessors, (iv) the insurer
shall waive any right of subrogation, setoff, counterclaim, or other deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise, against Agent and the Lessors and (v) such
policy shall contain a cross-liability clause providing for coverage of Agent
and each Lessor as if separate policies had been issued to each of them.
Lessee will notify Agent and Lessors promptly of any policy cancellation,
reduction in policy limits, modification or amendment.

         Section 7.2.     Delivery of Insurance Certificates.  On or before the
Initial Delivery Date and thereafter on each Subsequent Delivery Date, Lessee
shall deliver to Agent (with a copy to each Lessor) certificates of insurance
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessors evidencing the existence of all
insurance required to be maintained hereunder and setting forth the respective
coverages, limits of liability, carrier, policy number and period of coverage.
Thereafter, throughout the Lease Term, no sooner than 10 days before and no
later than on the last day of April (commencing in 1995), Lessee shall deliver
to Agent (with a copy to each Lessor) certificates of insurance evidencing that
all insurance required by Section 7.1 hereof to be maintained by Lessee with
respect to the Equipment subject to this Lease is in effect.  With each such
certificate of insurance (other than certificates delivered in connection with
Delivery Date Closings) Lessee shall cause to be delivered a written report of
a firm of independent insurance brokers of nationally recognized standing,
stating that, in their opinion, such policy is in compliance with the
provisions of Section 7.1 hereof and is comparable in all material respects
with insurance carried by responsible owners and operators of equipment similar

         Lessee may be due and owing under any Operative Agreement.

         Section 8.2.     Remedies.  If any Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Agent, on behalf of the Lessors as provided for in Article XII,
may exercise in any order one or





                                       18
<PAGE>   23
more or all of the remedies set forth in this Section 8.2 (it being understood
that no remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy
or remedies, but each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given herein or now or hereafter existing at law
or in equity or by statute, including without limitation any applicable Uniform
Commercial Code).

                 (a)      Agent may proceed by appropriate court action or
         actions, either at law or in equity, to enforce performance by Lessee
         of the applicable covenants of this Lease or to recover damages for
         the breach thereof.

                 (b)      Agent (with the consent of the Required Lessors) may
         by notice in writing to Lessee terminate this Lease, but Lessee shall
         remain liable as hereinafter provided; and Agent may do any one or
         more of the following, as instructed by the Required Lessors: (i)
         declare the Lease Balance, all unpaid Accrued Rent, all other amounts
         then due and payable by Lessee under this Lease and the other
         Operative Agreements and an amount equal to the Aggregate Make-Whole
         Premium to be immediately due and payable, and recover any other
         damages and expenses (including the costs and expenses described in
         Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 11.5 of the Participation Agreement) in addition
         thereto which Lessor shall have sustained by reason of such Event of
         Default, (ii) enforce the security interest given hereunder pursuant
         to the Uniform Commercial Code or any other law, (iii) enter upon the
         premises where any item of Equipment may be and either remove such
         Equipment (or any portion thereof), with any damage to the
         improvements upon which the Equipment may be attached to be borne by
         Lessee, or take possession of the Equipment and (iv) require Lessee to
         disassemble and return the Equipment as provided in Article IX hereof.

                 (c)      Agent may require Lessee immediately to purchase the
         Equipment for a purchase price equal to the sum of the Lease Balance,
         all unpaid Accrued Rent, an amount equal to the Aggregate Make-Whole
         Premium and all other amounts then due and payable under the Operative
         Agreements.

                 (d)      If an Event of Default set forth in Section 8.1(a) (a
         "Payment Default") shall have occurred, any Lessor may declare the
         Lease Balance immediately due and payable by giving written notice to
         Agent, Lessee and each other Lessor, whereupon the unpaid Lease
         Balance together with the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, and
         all unpaid Accrued Rent shall become immediately due and payable
         without further act or notice of any kind.  If an Event of Default set
         forth in Sections 8.1(f) or 8.1(g) (an "Insolvency Defaul") shall have
         occurred, the unpaid Lease Balance





                                       19
<PAGE>   24
         together with the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, and all unpaid
         Accrued Rent shall become immediately due and payable without further
         act or notice of any kind.  If an Event of Default other than an
         Insolvency Default or a Payment Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing, the Agent, with the consent of the Required Lessors, may
         declare the Lease (and each Lease Supplement) to be terminated and all
         payments thereunder to be due and payable immediately by giving
         written notice to Agent, Lessee and each Lessor, whereupon the unpaid
         Lease Balance together with the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any,
         and all unpaid Accrued Rent shall become immediately due and payable
         without further act or notice of any kind.  Nothing contained in this
         Section 8.2 shall limit the application of Article XXVIII in
         accordance with its terms.

Except for notices expressly otherwise provided for in the Operative
Agreements, Lessee hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any
kind including, without limitation, notices of default, notice of acceleration
and notice of intent to accelerate.

         Section 8.3.     Additional Remedies.  In addition to the remedies set
forth in Section 8.2, if any Event of Default shall occur, Agent shall, if
instructed by the Required Lessors, sell the Collateral in one or more sales;
provided, Lessors shall have no liability to Lessee if they fail to instruct
Agent to conduct such a sale.  Any Lessor or Agent may purchase all or any part
of the Collateral at such sale.  Lessee acknowledges that sales for cash or on
credit to a wholesaler, retailer or user of such Collateral, at a public or
private auction, are all commercially reasonable.  Any notice required by law
of intended disposition by Agent shall be deemed reasonable and properly given
if given at least 10 days before such disposition.

         Section 8.4.     Proceeds of Sale; Deficiency.  All payments received
and amounts held or realized by Agent at any time when an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, as well as all payments or amounts then
held or thereafter received by Agent, shall be distributed forthwith upon
receipt by Agent in the following order of priority:

                 first:  so much of such payments or amounts as shall be
         required to pay the reasonable fees and compensation of Agent in
         connection with acting as Agent not previously paid by Lessee shall be
         distributed to Agent;

                 second:  so much of such payments or amounts as shall be
         required to reimburse first Agent and then any Lessor for any tax
         (except as excluded pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Participation
         Agreement), expense or other amount owed to





                                       20
<PAGE>   25
         Agent (in its capacity as Agent) or any Lessor in connection with the
         collection or distribution of such payments or amounts to the extent
         not previously reimbursed by Lessee (including, without limitation,
         the expenses of any sale, taking or other proceeding, expenses in
         connection with realizing on any of the Collateral, reasonable
         attorneys' fees and expenses (including the allocated costs of
         internal counsel), court costs and any other reasonable expenditures
         incurred or reasonable expenditures or advances made by Agent (in its
         capacity as Agent) or any Lessor in the protection, exercise or
         enforcement of any right, power or remedy upon such Event of Default
         whether pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise) shall be so applied by
         Agent first to itself and then to Lessors; and in case the aggregate
         amount so to be paid to the Lessors in accordance herewith shall be
         insufficient to pay all such amounts as aforesaid, then ratably,
         without priority of one such Person over the other, in the proportion
         that the amount which would have been distributed to each such Person
         pursuant to this provision but for such insufficiency bears to the
         aggregate amount which would have been distributed to all Persons
         except for such insufficiency;

                 third:  (i)  so much of such payments or amounts remaining as
         shall be required to reimburse the then existing or prior Lessors for
         payments or deposits pursuant to Article XII (to the extent not
         previously reimbursed and to the extent not constituting an indemnity
         paid or payable for an act constituting gross negligence or willful
         misconduct) shall be distributed to the then existing or prior
         Lessors, ratably, without priority of one over the other, in
         accordance with the amount of the payments or deposits made by each
         such then existing or prior Lessor pursuant to such Article XII; and
         (ii) so much of such payments or amounts remaining as shall be
         required to pay the then existing or prior Lessors the amounts payable
         to them pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.5 hereof or Section
         11.5 of the Participation Agreement and the amounts of all other
         unpaid obligations then due and payable to them hereunder and under
         the Participation Agreement (other than obligations covered by clause
         fourth of this Section 8.4) shall be distributed to each Lessor
         (including its predecessor holders thereof) entitled thereto; and in
         case the aggregate amount so to be paid in accordance with clauses (i)
         and (ii) above shall be insufficient to pay all such amounts as
         aforesaid, then, ratably, without priority of one such Person over the
         other, in the proportion that the amount which would have been
         distributed to each such Person pursuant to thisclause third but for
         such insufficiency bears to the aggregate amount which would have





                                       21
<PAGE>   26
         been distributed to all such Persons pursuant to this clause third but
         for such insufficiency;

                 fourth:  so much of such payments or amounts remaining as
         shall be required to pay in full each Lessor's Lease Percentage of the
         aggregate unpaid Lease Balance, the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if
         any, and all accrued but unpaid Accrued Rent (including, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law, interest on interest) shall be
         distributed to the Lessors, and in case the aggregate amount to be so
         distributed shall be insufficient to pay the unpaid Lease Balance, the
         Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, and all accrued but unpaid
         Accrued Rent in full all as aforesaid, then, ratably, without priority
         of one over the other, in the proportions that each Lessor's Lease
         Percentage of aggregate unpaid Lease Balance, the Aggregate Make-Whole
         Premium, if any, then due and payable and all accrued but unpaid
         Accrued Rent to the date of distribution bears to the aggregate unpaid
         Lease Balance, the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, if any, due and
         payable and all accrued but unpaid Accrued Rent to the date of
         distribution under the Lease; and

                 fifth:  so much of such payments or amounts as shall remain
         shall be distributed to Lessee.

         Section 8.5.     Right to Perform Lessee's Agreements.  If Lessee
fails to perform any of its agreements contained herein or in any other
Operative Agreement, whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Agent, upon written instructions from the Required Lessors and
receipt by Agent of indemnification satisfactory to it, may perform such
agreement and the fees and expenses incurred by Agent (or one or more Lessors)
in connection with such performance together with interest thereon shall be
payable by Lessee upon demand.  Interest on fees and expenses so incurred by
Agent or one or more Lessors shall accrue at the rate provided in Section 3.2
for overdue payments.


                                   Article IX

                              RETURN OF EQUIPMENT

         If Agent, upon the instruction of the Required Lessors, shall
rightfully demand possession of the Equipment pursuant to this Lease, Lessee,
at its expense, shall forthwith disassemble, package to facilitate reassembly
and deliver exclusive possession of such Equipment to Agent at a location
designated by Agent, together with a copy of an inventory list of the Equipment
then subject to the Lease, all then current plans, specifications and





                                       22
<PAGE>   27
operating, maintenance and repair manuals relating to the Equipment that have
been received or prepared by Lessee, appropriately protected and in the
condition required by Section 5.3 hereof, to Agent.  In addition, if this Lease
has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.2, Lessee shall maintain the
Equipment in the condition required by Section 5.3, store the Equipment without
cost to the Agent or any Lessor and keep all of the Equipment insured in
accordance with Article VII for 90 days after redelivery thereof.


                                   Article X

                               EARLY TERMINATION

         If no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice and/or
passage of time could become an Event of Default shall exist, on any Payment
Date after the first Renewal Term, Lessee may, at its option, by giving at
least 30 days advance written notice to Agent and the Lessors, purchase all,
but not less than all, of the Equipment for the sum of (i) all unpaid Accrued
Rent due and payable on or prior to such Payment Date, (ii) the Lease Balance
(after taking into account all payments actually made pursuant to clause (i)),
(iii) an amount equal to the Aggregate Make-Whole Premium, and (iv) all other
fees and expenses then due and payable pursuant to this Lease and the other
Operative Agreements.  Upon the payment of such sums by Lessee in accordance
with the provisions of the preceding sentence, the obligation of Lessee to pay
Rent hereunder shall cease, the term of this Lease shall end on the date of
such payment and Agent shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill of sale
(without representations or warranties, except that the Equipment is free and
clear of Lessor Liens) and such other documents as may be required to release
the Equipment from the terms and scope of this Lease, in such form as may be
reasonably requested by Lessee, all at Lessee's own cost and expense.

exercise either the Renewal Option, on the one hand, or the Lessee Purchase
Option or the Sale Option, or a combination of both, on the other hand, all in
accordance with the terms set forth below:

<PAGE>   28
                 (a)      Renew this Lease as to all of the Equipment for an
         additional one year Renewal Term (the "Renewal Option") on the terms

         then subject to this Lease on the last day of the Initial Term or
         Renewal Term with respect to which such option is exercised (the
         Lessee Purchase Option").  If Lessee elects to exercise the Lessee
         Purchase Option with respect to all of the Functional Units then
         subject to this Lease, Lessee shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of
         the Lessors, the Purchase Option Exercise Amount, the Aggregate
         Make-Whole Premium (provided such premium shall not be due if such
         option is exercised at the end of the fifth Renewal Term) and any
         other amounts then due and payable by Lessee under the Lease or any
         other Operative Agreement.  If Lessee elects to exercise the Lessee
         Purchase Option with respect to Functional Units comprising less than
         all of the Functional Units then subject to this Lease, (A) Lessee
         shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, together with all
         Rent then due and payable the sum of the following amounts:

                          (i) the applicable Make-Whole Premium with respect to
                 each Functional Unit subject to the Lessee Purchase Option
                 (provided such premium shall not be due if such option is
                 exercised at the end of the fifth Renewal Term), and

                          (ii) with respect to each Functional Unit subject to
                 the Lessee Purchase Option, the greater of (x) the Functional
                 Unit Balance of such Functional Unit to be purchased or (y)
                 the Appraised Value of such Functional Unit at the date of
                 purchase, provided that in no event shall Lessee be required
                 to pay to Agent an amount greater than the Lease Balance
                 (after application of Proceeds pursuant to subsection (c)
                 below) plus the applicable Make-Whole Premiums if due as
                 provided for above and any other amounts then due and payable
                 by Lessee under the Lease and (B) Lessee shall be deemed to
                 have elected the Sale Option (defined below) with respect to
                 all of the remaining Functional Units, provided, however that
                 if after the Lessee's election of the Lessee Purchase Option
                 the total Purchase Price of the remaining Functional Units
                 represents less than 20% of the total Purchase Price of all
                 Functional Units subject to the Lease immediately prior to the
                 purchases contemplated by Sections 11.1(b) and 11.1(c), Lessee
                 shall be treated as having made the Lessee Purchase Option
                 with respect to all of the Functional Units;





                                       24
<PAGE>   29
                 (c)  (1)  Sell on behalf of Lessors on the Termination Date
         for cash, to a purchaser or purchasers not in any way affiliated with
         Lessee, the Functional Units not purchased by Lessee pursuant to the
         Lessee Purchase Option (the Sale Option"); provided, however, that
         Lessee may exercise the Sale Option only with respect to Functional
         Units whose aggregate Purchase Price represents at least 20% of the
         total Purchase Price of all Functional Units then subject to the
         Lease.  If Lessee elects the Sale Option with respect to Functional
         Units comprising less than all of the Functional Units then subject to
         this Lease, Lessee shall be deemed to have elected the Lessee Purchase
         Option with respect to all of the remaining Functional Units.

                          (2)  Simultaneously with dispositions pursuant to the
         Sale Option, Lessee shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of the
         Lessors, from the gross proceeds of such sales, without deductions or
         expense reimbursements (the Proceeds"), the Lease Balance as of the
         Termination Date (as determined after any payment of Rent due on such
         date) plus the applicable Make-Whole Premiums (except that no
         Make-Whole Premiums shall be payable by Lessee on Functional Units
         sold pursuant to an exercise of the Sale Option with respect to the
         second, fourth or fifth Renewal Term) and any other amounts then due
         and payable under any of the Operative Agreements.  If the Proceeds
         exceed the sum of the Lease Balance as of the Termination Date, plus
         applicable Make-Whole Premiums as of such date and any other payments
         then due and payable under any of the Operative Agreements, Lessee
         will retain the portion of the Proceeds in excess thereof.  If the
         Proceeds are less than the sum of the Lease Balance as of the
         Termination Date plus applicable Make-Whole Premiums as of such date
         and any other payments then due and payable under any of the Operative
         Agreements, Lessee will pay or will cause to be paid to Agent, for the
         benefit of the Lessors, on the Termination Date (i) the Proceeds and
         (ii) from its own funds, the sum of any payments then due and payable
         under any of the Operative Agreements, including any installments of
         Rent then due and payable, applicable Make-Whole Premiums (except that
         no Make-Whole Premiums shall be payable by Lessee on Functional Units
         sold pursuant to an exercise of the Sale Option with respect to the
         second, fourth or fifth Renewal Term) plus, at the option of the
         Required Lessors, either (x) the Applicable Percentage Amount or (y)
         the Recourse Deficiency Amount (the amount determined pursuant to this
         clause (ii) shall be referred to as the "Sale Recourse Amount");
         provided that in no event shall the Sale Recourse Amount exceed the
         Lease Balance and the applicable Make-Whole Premiums, if required
         above, after taking into account all payments of Rent and Proceeds.
         Agent, upon instruction of





                                       25
<PAGE>   30
         the Required Lessors, shall exercise the option in the preceding
         sentence by written notification to Lessee not later than ten Business
         Days prior to the last day of the Lease Term.  The obligation of
         Lessee to pay the Sale Recourse Amount shall be a recourse obligation
         of Lessee (and shall be in addition to any other recourse obligation
         of Lessee under any other provision of the Operative Agreements) and
         shall be payable on the date provided for in the preceding sentence.
         The Sale Recourse Amount and all Proceeds paid to Agent for the direct
         benefit of the Lessors shall be distributed in accordance with Article
         XXVIII.

         Section 11.2.    Election of Options.  Lessee's election of any of the
foregoing options in Section 11.1 shall be irrevocable at the time made, but if
Lessee fails to make a timely election, Lessee will be deemed, in the case of
the Initial Term and each Renewal Term then in effect (other than the fifth
Renewal Term) to have irrevocably elected the Renewal Option and, in the case
of the fifth Renewal Term, Lessee will be deemed to have irrevocably elected
the Lessee Purchase Option with respect to all of the Functional Units then
subject to this Lease.  In addition, if there exists an Event of Default at any
time after the Sale Option is properly elected, the Sale Option shall
automatically be revoked and Lessor shall be entitled to exercise all rights
and remedies provided in Article VIII.  Lessee may not elect the Sale Option if
there exists on the date the election is made an Event of Default or an event
which with the giving of notice and/or passage of time could become an Event of
Default.

         Section 11.3.    Sale Option Procedures.  If Lessee elects the Sale
Option, Lessee shall use its best commercial efforts to obtain the highest all
cash purchase price for the Functional Units subject to the Sale Option.  All
costs related to such sale and delivery, including, without limitation, the
cost of sales agents, removal of such Equipment, delivery of documents and
Equipment, certification and testing of such Equipment in any location chosen
by the buyer or prospective buyer, legal costs, costs of notices, any
advertisement or other similar costs, or other information and of any parts,
configurations, repairs or modifications desired by a buyer or prospective
buyer shall be borne entirely by Lessee, without regard to whether such costs
were incurred by Agent, the Lessors, Lessee or any potentially qualified buyer.
Neither Agent nor Lessors shall have any responsibility for procuring any
purchaser.  If, nevertheless, any Lessor, or Agent, at the direction of the
Required Lessors, undertakes any sales efforts, Lessee shall promptly reimburse
Agent or such Lessor for any charges, costs or expenses incurred in such
effort, including any allocated time charges, costs or expenses of internal
counsel or other attorneys' fees.  Equipment subject to the Sale Option shall
be in the condition required by Section 5.3 hereof at the time of the sale.
Agent, at the





                                       26
<PAGE>   31
direction of the Required Lessors, shall determine whether to accept the
highest all cash offer for the Equipment subject to the Sale Option.  Any
purchaser or purchasers of the Equipment shall not in any way be affiliated
with Lessee.  Pending the consummation of the Sale Option, Lessee shall at all
times maintain the Equipment in the condition required by Section 5.3, store
the Equipment without cost to the Lessors and keep all of the Equipment insured
in accordance with Article VII hereof.

         Section 11.4.    Payment of Excess Amounts.  Following the application
of all amounts required pursuant to Section 11.2, if the Appraised Value of any
Functional Unit sold pursuant to the Sale Option (without taking into account
any removal costs) as of the Termination Date is in excess of the Proceeds
attributable to any such Functional Unit, Lessee shall promptly pay to Agent,
for the benefit of the Lessors, such excess.

         Section 11.5.    Appraisals.  If Lessee gives notice of exercise of
the Sale Option with respect to one or more Functional Units, Agent (upon
direction from any Lessor) shall engage an appraiser of nationally recognized
standing reasonably acceptable to the Required Lessors, at Lessee's expense, to
determine (by appraisal methods satisfactory to Lessors holding at least 66.67%
of the Outstanding Investments in their sole and absolute discretion) the Fair
Market Value of the Equipment subject to the Sale Option as of (a) the first
day of any Renewal Term in which the Sale Option was elected, and (b) the
Termination Date.  The Appraised Value determined pursuant to this Section 11.5
shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Article XI.


                                  Article XII

                                     AGENT

         Section 12.1.    Appointment of Agent; Powers and Authorization to
Take Certain Actions.

                 (a)      Each Lessor irrevocably appoints and authorizes BA
         Leasing & Capital Corporation to act as agent hereunder, with such
         powers as are specifically delegated to Agent by the terms of this
         Lease, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
         thereto.  Each Lessor authorizes and directs Agent to, and Agent
         agrees for the benefit of the Lessors, that, on each Delivery Date it
         will accept the documents described in Articles II and III of the
         Participation Agreement.  Agent accepts the agency hereby created
         applicable to it and agrees to receive all payments and proceeds
         pursuant to this Lease and disburse such payments or proceeds in
         accordance with this Lease.  Agent





                                       27
<PAGE>   32
         shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set
         forth in this Lease and the Participation Agreement.  Agent shall not
         be responsible to any Lessor (or to any other Person) (i) for any
         recitals, statements, representations or warranties of any party
         contained in this Lease, the Participation Agreement, or in any
         certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or
         received by any of them under, this Lease or the other Operative
         Agreements, other than the representations and warranties made by
         Agent in Section 5.3 of the Participation Agreement, or (ii) for the
         value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
         sufficiency of the Collateral or the title thereto (subject to the
         Agent's obligations under Section 6.3 of the Participation Agreement)
         or of this Lease or any other document referred to or provided for
         herein or (iii) for any failure by Lessee, any Lessor or any other
         third party (other than Agent) to perform any of its obligations
         hereunder.  Agent may employ agents, trustees or attorneys-in-fact,
         may vest any of them with any property, title, right or power deemed
         necessary for the purposes of such appointment and shall not be
         responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any of them selected
         by it with reasonable care.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors,
         officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any
         action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, or in
         connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or
         willful misconduct.

                 (b)      Agent shall not have any duty or obligation to
         manage, control, use, operate, store, lease, sell, dispose of or
         otherwise deal with any item of Equipment or this Lease, or to
         otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in
         connection with, this Lease or any related document to which Agent is
         a party, except as expressly provided by the terms hereof, and no
         implied duties of any kind shall be read into this Lease against
         Agent.  The permissive right of Agent to take actions enumerated in
         this Lease shall never be construed as a duty, unless Agent is
         instructed or directed to exercise, perform or enforce one or more
         rights by the Required Lessors (provided that Agent has received
         indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it).  Subject to Section
         12.1(c) below, no provision of this Lease shall require Agent to
         expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
         liability in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, or
         in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder.  It is
         understood and agreed that the duties of Agent are ministerial in
         nature.

                 (c)      Except as specifically provided herein, Agent is
         acting hereunder solely as agent and, except as specifically





                                       28
<PAGE>   33
         provided herein, is not responsible to any party hereto in its
         individual capacity, except with respect to any claim arising from
         Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct or any breach of a
         representation or covenant made in its individual capacity.

                 (d)      Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to and
         otherwise deal with Lessee or any of its Affiliates with the same
         rights as it would have if it were not the named Agent hereunder.

         Section 12.2.    Reliance.  Agent may rely upon, and shall not be
bound or obligated to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated
in, any certificate, notice or other communication (including any communication
by telephone, telecopy, telex, telegram or cable) reasonably believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been made, signed or sent by or on behalf of
the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent with due care
(including any expert selected by Agent to aid Agent in any calculations
required in connection with its duties under this Lease).

         Section 12.3.    Action Upon Instructions Generally.  Subject to
Sections 8.2(d), 12.4 and 12.6, upon written instructions of the Required
Lessors, Agent shall, on behalf of the Lessors, give such notice or direction,
exercise such right, remedy or power hereunder or in respect of any item of
Equipment, and give such consent or enter into such amendment to any document
to which it is a party as Agent as may be specified in such instructions.
Agent shall deliver to each Lessor a copy of each notice, report and
certificate received by Agent described in Article X and Sections 5.4, 5.5,
6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 and 11.1 hereof and Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the
Participation Agreement.  Agent shall have no obligation to investigate or
determine whether there has been an Event of Default or an event which with the
passage of time and/or the giving of notice could result in an Event of
Default.  Agent shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of an Event of
Default or event which with the passage of time and/or the giving of notice
could result in an Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of Agent is
notified in writing of such Event of Default or event which with the passage of
time and/or the giving of notice could result in an Event of Default, provided
that Agent shall be deemed to have been notified in writing of any failure of
Lessee to pay Rent in the amounts and at the times set forth in Article III.
If Agent receives notice of an Event of Default, Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof, at Lessee's expense, to each Lessor.  Subject to Sections 8.2(d), 12.4
and 12.6 and Article XVII, Agent shall take action or refrain from taking
action with respect to such Event of Default as directed by the Required
Lessors; provided that, unless and





                                       29
<PAGE>   34
until Agent receives such directions, Agent shall refrain from taking any
action with respect to such Event of Default.  Prior to the date the Lease
Balance shall have become due and payable by acceleration pursuant to Section
8.2, Required Lessors may deliver written instructions to the Agent to waive,
and Agent shall waive pursuant thereto, any Event of Default and its
consequences;  provided that in the absence of written instructions from all
Lessors, Agent shall not waive any (i) Payment Default or (ii) covenant or
provision which, under Section 10.1 of the Participation Agreement, cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of all Lessors.  As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Lease, Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with
instructions signed by the Required Lessors and such instructions of the
Required Lessors and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding on each Lessor.

         Section 12.4.    Indemnification.  Each Lessor shall reimburse and
hold Agent harmless, ratably in accordance with its Lease Percentage at the
time the indemnification is required to be given, (but only to the extent that
any such indemnified amounts have not in fact been paid to Agent by, or on
behalf of, the Lessee in accordance with Section 7.1 of the Participation
Agreement) from any and all claims, losses, damages, obligations, penalties,
liabilities, demands, suits, judgments, or causes of action, and all legal
proceedings, and any reasonable costs or expenses in connection therewith,
including allocated charges, costs and expenses of internal counsel of Agent
and all other reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Agent, in any
way relating to or arising in any manner out of (i) this Lease or any other
Operative Agreement, the enforcement hereof or thereof or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (ii) instructions from the
Required Lessors (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses that
Lessee is obligated to and does not pay hereunder, but excluding normal
administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance by Agent of its
agency duties hereunder other than materially increased administrative costs
and expenses incurred as a result of an Event of Default), provided that no
Lessor shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from
(a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent, (b) the inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty or breach of any covenant given by Agent in
Section 5.3 or in Section 6.3 of the Participation Agreement or in this Lease,
(c) in the case of the Agent's handling of funds, the failure to act with the
same care as the Agent uses in handling its own funds or (d) any taxes, fees or
other charges payable by the Agent based on or measured by any fees,
commissions or compensation received by it for acting as Agent in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements.





                                       30
<PAGE>   35
         Section 12.5.    Independent Credit Investigation.  Each Lessor by
entering into this Lease agrees that it has, independently and without reliance
on Agent or any other Lessor and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of Lessee and its own
decision to enter into this Lease and all related documents to which it is a
party and that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any
other Lessor, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking action under this Lease and any related documents to which it is a
party.  Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by Lessee of any other document referred to (directly
or indirectly) or provided for herein or to inspect the properties or books of
Lessee.  Except for notices or statements which Agent is expressly required to
give under this Lease and for notices, reports and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to Agent alone (and not also to
each Lessor, it being understood that Agent shall forward copies of same to
each Lessor) hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement, Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lessor with copies of notices or
with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial
condition or business of Lessee (or any of its affiliates) that may come into
the possession of Agent or any of its Affiliates.

         Section 12.6.    Refusal to Act.  Except for notices and actions
expressly required of Agent hereunder and except for the performance of its
covenants in Section 6.3 of the Participation Agreement, Agent shall in all
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act unless (a) it is
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lessors against any and all
liability and reasonable expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action (provided that such indemnity
shall not be required to extend to liability or expense arising from Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct, it being understood that no action
taken, or not taken, by Agent in accordance with the instructions of the
Required Lessors shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part) and (b) it is reasonably satisfied that such action is
not contrary to this Lease or any other Operative Agreement or to any
applicable law.

         Section 12.7.    Resignation or Removal of Agent; Appointment of
Successor.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to each
Lessor or may be removed at any time by written notice from the Required
Lessors.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lessors at the
time of the resignation or removal shall have the right to appoint a





                                       31
<PAGE>   36
successor Agent which shall be a financial institution having a combined
capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000.  If, within 30 calendar days
after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or receipt of a
written notice of removal, a successor Agent is not so appointed and does not
accept such appointment, then the retiring or removed Agent may appoint a
successor Agent and transfer to such successor Agent all rights and obligations
of the retiring Agent.  Such successor Agent shall be a financial institution
having combined capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000.  Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent and the
retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from duties and obligations as
Agent thereafter arising hereunder and under any related document.  If the
retiring Agent does not appoint a successor, any Lessor shall be entitled to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such appointment, and such court
may thereupon appoint a successor to act until such time, if any, as a
successor shall have been appointed as above provided.

         Section 12.8.    Separate Agent.  The Required Lessors may, and if
they fail to do so at any time when they are so required, Agent may, for the
purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any item
of Equipment or Collateral may be located, appoint one or more individuals or
corporations either to act as co-agent jointly with Agent or to act as separate
agent of all or any part of the items of Equipment or Collateral or this Lease,
and vest in such individuals or corporations, in such capacity, such title to
the items of Equipment or Collateral or this Lease or any part thereof, and
such rights or duties as Agent may consider necessary or desirable.  Agent
shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is
not now so qualified.  Agent shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
instruments as may be required by any such co-agent or separate agent more
fully confirming such title, rights or duties to such co-agent or separate
agent.  Upon the acceptance in writing of such appointment by any such co-agent
or separate agent, it or he shall be vested with such interest in the items of
Equipment or Collateral and this Lease or any part thereof, and with such
rights and duties, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Lease, as shall
be specified in the instrument of appointment, jointly with Agent (except
insofar as local law makes it necessary for any such co-agent or separate agent
to act alone), subject to all terms of this Lease.  Any co-agent or separate
agent, to the fullest extent permitted by legal requirements of the relevant
jurisdiction, at any time, by an instrument in writing, shall constitute Agent
its attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power and authority to do all acts
and things and to





                                       32
<PAGE>   37
exercise all discretion on its behalf and in its name.  If any co-agent or
separate agent shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, the
interest in the items of Equipment or Collateral and this Lease and all rights
and duties of such co-agent or separate agent shall, so far as permitted by
law, vest in and be exercised by Agent, without the appointment of a successor
to such co-agent or separate agent.

         Section 12.9.    Termination of Agency.  The agency created hereby
shall terminate upon the final disposition by Agent of all Collateral at any
time subject hereto and the final distribution by Agent of all monies or other
property or proceeds received pursuant to this Lease in accordance with Article
XXVIII, provided that at such time Lessee shall have complied fully with all
the terms hereof.

         Section 12.10.   Compensation of Agency.  Lessee shall pay Agent its
reasonable and customary fees, costs and expenses for the performance of
Agent's obligations hereunder.


                                  Article XIII

                          OWNERSHIP, GRANT OF SECURITY
                        INTEREST AND FURTHER ASSURANCES

         Section 13.1.    Grant of Security Interest.  Title to the Equipment
shall remain in the Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, as security for the
obligations of Lessee hereunder and under each of the other Operative
Agreements to which it is a party until such time as Lessee has fulfilled all
of its obligations hereunder and under such other Operative Agreements.  Lessee
hereby assigns, grants and pledges to Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors, a
security interest in all of Lessee's right, title and interest, whether now or
hereafter existing or acquired, in the Collateral, to secure the payment and
performance of all obligations of Lessee now or hereafter existing under this
Lease or any other Operative Agreement.  Lessee shall, at its own cost and
expense, do any further act and execute, acknowledge, deliver, file, register
and/or record any further documents which Agent or any Lessor may reasonably
request in order to protect its or their title to and perfected security
interest in the Collateral, subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens, and
Agent's or Lessor's rights and benefits under this Lease.  Lessee shall
promptly and duly execute and deliver to Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors,
such documents and assurances and take such further action as Agent or Lessors
may from time to time reasonably request in order to carry out more effectively
the intent and purpose of this Lease and the other Operative Agreements, to
establish and protect the rights and remedies created or intended to be created
in favor of





                                       33
<PAGE>   38
Lessors and Agent hereunder and thereunder, and to establish, perfect and
maintain the right, title and interest of Agent or Lessors in and to the
Equipment, subject to no Lien other than Permitted Liens, or of such financing
statements, fixture filings, certificates of title or other documents with
respect hereto as Agent may from time to time reasonably request, and Lessee
agrees to execute and deliver promptly such of the foregoing financing
statements, fixture filings and certificates of title or other documents as may
require execution by Lessee.  To the extent permitted by applicable laws,
Lessee hereby authorizes any such financing statements, fixture filings and
certificates of title to be filed without the necessity of the signature of
Lessee.  Upon Lessee's request and at such time as all of the obligations of
Lessee under this Lease and any other Operative Agreement have been
indefeasibly paid or performed in full (other than Lessee's contingent
obligations, if any, under Articles VII and VIII of the Participation
Agreement), Agent shall, and Agent is hereby authorized by Lessors to act on
their behalf to, execute and deliver termination statements and other
appropriate documentation reasonably requested by Lessee, all at Lessee's own
cost and expense, to evidence Agent's release of Agent's security interest in
the Collateral.  At such time, Agent shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill
of sale (without representations or warranties except that the Equipment is
free and clear of Lessor Liens) for the Equipment.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such release shall not relieve Lessee of its continuing obligations
under Articles VII, VIII, and XI of the Participation Agreement or any other
provision of an Operative Agreement which survives the termination hereof.

         Section 13.2.    Retention of Title or Proceeds in the Case of
Default.  If Lessee would be entitled to any amount (including any Casualty
Proceeds or Partial Casualty Proceeds) or title to any item of Equipment
hereunder but for the existence of any Event of Default or event which with the
giving of notice and/or passage of time could become an Event of Default, Agent
shall, on behalf of the Lessors, hold such amount or item of Equipment as part
of the Collateral and shall be entitled to apply such amounts against any
amounts due hereunder, provided that Agent shall distribute such amount or
transfer such Equipment in accordance with the other terms of this Lease if and
when no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice and/or
passage of time could become an Event of Default exists.


                                  Article XIV

                                EFFECT OF WAIVER

         No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing
to Lessors upon any breach or default of Lessee





                                       34
<PAGE>   39
hereunder shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy preclude
other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy, nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver
of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring.  Any
waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of
Lessors of any breach or default under this Lease must be specifically set
forth in writing and must satisfy the requirements set forth in Article XVII
with respect to approval by Lessors.


                                   Article XV

                             SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS

         All claims pertaining to the representations, warranties and covenants
of Lessee under Articles II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, X, XI, XXI and XXII shall
survive the termination of this Lease to the extent such claims arose out of
events occurring or conditions existing prior to any such termination.


                                  Article XVI

                                 APPLICABLE LAW

                        EFFECT AND MODIFICATION OF LEASE

has been prominently marked "Counterpart No. 1 -- Agent's Original Copy."  Only
the counterpart marked "Counterpart No. 1 -- Agent's Original Copy" shall

or to be chattel paper for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, and such
copy shall be held by Agent, for the benefit of the Lessors.


                                   Article XX

                                  SEVERABILITY

in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law; but if any

                                  ASSIGNMENTS

otherwise transfer (including pursuant to a participation) all or any portion
of its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the Operative
Agreements, any Collateral and its interest in the Equipment except that
without the prior written consent of the Agent or the Lessee (x) any bank or
similar financial or commercial lending institution may pledge its interest in
the ordinary course of its business without the consent of the Lessee or the
Agent; provided, that no transfer upon a foreclosure pursuant to such a pledge
may occur unless this Section (other than clause (x)) is complied with, (y) any
Lessor may transfer all or any portion of its interest to any other existing
Lessor and (z) any Lessor may transfer any or all of such right, title and
interest as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) below:

                 (a)      Transfers to Affiliates.  Subject to the satisfaction
         of the conditions set forth in this Section 22.2, any Lessor may make
         any such assignment, conveyance or transfer to any Affiliate if such
         transferee's obligations under the Operative Agreements shall have
         been unconditionally guaranteed by such Lessor by an instrument in
         form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent; provided that
         the term of such Lessor's guarantee shall not be required to extend
         past March 31, 1995.

                 (b)      Transfers to Non-Affiliates.  Subject to the
         satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 22.2, any
         Lessor may make any such assignment, conveyance or transfer to any
         entity which does not qualify as a transferee under the preceding
         paragraph (a) if (x) (i) such entity has a consolidated net worth of
         at least $100,000,000 as at the end of its most recent fiscal year, or
         (ii) such transferee entity's obligations under the Operative
         Agreements shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by the
         transferor by an instrument in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Lessee and the Agent or (iii) such transferee
         entity's obligations under the Operative Agreements are
         unconditionally guaranteed by an instrument in form and substance

         controlling such





                                       37
<PAGE>   42
         transferee entity, if such entity would qualify as a transferee entity
         under clause (i) hereof and (y) the provisions of Section 22.2(d)
         through (i) below are satisfied with respect to such transfer.

                 (c)      Transfer with Consent.  Any transfer to an entity
         other than one satisfying the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)
         or (b) of this Section 22.2 may only be made with the prior written
         consent of the Lessee and the Required Lessors, which consent shall
         not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                 (d)      Required Notice and Effective Date.  Any Lessor
         desiring to effect a transfer of its interest hereunder shall give
         written notice of each such proposed transfer to the Lessee, the Agent
         and each other Lessor at least ten (10) days prior to such proposed
         transfer, setting forth the name of such proposed transferee, the
         percentage or interest to be retained by such Lessor, if any, and the
         date on which such transfer is proposed to become effective.  All
         reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Agent in connection
         with any such disposition by a Lessor under this Section 22.2 shall be
         borne by such Lessor.  In the event of a transfer under this Section
         22.2, any expenses incurred by the transferee in connection with its
         review of the Operative Agreements and its investigation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby shall be borne by such transferee or
         the relevant Lessor, as they may determine, but shall not be
         considered costs and expenses which the Lessee is obligated to pay or
         reimburse under Section 11.5 of the Participation Agreement.

                 (e)      Assumption of Obligations.  Any transferee pursuant
         to this Section 22.2 shall have executed and delivered to the Agent a
         letter in substantially the form of the Investors Letter attached
         hereto as Exhibit A, and thereupon the obligations of the transferring
         Lessor under the Operative Agreements shall be proportionately
         released and reduced to the extent of such transfer.  Upon any such
         transfer as above provided, the transferee shall be deemed to be bound
         by all obligations (whether or not yet accrued) under, and to have
         become a party to, all Operative Agreements to which its transferor
         was a party, shall be deemed the pertinent "Lessor" for all purposes
         of the Operative Agreements and shall be deemed to have made that
         portion of the payments pursuant to the Participation Agreement
         previously made or deemed to have been made by the transferor
         represented by the interest being conveyed; and each reference herein
         and in the other Operative Agreements to the pertinent "Lessor" shall
         thereafter be deemed a reference to the transferee, to the extent of
         such transfer,





                                       38
<PAGE>   43
         for all purposes.  Upon any such transfer, the Agent shall deliver to
         each Lessor and the Lessee a new Schedule I to the Participation
         Agreement, revised to reflect the relevant information for such new
         Lessor and the Commitment of such new Lessor (and the revised
         Commitment of the transferor Lessor if it shall not have transferred
         its entire interest).

                 (f)      Employee Benefit Plans.  No Lessor may make any such
         assignment, conveyance or transfer to or in connection with any
         arrangement or understanding in any way involving any employee benefit
         plan (or its related trust), as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
         with the assets of any such plan (or its related trust), as defined in
         Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (other than a governmental plan, as
         defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), with respect to which the Lessee
         or such Lessor or any of their Affiliates is a party in interest
         within the meaning of ERISA or a "disqualified person" within the
         meaning of the Code.

                 (g)      Limitation on Transfers.  Notwithstanding paragraphs
         (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 22.2, any Lessor proposing to
         transfer its interest may not make any such assignment, conveyance or
         transfer at any time when there shall have occurred and be continuing
         any material default of such Lessor to the Lessee under the
         Participation Agreement.

                 (h)      Amount of Commitment.  No Lessor may make any such
         assignment, conveyance or transfer if, as a consequence thereof, the
         transferor (if such Lessor retains any part of its Commitment) or
         transferee Lessor would have a Commitment (assuming for this purpose
         no funding by such Lessor) of less than U.S. $2,000,000.

                 (i)      Representations and Warranties.  Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary set forth above, no Lessor may assign, convey
         or transfer its interest to any Person, unless such Person shall have
         delivered to the Agent and the Lessee a certificate confirming the
         accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
         5.2 of the Participation Agreement with respect to such Person (other
         than as such representation or warranty relates to the execution and
         delivery of Operative Agreements).

broker, finder, investment banker or other third party to act on its behalf,
directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder, investment banker, agent or any
other like capacity in connection with this Lease or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that Lessee has retained BA Leasing & Capital
Corporation as arranger in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and Lessee shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold
Agent and each Lessor harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, or demands by BA Leasing & Capital Corporation, in its capacity as
arranger in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, for fees or
other entitlements with respect to this Lease or the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Participation Agreement.

                                   JURY TRIAL

         LESSEE WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS LEASE OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT OR
UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY
IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM
ANY RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LEASE OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT
AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND
NOT BEFORE A JURY.

                                 Article XXVII

                        DISTRIBUTION AND APPLICATION OF
                            RENTS AND OTHER PAYMENTS

         Section 28.1.    Pro Rata Payment.  Except as specifically provided
for at Section 8.4 of this Lease or Section 4.5 of the Participation Agreement,
all amounts of money received or realized by Agent pursuant to any Operative
Agreement which are to be distributed to the Lessors (other than
indemnification payments payable to any Lessor by Lessee under any Operative
Agreement and after payment of accrued fees, expenses and indemnification
payments payable to Agent in its capacity as Agent that have been due and
unpaid for 30 days or more) shall be distributed to each Lessor pro rata,
without preference or priority of any Lessor over another, in accordance with
the amounts due each Lessor at the time of such payment in respect of the types
of obligations described in the Section pursuant to which the distribution is
being made; provided, however, that in the case where the aggregate amount to
be so paid to the Lessors in accordance herewith shall be insufficient to pay
such amounts due to Lessors on such distribution, then such amount shall be
distributed ratably, without priority of one such Person over the other, in the
proportion that the amount which would have been distributed to each such
Person pursuant to this provision, but for such insufficiency, bears to the
aggregate amount which would have been distributed to all Persons except for
such insufficiency; and provided, further, with respect to Rent, that all
amounts shall be applied first to the interest component thereof and then to
the principal component.

Rykoff-Sexton, Inc.
[Address For Notice]


BA Leasing & Capital Corporation,
not individually, but solely as Agent
[Address For Notice]


Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Capitalized terms used in this letter and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned thereto in that certain Participation
Agreement (the "Participation Agreement"), dated as of April ___, 1994, among
Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as Lessee, Tone Brothers, Inc., an
Iowa corporation, as Sublessee, certain institutions listed on Schedule I
thereto, and BA Leasing & Capital Corporation, a California corporation, as
Agent, unless the context otherwise requires.  The undersigned has agreed to
purchase the interest of _____________ as a Lessor under the Participation
Agreement and the other Operative Agreements (as defined therein), representing
a Commitment of (amount) Dollars $(_________) (the "Interest"), and desires
that the Lessee execute and deliver to Agent and that Agent authenticate and
deliver to the undersigned and to each Lessor a new Schedule I to the
Participation Agreement evidencing the Commitment of the undersigned pursuant
to Section 22.2 of the Lease.  The undersigned hereby represents and warrants
as of the date hereof to the addressees hereof as follows:

                 (a)      The undersigned will be acquiring the Interest with
         funds which constitute general account assets and not assets of any
         separate account in which any employee benefit plan has any interest
         or with assets allocated to an insurance company pooled separate
         account as defined in ERISA Section 3(17) maintained by a Lessor which
         satisfies the requirements of U.S. Department of Labor Prohibited
         Transaction Class Exemption 90-1 with respect to the transactions
         contemplated by the Lease in order for such transactions to be exempt
         from the prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
         Code;

                 (b)      The Interest is being acquired by the undersigned for
         investment and not with a view to the resale or
<PAGE>   49
         distribution of such Interest or any part thereof, but without
         prejudice, however, to the right of the undersigned at all times to
         sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Interest under a
         registration available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
         or under an exemption from such registration available under such Act,
         it being understood that the disposition by the undersigned of the
         Interest to be purchased by the undersigned shall, at all times,
         remain entirely within its control;

                 (c)      neither the undersigned nor any Person authorized to
         act on its behalf has directly or indirectly offered to sell any
         interests in the Collateral, the Interest or any security similar
         thereto, to, or otherwise approved or negotiated with respect thereto
         with, anyone other than the Lessors, and neither it nor any Person
         authorized to act on its behalf will so offer or sell in violation of
         Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or securities or
         blue sky law of any applicable jurisdiction; and

                 (d)      the undersigned agrees to treat its Interest for
         federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes as
         indebtedness of the Lessee.

         The undersigned understands that the Interest has not been and will
not be registered or qualified under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
any securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction and that no participant
has an obligation to effect such registration or otherwise assist in the
disposition of the Interest.


                                                 Very truly yours,

                                    SUBLEASE

         SUBLEASE, dated as of April 29, 1994 between Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Sublessor"), and Tone Brothers, Inc., an Iowa
corporation ("Sublessee").

                                    RECITALS

         (A)     Sublessor is Lessee under that certain Lease Intended as
Security, dated as of April 29, 1994 (as from time to time thereafter amended
or supplemented, the "Lease") with the Lessors listed on the signature pages
thereto and BA Leasing & Capital Corporation, not individually, but solely as
agent for the benefit of the Lessors ("Agent").  Unless otherwise defined
herein or the context hereof otherwise requires, terms which are defined or
defined by reference in the Lease shall have the same meanings when used herein
as such terms have therein, whether or not the Lease is then in effect.

         (B)     Sublessor desires to lease to Sublessee, and Sublessee desires
to lease from Sublessor, the items of equipment described on Schedule I hereto,
as from time to time hereafter amended ("Sublease Items").

         Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         SECTION 1.  LEASE.  Sublessor leases to Sublessee and Sublessee leases
from Sublessor the Sublease Items described on Schedule I hereto, as such
description may from time to time be hereafter amended with the consent of
Assignee (as hereinafter defined).

         SECTION 2.  TERM.  The term of this Sublease shall be concurrent with
the term of the Lease and termination of the Lease (including, without
limitation, termination pursuant to Article X thereof) shall constitute
automatic termination of this Sublease. Termination of the Lease with respect
to any but not all of the Sublease Items shall constitute automatic termination
of this Sublease only with respect to the Sublease Items no longer subject to
the Lease.

         If Sublessor elects to exercise the Lessee Purchase Option as provided
inSection 11.1(b) of the Lease, Sublessor shall sell to Sublessee, and
Sublessee shall purchase from Sublessor, the Sublease Items subject thereto for
(i) the portion of the Purchase Option Exercise Amount, any applicable
Make-Whole Premiums and any other amounts then due and payable attributable to
such Sublease Items or, (ii) if less than all of the Equipment is subject to
such Lessee Purchase Option, the aggregate of the amounts that are required to
be paid by Sublessor to Agent under Section 11.1(b)(A) of the Lease
attributable to such Sublease
<PAGE>   2
Items.  Such payment for such Sublease Items shall be made by Sublessee
concurrently upon Sublessor's payment to the Agent pursuant to Section
11.1(b)(A) of the Lease.  Upon payment by the Sublessee for Sublease Items,
Sublessor shall execute and deliver to Sublessee a quitclaim bill of sale
(without representations or warranties) for such Sublease Items.

         If Sublessor elects to exercise the Sale Option as provided inSection
11.1(c) of the Lease, Sublessee shall on the last day of the Lease Term permit
a purchaser of any Sublease Item to take possession thereof.  Sublessee shall
pay to Sublessor an amount equal to the amount payable by Sublessor pursuant to
Section 11.1(c)(2)(ii) of the Lease attributable to the Sublease Items.  Such
payment for the Sublease Items shall be made by Sublessee on the date that the
Section 11.1(c)(2)(ii) amount is payable by Sublessor to Lessor under the
Lease.  If such purchaser cannot take possession of a Sublease Item on the last
day of the Lease Term, the Sublessee shall store such Sublease Item for a
reasonable period of time, but shall at all times comply with the last sentence
of Section 11.3 of the Lease.

         SECTION 3.  RENT.  The rent and rental payment dates shall be as
agreed from time to time by Sublessor and Sublessee; provided, however, that if
Assignee is exercising its rights with respect to this Sublease or any Sublease
Items, rent shall be payable quarterly on the Sublease Items on each April 30,
July 30, October 30 and January 30 and shall be in an amount, with respect to
each Sublease Item, equal to that portion of the rental under the Lease and
applicable Lease Supplement attributable to such Sublease Item.

         SECTION 4.  WARRANTIES.  NEITHER SUBLESSOR NOR ANY ASSIGNEE MAKES ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY WHATSOEVER OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
ANY PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE REGARDING ANY SUBLEASE ITEM OR ANY PART THEREOF.

         SECTION 5.  LEASE.  This Sublease is in all respects subject and
subordinate to the Lease (and each Lease Supplement governing any Sublease
Item) and the Liens created thereby.  Without limiting the foregoing, if for
any reason Assignee shall exercise rights or remedies thereunder, such exercise
may include the termination hereof, notwithstanding, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, any right of Sublessee hereunder.  Sublessee shall in all
respects comply with all of the terms and provisions of Article V of the Lease.

         SECTION 6.  ASSIGNMENT; SUBLEASE.  Sublessor shall have the right to
assign, and has assigned to Agent concurrently with entering into this
Sublease, all or any part of its right, title and interest in and to this
Sublease and shall have the right to grant and has granted to Agent for the
benefit of the Lessors a





                                      -2-
<PAGE>   3
security interest in the Sublease Items to the Agent (in this capacity,
"Assignee", which term shall also be deemed to refer to any successor or assign
of Agent in such capacity) pursuant to the Lease.  Such assignment and grant
shall (i) be superior to Sublessee's rights hereunder; (ii) not relieve
Sublessor of any of its obligations hereunder; and (iii) not be construed to be
an assumption by Assignee of any obligations of Sublessor hereunder.  Upon
written request of Assignee, Sublessee shall make all payments of rent directly
to Assignee, at such address as Assignee shall specify.  Sublessee shall, upon
request, execute and deliver such instruments and take such other action as may
reasonably be requested to protect Sublessor's or Assignee's interests.  This
Sublease shall not be amended, modified or waived without the consent of
Assignee.  Sublessee acknowledges that this Sublease has been assigned, and a
security interest in the Sublease Items has been granted, to Agent under the
Lease.  Sublessee shall not assign any right or interest in this Sublease.

         Except as expressly provided in this Section 6, any further
assignment, sublease or transfer of the Sublease or of all or any portion of
the Sublease Items is prohibited.

         SECTION 7.  NOTICES.  Notices shall be in writing and shall be deemed
to be given when delivered personally, by facsimile (and confirmed, which
confirmation may be mechanical) or otherwise actually received or five Business
Days after being sent, first class mail postage prepaid, and addressed to
Sublessor, Sublessee and Assignee at their respective addresses set forth on
Schedule II hereto, or at such other address as any such party from time to
time provides to the other parties in accordance with this Section 7.

         SECTION 8.  MISCELLANEOUS.  This Sublease shall be governed by the
laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles.
Only one counterpart of this Sublease shall be marked as the sole original
execution copy hereof, and such counterpart shall be held by Assignee.  Each of
Sublessor and Sublessee waives any right to trial by jury in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Sublease or any instrument, document or
agreement now or hereafter relating to this Sublease.  If any provision hereof
shall be prohibited or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Sublease.  This Sublease shall be binding upon Sublessor and Sublessee and
shall inure to the benefit of Sublessor, Sublessee, Assignee and the successors
and assigns of Assignee.

<PAGE>   4
         SECTION 9.  SECURITY INTEREST.  Sublessee hereby grants a security
interest in the Sublease Items and proceeds thereof (the "Collateral") to
Sublessor to secure Sublessee's obligations under this Sublease.  Sublessee
shall, at its own cost and expense, do any further act and execute,
acknowledge, deliver, file, register and/or record any further documents which
Sublessor (or Assignee) may reasonably request in order to protect its
perfected security interest in the Collateral.

HAND DELIVERED
Harold E. Feather


Dear Harold:

         As a follow up to our meeting of May 3rd and 4th, I am confirming the
agreement between you and Rykoff-Sexton, Inc. (the "Company") concerning your
employment.

         You will be employed by the Company as Executive Vice
President-Corporate Planning on a full time basis until December 31, 1998, with
an annual salary of not less than $275,000 and an annual car allowance of
$7200.  You will be eligible to participate in the Company's employee benefit,
stock option, and incentive plans, subject to the terms and conditions of such
plans, as the same may be changed from time to time (the "Plans").  You will
continue to participate in the Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") at your
current level of thirty-five percent (35%) unless the Company's Chief Executive
Officer determines that your performance requires an adjustment to be made to
your level of participation or the SEIP is modified or eliminated.

         If, prior to December 31, 1998, your employment is terminated by you
for any reason, or your employment is terminated by the Company on account of
your death, disability or "Cause" as defined in that certain Change of Control
Agreement between you and the Company dated December 11, 1989 ("Cause"), no
further salary payments will be made to you.

         If, prior to December 31, 1998, your employment is terminated by the
Company for any reason other than your death, disability, or Cause, your salary
will be paid to you through December 31, 1998, provided that you do not
directly or indirectly engage in any activity which competes with the Company.

<PAGE>   2
         If, prior to  December 31, 1998, your employment is terminated by you
or the Company for any reason, no further car allowance payments will be made
to you and your eligibility to continue to participate in the Company's Plans
will be governed by the terms of the Plans and applicable law.

         If you remain employed by the Company until December 31, 1998, you
will become an "at-will" employee of the Company at that time.  This means that
your employment after December 31, 1998 will have no specific or definite term
and that either you or the Company may terminate the relationship at any time
with or without cause and with or without notice.

         This letter agreement is to be governed by the substantive laws of the
State of Illinois applicable to contracts to be performed wholly within that
state.  If this letter agreement accurately reflects our understanding, please
sign and return a copy to the Company.

                                         Very truly yours,
                                         
                                         /s/ Mark Van Stekelenburg
                                         -------------------------
                                         Mark Van Stekelenburg

Agreed and Accepted

                        (EFFECTIVE AS OF JULY 20, 1994)
<PAGE>   2
                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT



                 THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of the 20th day of July, 1994, by and between RYKOFF-SEXTON, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and MARK VAN STEKELENBURG, a California resident
(the "Executive").

                 WHEREAS, the Executive has been serving as the President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company since December, 1992;

                 WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to employ the
Executive upon the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement and the
Executive desires to remain in the employ of the Company upon such terms and
conditions; and

                 WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to set forth in
a written agreement certain of the terms and conditions of Executive's
employment with the Company;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the
mutual covenants herein contained, it is agreed as follows:

                 1.       Employment.  The Company hereby agrees to continue to
employ the Executive and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of
the Company upon the terms and conditions herein set forth.

                 2.       Term.  Employment shall be for a term commencing on
the date hereof and, subject to termination under Section 8, expiring five (5)
years from the date hereof.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, this
Agreement and the employment of the Executive shall be automatically renewed
(subject to Section 8) for successive one-year periods upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, commencing on the fifth anniversary of the date of
this Agreement, and on each anniversary date thereafter, unless either party to
this Agreement gives the other party written notice (in accordance with Section
16) of such party's intention to terminate this Agreement and the employment of
the Executive at least twelve months prior to the end of such initial or
extended term.  For purposes of this Agreement, any reference to the "term" of
this Agreement shall include the original term and any extension thereof.

                 3.       Duties of the Executive.  The Executive shall serve
as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, subject to the
pleasure of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), and shall otherwise
be assigned only executive policy and management duties.  The Executive shall
devote substantially all of his normal working time and his best efforts, full
attention and energies to the business of the Company, the responsibilities
provided for the President and Chief Executive Officer in the Company's Bylaws,
and such other





                                       1
<PAGE>   3
related duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be reasonably
prescribed by the Board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and with the advance
approval of the Board, which approval may be withheld for any reason, the
Executive may serve on the boards of directors of unrelated companies and may
devote reasonable time to fulfilling his responsibilities as a member of such
boards.  The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Executive to be
elected as a member of its Board throughout the term of this Agreement and
shall include him in the management slate for election as a director at every
stockholders' meeting at which his term as a director would otherwise expire.

                 4.       Compensation.

                          (a)     During the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall pay to the Executive a base salary of not less than $450,000 per
annum, which base salary may be increased (but not decreased) from time to time
by the Board in its sole discretion, payable at the times and in the manner
consistent with the Company's general policies regarding compensation of
executive employees.  Such base salary shall include any salary reduction
contributions to (i) any Company-sponsored plan that includes a
cash-or-deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), (ii) any other plan of deferred compensation
sponsored by the Company, or (iii) any Company-sponsored "cafeteria plan" under
Code Section 125.  The Board may from time to time authorize such additional
compensation to the Executive, in cash or in property, as the Board may
determine in its sole discretion to be appropriate.

                          (b)     If the Board authorizes cash incentive
compensation under the Senior Executive Incentive Plan or such other management
incentive program or arrangement approved by the Board, the Executive shall be
eligible to participate in such plan, program or arrangement under the terms
and conditions applicable to executive and management employees; provided
however, that the potential annual incentive amount for the Executive as
determined by the Board shall be not less than 50% of the Executive's annual
base salary.

                          (c)     If the Board authorizes grants under the
Company's employee stock option plans in effect from time to time, the
Executive shall participate in any such award in accordance with the award
schedules and other terms and conditions of such plans as approved by the
Board.

                 5.       Executive Benefits.

                          (a)     In addition to the compensation described in
Section 4, the Company shall make available to the Executive, subject to the
terms and conditions of the applicable plans, including without limitation the
eligibility rules, participation for the Executive and his eligible dependents
in the following Company-sponsored employee benefit plans or any successor
plans adopted by the Company: (i) Basic Life Insurance;





                                       2
<PAGE>   4
(ii) Supplemental Life Insurance; (iii) Basic Accidental Death and
Dismemberment Insurance ("AD&D"); (iv) Supplemental AD&D; (v) Business Travel
Accident Insurance; (vi) Short-term Disability Insurance; (vii) Long-term
Disability Insurance; (viii) Medical and Dental Plan; (ix) the Rykoff-Sexton,
Inc. Pension Plan (the "Qualified Pension Plan"); and (x) the Rykoff-Sexton,
Inc. Value Plan; notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right
to amend or terminate each of the foregoing plans at any time.  The level of
coverage and benefit options available now and hereafter to the Executive under
the foregoing plans shall be the usual and customary benefits offered by the
Company to other executive and management employees of the Company.

                          (b)     The Company shall make available to the
Executive and his eligible dependents, subject to generally applicable plan
eligibility rules, such other usual and customary benefits now or hereafter
offered by the Company to other employees of the Company, and such other
benefits and perquisites as may be made available by the Board to the Executive
or generally to other executive and management employees of the Company.

                          (c)     The Executive shall be provided with
retirement benefits under that certain Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
for Mark Van Stekelenburg (the "Supplemental Retirement Plan"), the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, subject to all of the terms and
conditions thereof.

                          (d)     In addition to any life insurance coverage
made available to the Executive under Section 5(a), the Company shall continue
to provide to the Executive, as the owner of the contract (or, alternatively,
to his designee, as the owner) a term life insurance contract on the
Executive's life in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000)
and to reimburse the Executive, on an after-tax basis, for the cost of such
insurance.

                 6.       Expenses.  The Company shall also pay or reimburse
the Executive for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Executive
in connection with his duties on behalf of the Company in accordance with the
general policies of the Company.

                 7.       Place of Performance.  In connection with his
employment by the Company, the Executive shall be based at the principal
executive offices of the Company, except for travel reasonably required for
Company business.

                 8.       Termination.

                          (a)     Involuntary Termination.  The Executive's
employment hereunder may be terminated by the Company for any reason by written
notice as provided in Section 16.  The Executive's Disability (as defined
herein) during the term of the Agreement shall constitute an involuntary
termination of





                                       3
<PAGE>   5
employment hereunder, unless the Board expressly extends such employment for a
specified time thereafter.  The Executive will be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been involuntarily terminated by the Company if the
Executive terminates his employment with the Company under the following
circumstances: (i) the Company has breached any material provision of this
Agreement and within 30 days after notice thereof from the Executive, the
Company fails to cure such breach; (ii) at any time after the Company has
notified the Executive pursuant to Section 2 hereof that the Company intends to
terminate the Agreement and the Executive's employment (rather than allow the
Agreement to automatically renew); (iii) a successor or assign (whether direct
or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company fails to assume
liability under the Agreement or the Supplemental Retirement Plan; (iv) the
Executive fails to be elected to the Board; (v) the Board fails to appoint the
Executive as President and Chief Executive Officer; or (vi) the Board's
consistent failure, after appropriate efforts by the parties, to approve the
Executive's bona fide strategic plan as presented from time to time such that a
reasonable executive would conclude that the parties hold irreconcilable
differences in vision and direction for the Company.

                          (b)     Voluntary Termination.  The Executive may
voluntarily terminate the Agreement (including without limitation by retirement
under the terms of the Supplemental Retirement Plan) at any time by notice to
the Company as provided in Section 16.  The Executive's death during the term
of the Agreement shall constitute a voluntary termination of employment for
purposes of eligibility for Termination Payments and Benefits as provided in
Section 9.

                          (c)     Subject to Section 9 and any benefit
continuation requirements of applicable laws, in the event the Executive's
employment hereunder is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated for any reason
whatsoever, the compensation and benefits obligations of the Company under
Sections 4 and 5 shall cease as of the effective date of such termination,
except for any compensation and benefits earned or accrued but unpaid through
such date.

                 9.       Termination Payments and Benefits.  If the
Executive's employment hereunder is involuntarily terminated by the Company
other than for Cause (as defined herein) prior to the end of the term of this
Agreement, then the Company shall be obligated to pay to the Executive certain
termination payments and make available certain benefits during the termination
payment period, as follows:

                          (a)     Termination Payment Period.  Termination
payments shall be made for two years.

                          (b)     Calculation of Termination Payments.
                 Subject to subsections (f) and (h), termination payments
                 calculated on an annual basis shall equal the sum of (i) the
                 Executive's highest annual base salary during the three-year
                 period prior to the Executive's termination plus (ii) the
                 Executive's average annual cash incentive compensation award,
                 including without limitation any award under the Senior
                 Executive Incentive Program or any successor plan thereto,
                 during the three-year period prior to the Executive's
                 termination.

                          (c)     Method of Payment.  Termination payments
                 shall be paid to the Executive in accordance with the
                 Company's regular payroll schedule.  If the Executive should
                 die while any amounts are still payable to him hereunder, all
                 such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid
                 to the Executive's surviving spouse, or, if she is not then
                 living, in accordance with the Executive's Beneficiary
                 Designation under Section 14.01 of the Qualified Pension Plan
                 or, if the Executive fails to name such a Beneficiary or the
                 named Beneficiary predeceases him, in accordance with the
                 order of priority in Section 14.02 of the Qualified Pension
                 Plan.

                          (d)     Benefits.  Notwithstanding any provision to
                 the contrary in any option agreement or in any plan, (i) all
                 of the Executive's outstanding stock options shall immediately
                 become exercisable upon involuntary termination of the
                 Executive, and (ii) the Executive shall be credited with two
                 additional Years of Service under the Supplemental Retirement
                 Plan; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply in
                 the case of an involuntary termination of the Executive's
                 employment that occurs after the fifth anniversary of the date
                 of this Agreement.

                                  During the termination payment period as set
                 forth above in subsection (a), the Company shall use its best
                 efforts to maintain in full force and effect for the continued
                 benefit of the Executive all employee welfare benefit plans
                 and perquisite programs in which the Executive was entitled to
                 participate immediately prior to the Executive's termination
                 or shall arrange to make available to the Executive benefits
                 substantially similar to those which the Executive would
                 otherwise have been entitled to receive if his employment had
                 not been terminated.  Such welfare benefits shall be provided
                 to the Executive on the same terms and conditions (including
                 employee contributions toward the premium payments) under
                 which the Executive was entitled to participate immediately
                 prior to his termination.  The Company does not guarantee a
                 favorable tax consequence to the Executive for





                                       5
<PAGE>   7
                 continued coverage and benefits under the Company-sponsored
                 plans nor will it indemnify the Executive for such results
                 except with respect to the life insurance plan made available
                 by the Board under Section 5(d).

                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
                 to the Executive's continued coverage under the Company's
                 Medical and Dental plan, or a successor plan, pursuant to this
                 provision, the Executive's "qualifying event" for purposes of
                 the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
                 ("COBRA") shall be his date of termination from the Company.

                                  Any termination payments hereunder shall not
                 be taken into account for purposes of any retirement plan or
                 other benefit plan sponsored by the Company (including the
                 Supplemental Retirement Plan), except as otherwise expressly
                 required by such plans or applicable law.

                          (e)     Termination for Cause.  For purposes of this
                 Agreement, "Cause" shall mean

                                  (i)      the willful and continued failure by
                                  the Executive to substantially perform his
                                  duties hereunder (other than any such failure
                                  resulting from the Executive's incapacity due
                                  to physical or mental illness), after demand
                                  for substantial performance is delivered by
                                  the Company that specifically identifies the
                                  manner in which the Company believes the
                                  Executive has not substantially performed his
                                  duties,

                                  (ii)     the willful engaging by the
                                  Executive in misconduct which is materially
                                  injurious to the Company, monetarily or
                                  otherwise, or

                                  (iii) the material breach of the
                                  Confidentiality and Nonsolicitation Agreement
                                  set forth in Section 10.

                 No act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be
                 considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by
                 him not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his
                 action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.
                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be
                 deemed to have been terminated for Cause without (x)
                 reasonable notice to the Executive setting forth the reasons
                 for the Company's intention to terminate for Cause, (y) an
                 opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel, to
                 be heard before the Board, and (z) delivery





                                       6
<PAGE>   8
                 to the Executive of a written notice of termination from the
                 Board finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board,
                 the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above in
                 clause (i), (ii) or (iii) hereof, and specifying the
                 particulars thereof in detail.

                          (f)     Effect of Change in Control Agreement.  If
                 the Executive also becomes entitled to receive severance
                 payments under the terms of the Amended and Restated Change in
                 Control Agreement between the Company and the Executive, dated
                 as of October 12, 1993 (the "Change in Control Agreement"),
                 then the Executive's termination payments under this Agreement
                 shall be reduced by the amount of severance payments payable
                 in any given year under Section 3(B) of the Change in Control
                 Agreement.

                          (g)     Disability Defined.  "Disability" shall mean
                 the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness
                 to substantially perform his duties on a full-time basis for
                 six (6) consecutive months and within thirty (30) days after a
                 notice of termination is thereafter given by the Company the
                 Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance
                 of the Executive's duties; provided, however, if the Executive
                 shall not agree with a determination to terminate him because
                 of Disability, the question of the Executive's disability
                 shall be subject to the certification of a qualified medical
                 doctor agreed to by the Company and the Executive or, in the
                 event of the Executive's incapacity to designate a doctor, the
                 Executive's legal representative.  In the absence of agreement
                 between the Company and the Executive, each party shall
                 nominate a qualified medical doctor and the two doctors shall
                 select a third doctor, who shall make the determination as to
                 Disability.

                          (h)     Effect of Long-Term Disability.  If the
                 Executive also becomes entitled to receive benefits under an
                 insured long-term disability insurance plan ("LTD Plan") now
                 or hereafter paid for by the Company, then the Executive's
                 termination benefits under this Agreement (calculated on a
                 monthly basis) shall be reduced by the amount of the benefits
                 paid under such LTD Plan.  No such reduction shall be made for
                 benefits paid to the Executive under a personal disability
                 income plan or such other disability income plan paid for by
                 the Executive, whether or not the plan was obtained through a
                 group-sponsored or Company-related program.

                          (i)     No Obligation to Mitigate.  The Executive is
                 under no obligation to mitigate damages or the amount of any
                 payment provided for hereunder by seeking other employment or
                 otherwise; provided, however, that the





                                       7
<PAGE>   9
                 Executive's coverage under the Company's welfare benefit plans
                 will terminate when the Executive becomes covered under any
                 employee benefit plan made available by another employer and
                 covering the same type of benefits.  The Executive shall notify
                 the Company within thirty (30) days after the commencement of
                 any such benefits.

                          (j)     Forfeiture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                 any right of the Executive to receive termination payments and
                 benefits hereunder shall be forfeited to the extent of any
                 amounts payable after any breach of Section 10 or Section 11
                 by the Executive.

                 10.      Confidentiality and Nonsolicitation Agreement.

                          (a)     The Executive acknowledges that in the course
of his employment by the Company, he will or may have access to and become
informed of confidential and secret information which is a competitive asset of
the Company ("Confidential Information"), including, without limitation, (i)
the terms of any agreement between the Company and any employee, customer or
supplier, (ii) pricing strategy, (iii) merchandising and marketing methods,
(iv) product development ideas and strategies, (v) personnel training and
development programs, (vi) financial results, (vii) strategic plans and
demographic analyses, (viii) proprietary computer and systems software, and
(ix) any non-public information concerning the Company, its employees,
suppliers or customers.  The Executive agrees that he will keep all
Confidential Information in strict confidence during the term of his employment
by the Company and thereafter and will never directly or indirectly make known,
divulge, reveal, furnish, make available, or use any Confidential Information
(except in the course of his regular authorized duties on behalf of the
Company).  The Executive agrees that the obligations of confidentiality
hereunder shall survive termination of his employment at the Company regardless
of any actual or alleged breach by the Company of this Agreement, until and
unless any such Confidential Information shall have become, through no fault of
the Executive, generally known to the public or the Executive is required by
law to make disclosure (after giving the Company notice and an opportunity to
contest such requirement).  The Executive's obligations under this Section 10
are in addition to, and not in limitation of or preemption of, all other
obligations of confidentiality which the Executive may have to the Company
under general legal or equitable principles.

                          (b)     Except in the ordinary course of the
Company's business, the Executive has not made, nor shall at any time following
the date of this Agreement, make or cause to be made, any copies, pictures,
duplicates, facsimiles or other reproductions or recordings or any abstracts or
summaries including or reflecting Confidential Information.  All such documents
and other property furnished to the Executive by the Company or otherwise
acquired or developed by the Company shall





                                       8
<PAGE>   10
at all times be the property of the Company.  Upon termination of the
Executive's employment by the Company, the Executive will return to the Company
any such documents or other property of the Company which are in the
possession, custody or control of the Executive.

                          (c)     Without the prior written consent of the
Company (which may be withheld for any reason or no reason), except in the
ordinary course of the Company's business, the Executive shall not at any time
following the date of this Agreement use for the benefit or purposes of the
Executive or for the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm,
partnership, association, trust, venture, corporation or business organization,
entity or enterprise engaged in the "Restricted Business" (as herein defined),
or disclose in any manner to any person, firm, partnership, association, trust,
venture, corporation or business organization, entity or enterprise engaged in
the Restricted Business, any Confidential Information.  "Restricted Business"
means any business or division of a business which consists of the
manufacturing or sale, for distribution to customers that are primarily
restaurants, cafes, bars, hotels, schools, colleges and other institutions (as
the word "institution" is customarily defined in the wholesale grocery
business) of (i) processed or bulk food and other groceries; (ii) restaurant
and commercial kitchen supplies (such as paper products, janitorial supplies,
consumable stores and supplies of every kind and nature); and (iii) restaurant
and commercial kitchen equipment (such as cookware, appliances, glassware,
dinnerware, smallwares and similar items), and likewise includes any business
of a kind in whole or in part similar to that heretofore engaged in by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                          (d)     In the event of the Executive's voluntary or
involuntary termination of employment at the Company, the Executive agrees that
he will not in any capacity, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other firm,
person or entity, undertake or assist in the solicitation of any employee of
the Company, including, but not limited to, solicitation of any employee to
terminate his or her employment with the Company.

                          (e)     The Executive acknowledges and agrees that a
violation of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10 (referred to
collectively as the Confidentiality and Nonsolicitation Agreement) that results
in material detriment to the Company would cause irreparable harm to the
Company, and that the Company's remedy at law for any such violation would be
inadequate.  In recognition of the foregoing, the Executive agrees that, in
addition to any other relief afforded by law or this Agreement, including
damages sustained by a breach of this Agreement and any forfeitures under
Section 9, and without any necessity or proof of actual damages, the Company
shall have the right to enforce this Agreement by specific remedies, which
shall include, among other things, temporary and permanent injunctions, it
being the understanding of the undersigned parties hereto that





                                       9
<PAGE>   11
damages, the forfeitures described above and injunctions shall all be proper
modes of relief and are not to be considered as alternative remedies.

                 11.      Post-termination Assistance.  The Executive agrees
that after his employment with the Company has terminated he will provide, upon
reasonable notice, such information and assistance to the Company as may
reasonably be requested by the Company in connection with any litigation in
which it or any of its affiliates is or may become a party; provided, however,
that the Company agrees to reimburse the Executive for any related expenses,
including travel expenses.

                 12.      Arbitration.  Any dispute between the Executive and
the Company under this Agreement shall be resolved (except as provided below)
through informal arbitration by an arbitrator selected under the rules of the
American Arbitration Association (located in Los Angeles, California) and the
arbitration shall be conducted in that location under the rules of said
Association.  Each party shall each be entitled to present evidence and
argument to the arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have the right only to
interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement and may not change any of
its provisions.  The arbitrator shall permit reasonable pre-hearing discovery
of facts, to the extent necessary to establish a claim or a defense to a claim,
subject to supervision by the arbitrator.  The determination of the arbitrator
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties and judgment upon the same may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator shall give
written notice to the parties stating his or their determination, and shall
furnish to each party a signed copy of such determination.  The expenses of
arbitration shall be borne equally by the Executive and the Company or as the
arbitrator shall otherwise equitably determine.

                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to seek or participate in arbitration regarding any breach of the
Executive's Confidentiality and Nonsolicitation Agreement contained in Section
10, but may pursue its remedies for such breach in a court of competent
jurisdiction in Los Angeles, California.

                 13.      Agreement.  This Agreement supersedes any and all
other Agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and contains all of the covenants and
agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter.  Each party
to this Agreement acknowledges that no representations, inducements, promises,
or other agreements, orally or otherwise, have been made by any party, or
anyone acting on behalf of any party, pertaining to the subject matter hereof,
which are not embodied herein, and that no other agreement, statement, or
promise pertaining to the subject matter hereof that is not contained in this
Agreement shall be valid or binding on either party.

<PAGE>   12
                 14.      Withholding of Taxes.  The Company may withhold from
any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other
taxes as the Company is required to withhold pursuant to any law or government
regulation or ruling.

                 15.      Successors and Binding Agreement.

                          (a)     The Company will require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization
or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive,
expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and
to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place.  This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including without
limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger,
consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor shall thereafter
be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but will not
otherwise be assignable, transferable or delegable by the Company.

                          (b)     This Agreement will inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives,
executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and legatees.

                          (c)     This Agreement is personal in nature and
neither of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign,
transfer or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder
except as expressly provided in Sections 15(a) and 15(b).  Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive
payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether
by pledge, creation of a security interest, or otherwise, other than by a
transfer by Executive's will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in
the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section
15(c), the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be
assigned, transferred or delegated.

                 16.      Notices.  For all purposes of this Agreement, all
communications, including without limitation notices, consents, requests or
approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and
will be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by
electronic facsimile transmission (with receipt thereof confirmed), or five
business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three business days after
having been sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such as
Federal Express, UPS, or Purolator, addressed to the Company (to the attention
of the Secretary of the Company) at its principal executive office

                              ARTICLE 1. THE PLAN

         1.1     Establishment.  RYKOFF-SEXTON, INC. (the "Employer"), hereby
establishes, effective as of July 20, 1994, a supplemental deferred
compensation plan for the benefit of Mark Van Stekelenburg (the "Participant"),
who is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Employer.
This Plan shall be known as the RYKOFF-SEXTON, INC. SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE
RETIREMENT PLAN FOR MARK VAN STEKELENBURG (the "Plan").

         1.2     Purpose.  The purpose of the Plan is to encourage the
Participant's continued interest in the Employer's success and to enhance his
security by providing him with additional retirement and survivor benefits that
will supplement his benefits under the Employer's Qualified Pension Plan.

                 The Plan is intended to provide benefits for a "management or
highly compensated" employee within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of
ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of
Title I of ERISA.  Accordingly, in the event that it is determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that the Plan constitutes an employee pension benefit
plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, which is not so exempt, the
Plan shall thereafter be modified and operated and administered in such a
manner as to comply with the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of
ERISA, or if the Plan cannot be so modified or operated, the Plan shall
terminate in accordance with Article 8 and no further benefits shall accrue
hereunder.

                             ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS

         2.1     Definitions.  Whenever used in the Plan, the following words

context plainly requires a different meaning.  When the defined meaning is

                 2.1.1    "Actuarial Equivalent" means a benefit of equal value
computed by using the applicable actuarial assumptions and factors stated for
the applicable purpose in the Qualified Pension Plan, as in effect on the

                 2.1.2    "Affiliate" means John Sexton & Co., Tone Brothers,
Inc. or any other business entity that is owned by the Employer or a member of
a "related group" (as that term is defined in the Qualified Pension Plan) with
the Employer.

                 2.1.3    "Annuity Starting Date" means that term as defined in
Article X of the Qualified Pension Plan, except that Annuity Starting Date
shall relate to the commencement of benefits under this Plan.

                 2.1.4    "Base Compensation" means the total annual base
salary paid by the Employer to or on behalf of the





                                       1

Participant, including any salary reduction contributions to (a) any
Employer-sponsored plan that includes a cash-or-deferred arrangement under Code
Section 401(k), (b) any other plan of deferred compensation sponsored by the
Employer, or (c) any Employer-sponsored "cafeteria plan" under Code Section
125.

                 Base Compensation shall not take into account any reimbursed
expenses, benefits paid under any Employer-sponsored welfare benefit plan,
credits or benefits under any plan of deferred compensation (including this
Plan) attributable to Employer contributions, any additional cash incentive
compensation under the Senior Executive Incentive Plan or such other management
incentive program or arrangement approved by the Board, compensation payable in
a form other than cash or any termination payments under the Employment
Agreement.

                 2.1.5    "Benefit Percentage" means sixty percent (60%),
reduced by three percent (3%) for each Year of Service of the Participant less
than twenty (20), determined as of the date of the Participant's Termination of
Employment.

                 2.1.6    "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it
has been and may be amended from time to time.

                 2.1.7    "Committee" means the Advisory Committee from time to
time appointed by the Board of Directors of the Employer pursuant to its
Qualified Pension Plan.  The Committee shall be this Plan's named fiduciary.

                 2.1.8    "Disability" shall have the meaning set forth in the
Employment Agreement.

                 2.1.9    "Early Retirement Date" means the date on which the

         4.1     Normal Retirement Benefits.

                 (a)  If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on
or after the date on which he has attained Normal Retirement Age and has
completed five (5) Years of Service, the Employer shall pay to the Participant,
in monthly payments, an annual benefit equal to: (i) the product of (I) the
Participant's Final Average Earnings multiplied by (II) his Benefit Percentage;
reduced by (ii) the accrued benefit the Participant would be entitled to
receive on an annual basis under the Qualified Pension Plan, assuming the
Participant elected to commence receiving a straight life annuity form of
benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan, as of the Annuity Starting Date for
commencement of his benefits under this Plan.

                 (b)  Payments under this Section 4.1 shall commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant's
Termination of Employment and shall continue on the first day of each month
thereafter during the Participant's lifetime, unless the Participant is
reemployed by the Employer or an Affiliate.

         4.2     Benefits Upon Early Retirement.

                 (a)  If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs
before he attains Normal Retirement Age, but on or after the date on which he
has reached his Early Retirement Date, the Employer shall pay to the
Participant a benefit equal to the retirement benefit payable at Normal
Retirement Age under Section 4.1, determined as of the date of his Termination
of Employment, and reduced by one-half of one percent (0.5%) for each month
that the date of commencement of benefits under this paragraph 4.2 precedes the
Participant's attainment of his Normal Retirement Age.

                 (b)  Payments under this Section 4.2 shall commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant's
Termination of Employment and shall continue on the first day of each month
thereafter during the Participant's lifetime, unless the Participant is
reemployed by the Employer or an Affiliate.

         4.3     Disability Benefits.

                 (a)  If the Participant's Termination of Employment is caused
by his Disability and occurs after his completion of one (1) but less than ten
(10) Years of Service, the Employer shall pay to the Participant a benefit
equal to the retirement benefit described in Section 4.1, determined (i) as of
the date of his Termination of Employment, (ii) by using a Benefit Percentage
equal to thirty percent (30%), and (iii) without any reduction for early
commencement of benefits.

<PAGE>   8
                 (b)  If the Participant's Termination of Employment is caused
by his Disability and occurs on or after the Participant has been credited with
ten (10) or more Years of Service, the Employer shall pay to the Participant a
benefit equal to the retirement benefit described in Section 4.1, determined
(i) as of the date of his Termination of Employment, and (ii) without any
reduction for early commencement of benefits.

                 (c)  Payments under this Section 4.3 shall commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the end of the salary
continuation period for the Participant under any noninsured salary
continuation plan or arrangement payable upon the Participant's Disability
either provided by the Employer or included in the Employment Agreement, and
shall continue on the first day of each month thereafter for the Participant's
lifetime, unless the Participant is reemployed by the Employer or an Affiliate.

         4.4     Deferred Vested Benefits.

                 (a)  If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs
prior to his Early Retirement Date, but after he has completed five (5) Years
of Service, he shall receive a deferred retirement benefit commencing
immediately after his Early Retirement Date, equal to the Actuarial Equivalent
of his retirement benefit payable at Normal Retirement Age under Section 4.1,
determined as of the date of his Termination of Employment.

                 (b)  Payments under this Section 4.4 shall commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant's
Early Retirement Date and shall continue on the first day of each month
thereafter during the Participant's lifetime, unless the Participant is
reemployed by the Employer or an Affiliate.

         4.5     Social Security Reduction.  Benefits payable to the Participant
under Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 shall be reduced by the amount of
unreduced primary (not family) annual retirement benefits under the United
States Social Security Act that the Participant is paid ("Social Security
benefits").

         4.6     Benefits upon Reemployment.  If the Participant is reemployed
by the Employer or an Affiliate, any benefits in pay status shall be
discontinued until the Participant again terminates employment.  If a
Participant receives a benefit under the Plan and again becomes a Participant,

reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the payments previously made to him.

                          ARTICLE 5. SURVIVOR BENEFITS

         5.1     Death Prior to Retirement.  If the Participant dies prior to
his Annuity Starting Date, his Surviving Spouse (if any) shall be eligible for
survivor benefits from the Employer.  Such benefits shall be payable monthly by
the Employer until the Surviving Spouses's death.  The Surviving Spouse benefit
under this provision shall equal sixty percent (60%) of the Participant's
retirement benefit payable at Normal Retirement Age under Section 4.1
determined (a) as if the Participant had a Termination of Employment upon his
death, and (b) without a reduction for the Participant's accrued benefit under
the Qualified Pension Plan.  Pre-retirement survivor payments under this Plan
will be reduced by the monthly survivor benefit actually paid to the Surviving
Spouse under the Qualified Pension Plan.

         5.2     Death After Commencement of Benefits.  If the Participant dies
after his Annuity Starting Date, the Employer shall pay to the Participant's
Surviving Spouse (if any) post-retirement survivor benefits.  Such benefits
shall be payable monthly by the Employer until the Surviving Spouse's death.
The Surviving Spouse benefit shall equal sixty percent (60%) of the retirement
benefit received by the Participant pursuant to the applicable provision of
this Plan; provided, however, that, for purposes of this provision, the
Participant's retirement benefit shall not be reduced by his accrued benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan.  Post-retirement survivor benefit payments
under this Plan will be reduced by the monthly guaranteed payments or survivor
benefits actually paid to the Surviving Spouse under the Qualified Pension
Plan.

                     ARTICLE 6. CLAIMS AND REVIEW PROCEDURE

         6.1     Claims Procedure.  If the Participant or, in the event of his
death, his Surviving Spouse (either hereinafter referred to as the "Claimant")
is not for any reason paid all or a portion of an expected benefit under this
Plan he or she may file a claim with the Committee.  The Committee shall notify
the Claimant, within ninety (90) days of receipt of the claim, of the
Committee's allowance or denial of the claim.  The notice of the Committee's
decision shall be in writing, signed by the Claimant, sent by mail to the
Claimant's last known address and, if a denial of all or a portion of the
claim, shall set forth:

                 (a)      the specific reasons for the denial;

                 (b)      specific reference to the provisions of the Plan on
         which the denial is based;

                 (c)      if applicable, a description of any additional
         information or material necessary to perfect the claim, and an
         explanation of why it is needed; and





                                       6
<PAGE>   10
                 (d)      an explanation of the Plan's claims review procedure,
         including the names of members of the Committee and the name and
         address of the Committee member to whom any petition for review should
         be directed.

                 If the Committee determines that special circumstances require
additional time to make a decision, the Committee shall notify the Claimant
(within the 90-day period for the Committee's response) of the circumstances
and the date by which a decision is expected, and may extend the response
period for up to an added 90-day period.

         6.2     Review Procedure.  If a Claimant is determined by the Committee
to be ineligible for benefits, or if the Claimant believes that he or she is
entitled to greater or different benefits, the Claimant shall have the
opportunity to appeal the Committee's determination by filing a petition for
review with the Committee within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice of
decision issued by the Committee.  The petition shall be in writing signed by
the Claimant and shall state the specific reasons why the Claimant believes he
or she is entitled to benefits or to greater or different benefits.

                 Within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Committee of the
petition, the Committee shall afford the Claimant (and an authorized
representative, if any) an opportunity to present his or her position to the
Committee orally or in writing, and the Claimant (or an authorized
representative) shall have the right to review the pertinent documents.  The
Committee shall notify the Claimant of its decision in writing within the
60-day period, stating specifically the basis of its decision (written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant) and the specific provisions
of the Plan on which the decision is based.  If, because of the need for a
hearing, the 60-day period is not sufficient, the decision may be deferred for
up to another 60-day period at the election of the Committee, but notice of
this deferral shall be given to the Claimant.

                           ARTICLE 7. ADMINISTRATION

<PAGE>   11
                 (c)      to determine the Participant's eligibility for
         benefits under the Plan and the amount of benefits payable to the

         any).

         7.3     Actions of the Committee.  All determinations, interpretations,
rules, and decisions of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding upon all
persons having or claiming to have any interest or right under the Plan.

         7.4     Delegation.  The Committee shall have the power to delegate
specific duties and responsibilities to officers or other employees of the
Employer or other individuals or entities.  Any delegation by the Committee may
allow further delegations by the individual or entity to whom the delegation is

person or entity to whom a duty or responsibility has been delegated shall be
responsible for the exercise of such duty or responsibility and shall not be
responsible for any act or failure to act of any other person or entity.

         7.5     Reports and Records.  The Committee and those to whom they have
delegated duties under the Plan shall keep records of all their proceedings and
actions and shall maintain books of account, records and other data as shall be

applicable law.

                      ARTICLE 8. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         8.1     Procedures for Amending Plan.

                 (a)      The Employer may not amend, suspend or terminate the
Plan, in full or in part, at any time without the written consent of the
Participant.  Any action to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan may only be
taken by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Employer.

                 (b)      No amendment, suspension or Plan termination after
the death of the Participant, shall adversely affect the rights of the
Surviving Spouse who is then entitled to receive payments under the Plan as a
result of the previous occurrence of the Participant's death.


                 (c)      Any amendment, suspension or termination documents
shall be filed with the Plan documents, and written notice thereof given the
Participant or, in the event of his death, his Surviving Spouse.

         8.2     Termination of Plan.  In the event of Plan termination, the
Employer may elect to accelerate payments of the Actuarial Equivalent value of
all plan benefits previously accrued (whether or not commenced) either in a
cash lump sum payable within sixty (60) days from the Plan termination date or,
in the sole discretion of the Employer, in sixty (60) equal monthly





                                       8
<PAGE>   12
installments commencing within that 60-day period, with interest at the
Actuarial Equivalent rate applicable to Qualified Pension Plan termination
payments, compounded annually.

                            ARTICLE 9. MISCELLANEOUS

         9.1     No Guaranty of Employment.  The adoption and maintenance of
the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract of employment between the
Employer and the Participant.  Nothing contained herein shall give the
Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer or to
interfere with the right of the Employer to discharge the Participant at any
time, nor shall it give the Employer the right to require the Participant to
remain in its employ or to interfere with the Participant's right to terminate
employment at any time.

         9.2     Financing of Benefits.  Benefits payable under the Plan to the
Participant or, in the event of his death, to his Surviving Spouse shall be
paid by the Employer from its general assets.  The rights of the Participant,
or his Surviving Spouse, to benefits under the Plan shall be solely those of an
unsecured creditor of the Employer.

                 (a)      The Employer in its discretion may apply for and
procure as owner and for its own benefit, insurance on the life of the
Participant, in such amounts and in such forms as the Employer may choose.  The
Participant shall have no interest whatsoever in any such policy or policies,
but at the request of the Employer shall submit to medical examinations and
supply such information and execute such documents as may be required by the
insurance company or companies to whom the Employer has applied for insurance.
Any insurance policy on the life of the Participant or other assets acquired by
or held by the Employer (whether or not held in trust) shall not be deemed to
be held as security for the performance of the Plan obligations of the Employer
but shall be, and remain, a general, unpledged, and unrestricted asset of the
Employer.

                 (b)      The Employer may establish a trust to facilitate
management of any life insurance or other assets which may be used to pay Plan
benefits, but the assets of any such trust shall remain subject to the claims
of the Employer's general creditors, and neither the Participant, nor his
Surviving Spouse or estate, shall have the right to any of such assets, except
in their capacity as unsecured general creditors of the Employer.  To the
extent that any of the benefits accrued for the Participant under this Plan are
paid to the Participant or his Surviving Spouse by the trustee of such a trust,
the Employer's obligation to pay that portion of the Participant's benefits
under this Plan shall be discharged to the extent of the trustee's payment.

         9.3     Non-Alienation.  No benefit payable at any time under this Plan
shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, attachment or encumbrance of any kind.





                                       9
<PAGE>   13
         9.4     Taxes.  The Employer shall deduct, from all payments to be made
hereunder, all applicable federal and state taxes required by law to be
withheld from the payments.

         9.5     Applicable Laws.  The Plan and all rights hereunder shall be
governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of California,
except to the extent such laws are preempted by the laws of the United States
of America.

         9.6     Form of Communication.  Any election, application, claim,
notice or other communication required or permitted to be made by the
Participant or, in the event of his death, his Surviving Spouse to the
Committee shall be made in writing and in such form as the Committee shall
prescribe.  Such communication shall be effective upon mailing, if sent by
first class mall, postage pre-paid, and addressed to the Employer's principal
offices at Los Angeles, California, to the attention of the "Pension Advisory
Committee" or one of its members.

         9.7     Captions.  The captions at the head of the Articles and
Sections of this Plan are designed for convenient reference only and are not to
be used for the purpose of interpreting any provision of this Plan.

         9.8     Severability.  The invalidity of any portion of this Plan shall
not invalidate the remainder thereof, and in any such case the remainder shall
continue in full force and effect, to the extent that any purposes of the Plan
may still be carried out.

         9.9     Binding Agreement.  The provisions of this Plan shall be
binding upon the Participant, his Surviving Spouse and his, her and their heirs
and personal representatives.

         9.10 Successors.  The Employer shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the
Employer expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Plan in the same
manner and to the same extent the Employer would be required to perform if no
such succession had taken place.  This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Employer and any successor of or to the Employer, including
without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Employer whether by
sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor
shall thereafter be deemed the "Employer" for the purposes of this Plan), and
the heirs, beneficiaries, executors and administrators of the Participant.

         9.11 Facility of Payment.  Whenever and as often as Participant or, in
the event of his death, his Surviving Spouse entitled to payments hereunder
shall be under a legal disability or, in the sole judgment of the Committee,
shall otherwise be unable to apply such payments to his own best interests and





                                       10
<PAGE>   14
advantage, the Committee in the exercise of its discretion may direct all or
any portion of such payments to be made in any one or more of the following
ways:  (a) directly to him; (b) to his legal guardian or conservator; or (c) to
his spouse or to any other person, to be expended for his benefit; and the
decision of the Committee, shall in each case be final and binding upon all
persons in interest.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and pursuant to a duly adopted resolution of the
Employer's Board of Directors, the Employer has caused this instrument to be
executed by its duly authorized officers as of the Effective Date.

(1) Investment tax credits and other tax credits have been recorded as
reductions of the provision for income taxes. In the 10-year period ended April
30, 1994, such credits approximated $893,000 in 1986 and $822,000 in 1985. No
significant amounts were available in 1994 to 1987.

(2) Adjusted to reflect a stock split in the form of 25% stock dividend
distributed on January 16, 1989. When convertible subordinated debentures were
outstanding, fully diluted earnings per share were $.90 in 1987, $.97 in 1986
and $1.26 in 1985.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

   Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations
and financial condition includes the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto and the following additional information.

Results of Operations
   For the fiscal year ended April 30, 1994, the Company's sales were $1.525
billion, an increase of $36.6 million or 2.5% over the prior year.  This sales
growth resulted from the introduction of new product lines and new sales and
marketing programs, and was achieved despite the closure of several inefficient
operations, and the adverse effects of the Los Angeles earthquake and severe
winter weather in the Midwest and East. For the fiscal year ended  May 1, 1993,
sales declined $30.9 million or 2.0% from fiscal 1992. This decrease was due to
the effect of an additional week of operations in fiscal 1992, elimination of a
few selected customer accounts, closure of five small operations and continued
weak market conditions, particularly in California where the Company has a high
concentration of business. Inflation was approximately 1.0% in fiscal 1994 and
was not a significant factor in fiscal 1993; however, sales in fiscal 1992
reflected overall price deflation of approximately 2.0%.

   The gross profit margin for fiscal 1994 declined to 22.8% from 23.1% in
fiscal 1993 primarily because of the introduction of new product lines, changes
in customer mix and aggressive new sales and marketing programs. The gross
profit margin for fiscal 1993 declined to 23.1% from 24.1% in fiscal 1992
because of customer and product mix changes, as well as lower prices that were
due, in part, to the competitive environment.

   Warehouse, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.3
million or 2.8% to $321.7 million in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993, primarily
because of the Company's progress in containing costs and improving operating
efficiencies under its Project RESULTS program. For fiscal 1993, warehouse,
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.6 million or 2.0% to
$331.0 million from fiscal 1992. This decrease reflected the effect of the
extra week of operations and a non-recurring charge of $4.3 million related to
the settlement of litigation in fiscal 1992, which is more fully described in
Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In fiscal 1993,
an additional provision of $1.4 million was recorded primarily for bad debts on
two large accounts that filed for bankruptcy protection. After excluding the
effects of the additional provision of $1.4 million in fiscal 1993, the extra
week of operations and the litigation settlement in fiscal 1992, the Company's
operating expenses for fiscal years 1993 and 1992 were comparable.  As a
percentage of sales, the Company's operating expenses decreased to 21.1% in
fiscal 1994 from 22.2% in fiscal 1993 and 1992.

   Interest expense for fiscal years 1994 and 1993 was comparable at $13.2
million and $13.4 million, respectively. In fiscal 1993, interest expense
increased by $2.4 million from 1992 due to increased interest rates associated
with the sale of $100 million of 8.60% senior notes in April 1992 and increased
borrowings during the year.

   In fiscal 1993, the Company provided for a one-time restructuring charge of
$31.0 million for a business reorganization. This charge included provisions
for facility closures, relocation of distribution centers into more efficient
facilities, consolidation of the Company's two distribution divisions,
workforce reductions and the implementation of new warehouse and transportation
systems throughout the Company.  Management believes that these changes, which
have been part of the Company's Project RESULTS program, will improve the
Company's operating performance, although there can be no assurances that these
changes will have such an effect. On an ongoing basis, management also
considers strategic acquisitions and divestitures.

   Effective May 2, 1992, the Company adopted SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income
Taxes," which is more fully described in Note 1 to the accompanying financial
statements. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 1994 was 40.5% as compared
to the effective income tax benefit rate of 37.0% in fiscal 1993, and the
effective tax rate of 40.0% in fiscal 1992. The 1993 effective tax benefit rate
was impacted by valuation allowances which were established to reflect the
expected effect on income taxes of the one-time restructuring charge. The
cumulative positive effect of the change in the method of accounting for income
taxes for fiscal 1993 was $732,000, or $.06 per share.

   Income before extraordinary item and change in accounting rose to $7.4
million in fiscal 1994 from a loss of $19.7 million in fiscal 1993.  This
improvement resulted from the sales gains and operating expense reductions that
were achieved in fiscal 1994 and also reflects the impact of the restructuring
charge in the prior year. For fiscal 1993, the $19.7 million loss before the
change in accounting for income taxes represented a decrease of $29.7 million
from fiscal 1992, which was due primarily to the one-time restructuring charge
and reduced gross profit margins.

   The extraordinary item in fiscal 1994 of $1.4 million, net of tax benefit,
resulted from the write-off of deferred finance costs associated with early
retirement of the Company's 8.60% senior notes and its outstanding senior
indebtedness under a prior bank credit facility as more fully described in Note
2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
   Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 1994 was $31.2 million as
compared to $41.0 million in fiscal 1993. This decrease was due mainly to cash
expended for the previously provided restructuring charge. Additionally,
increases in net income, accounts payable, accruals and deferred taxes did not
fully offset increases in accounts receivable and inventories.

   For fiscal 1994 and 1993, cash flows used in investing activities consisted
of capital expenditures of $37.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively. The
increase in fiscal 1994 is due primarily to expenditures for the construction
of the new manufacturing plant for Tone Brothers, Inc. In April 1994, the
Company also entered into an equipment sale and leaseback arrangement with
various lessors, which generated proceeds of $16.1 million.

   The Company borrows on a regular basis in order to fund its ongoing
operations. In November 1993, the Company issued $130 million principal amount
of 8 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes (the "8 7/8% Notes") and concurrently
obtained from a bank, a new $100 million credit line and $15 million letter of
credit facility, which was subsequently increased to $20 million (the "Credit
Facility"). The proceeds from the issuance of the 8 7/8% Notes, together with
borrowings under the Credit Facility, were used to retire $128.1 million
principal amount of 8.60% senior notes and outstanding senior indebtedness
under the prior bank credit facility. In fiscal 1993, the Company used cash
from operations, together with borrowings of $15.0 million under its credit
line, to make principal payments of $9.7 million on certain of its 8.60% senior
notes and other long-term debt, to repay short-term borrowings of $20.0 million
and to pay dividends of $3.8 million.

   Working capital was $159.9 million with a current ratio of 2.1:1 at April
30, 1994 as compared to working capital of $150.5 million with a current ratio
of 2.1:1 at May 1, 1993. On April 30, 1994, current assets were approximately
63% of the total assets of the Company.

   The Company plans to relocate its Los Angeles distribution branch to a new
facility in fiscal 1995. The cost of this new facility is estimated to be $45.0
million. The Company is considering various alternatives for financing this
facility, but is initially funding the construction under its Credit Facility.

   At its meeting of March 8, 1993, the Board of Directors suspended the
payment of dividends on the Company's common stock. The last quarterly cash
dividend in the third quarter of fiscal year 1993 was $.075 per share. Under
the Credit Facility, the Company is restricted from declaring dividends in
excess of 10% of Consolidated Net Earnings, as defined, in fiscal 1994. In
fiscal 1995 and beyond, it cannot declare dividends in any fiscal year in
excess of the sum of Consolidated Net Earnings Available for Restricted
Payments, plus the Fixed Charge Coverage Amount, as defined.

Depreciation, Amortization, Retirement and Maintenance Policies
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based upon the
following estimated useful lives:

Cost of normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
Replacements or betterments of properties are capitalized. When assets are
retired or otherwise disposed of, their cost and the applicable accumulated
depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts, and the resulting
gain or loss is reflected in income.

Other Assets
Other assets are amortized on the straight-line method over the following
periods:

Accumulated amortization of other assets was $10,420,000 and $16,259,000 as of
April 30, 1994 and May 1, 1993, respectively.

Income Taxes
The Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred
method to the liability method required by "Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes," effective May 3,
1992. Income taxes for fiscal year 1992 have not been restated for this change.
Under SFAS 109, a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the
estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and
carryforwards. The measurement of deferred income tax assets is adjusted by a
valuation reserve, if necessary, so that the net tax benefits are recognized
only to the extent that they will be realized.

The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 as of May 3, 1992 was to increase
net income by $732,000 and has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of
revenue and expense items for tax and financial statement purposes.

Statement of Cash Flows
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Deferred Gain on Lease Transaction
The difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of assets
sold is amortized over the term of the lease. In fiscal 1994, a deferred gain
of $2,734,000 is included in the balance sheet under other long-term
liabilities.

Capitalized Interest
The Company capitalizes interest costs as part of the cost of major asset
construction projects. Capitalized interest was $964,000 in 1994 and $247,000
in 1993. No amounts were capitalized in 1992.

2.  EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
In November 1993, the Company refinanced its long-term debt through the
issuance of $130 million principal amount of 8 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes.
The proceeds, together with borrowings under its new bank credit line, were
used to retire $128.1 million principal amount of 8.60% Senior Notes and
outstanding senior indebtedness under the prior bank credit facility. See Note
4 for further details. The early retirement of the 8.60% Senior Notes and the
outstanding senior indebtedness under the prior bank credit facility resulted
in an extraordinary item of $1.4 million, net of tax benefit of $1.0 million,
associated with the write-off of deferred finance costs.

3.  RESTRUCTURING COSTS
During 1993, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $31,000,000, or, on
an after tax basis, of $19,530,000 or $1.68 per share. This charge was
established to provide for a business reorganization which included facility
closures, relocation of distribution centers into more efficient facilities,
elimination of redundancies between the Company's two principal operating
divisions, workforce reductions and the use of modern technology in warehousing
and transportation.

4.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS

In November 1993, the Company issued $130 million principal amount of 8 7/8%
Senior Subordinated Notes (the "8 7/8% Notes") due November 1, 2003 with
interest payable semiannually commencing May 1, 1994. The 8 7/8% Notes were
sold at a discount for an aggregate price of $128.9 million. Provisions of the
8 7/8% Notes include, without limitation, restrictions of liens, indebtedness,
asset sales, and dividends and other restricted payments. The 8 7/8% Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at 104.44% of
their principal amount beginning November 1998, and thereafter at prices
declining annually to 100% on and after November 2001. In addition, upon the
occurrence of an event that constitutes a Change of Control (as defined in the
indenture for such notes), each holder of the 8 7/8% Notes may require the
Company to repurchase all or a portion of such holder's 8 7/8% Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the repurchase. The 8 7/8%
Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements.

Concurrently with the sale of the 8 7/8% Notes, the Company obtained a $100
million credit line expiring on August 31, 1996 and a $15 million letter of
credit facility expiring on August 31, 1994 from its bank (the "Credit
Facility"). The letter of credit facility was subsequently increased to $20
million of which $4 million was available as of April 30, 1994. Under the
Credit Facility, the credit line is unsecured and bears interest based on the
bank's reference rate, the interbank offshore rate, certificate of deposit rate
or fixed rate at the option of the Company. The provisions of the Credit
Facility include, without limitation, restrictions on secured indebtedness,
asset sales, acquisitions or mergers and dividends. Under the Credit Facility,
the Company is also required to meet certain financial tests which include,
without limitation, those relating to the maintenance of a minimum net worth,
minimum net tangible assets, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum
tangible assets to funded debt ratio and a minimum current ratio (each as
defined in the Credit Facility). In addition to customary provisions relating
to events of default, the Credit Facility provides that an event of default
will occur upon a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture for the 8 7/8%
Notes).

The proceeds from the issuance of the 8 7/8% Notes, together with borrowings
under the Credit Facility, were used to retire $128.1 million principal amount
of 8.60% Senior Notes and outstanding senior indebtedness under the prior bank
credit facility.

Scheduled aggregate annual payments of long-term debt are $299,000 for 1995,
$190,000 for 1996, $21,043,000 for 1997, $47,000 for 1998, $52,000 for 1999 and
$130,919,000 thereafter.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt with
similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt is $144,100,000
as of April 30, 1994.

5.  LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
The Company leases a substantial portion of its operating facilities and
transportation equipment under long-term operating leases. Rental expense under
operating leases for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $19,930,000, $19,661,000 and
$19,413,000, respectively. The approximate minimum future rentals are payable
as follows:

6.  INCOME TAXES
Effective May 3, 1992, the Company adopted "Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109." Refer to Note 1, Accounting Policies, for a discussion of
the effect of adopting this statement. In 1993, a restructuring charge was
recorded. For tax purposes, this charge will become deductible when paid. A
valuation allowance of $657,000 has been recognized to offset the deferred tax
asset.

effective tax rate of 40.5% for fiscal 1994, 37.0% for fiscal 1993 and 40.0%
for fiscal 1992 is due to state taxes, net of the Federal tax benefit and the
effect of the valuation allowance in 1994 and 1993 discussed above.

7.  STOCK OPTION PLANS
The 1988 Stock Option and Compensation Plan (the "1988 Plan") authorizes the
issuance of up to 1,125,000 shares of common stock. The 1988 Plan authorizes
the issuance of various stock incentives to officers and employees, including
options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock, performance
shares and cash awards. Stock options allow for the purchase of common stock at
prices determined by the Stock Option Committee except for incentive stock
options, which must be purchased at prices not less than the fair market value
at the date of grant. These options expire 10 years from the date of grant and
are exercisable as defined by the Stock Option Committee.

Stock appreciation rights (SARs), which may be issued in conjunction with the
grant of options, permit the optionee to receive shares of stock, cash or a
combination of shares and cash measured by the difference between the option
price and the market value of the stock on the date of exercise. Upon exercise
of an SAR, the option is canceled. As of April 30, 1994, there were 39,064 SARs
outstanding.

Restricted stock grants for 42,475 shares, 6,000 shares and 36,500 shares, in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were issued under the 1988 Plan. All of
these shares vest ratably over a four-year period from their respective grant
dates, except that with respect to the fiscal 1994 restricted stock grants,
39,475 shares will vest in full four years from their respective grant dates.
Deferred compensation equivalent to the difference between the market value at
date of grant and the option price was charged to additional paid-in-capital
and is being amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. The
amounts amortized in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $319,000, $394,000 and
$467,000, respectively.

In fiscal 1994 and 1993, the Stock Option Committee awarded converging stock
options of 60,000 and 300,000, respectively, to certain key members of
management under the 1988 Plan at a purchase price of $35 per share. In fiscal
year 1993, 100,000 of these options were canceled and 260,000 options were
outstanding as of April 30, 1994. During the first five years of the options'
ten-year term, the purchase price will be subject to reductions for each year
that the company attains predetermined performance objectives. If the market
price of the Company's common stock and the purchase price of the options
converge during such first five years, the options will become immediately
exercisable in full and the final purchase price will be set at the converging
price for the remainder of the options' term.  If the market price and the
purchase price have not converged by the fifth anniversary of the grant date,
the final purchase price of the options for the remainder of their term will be
established at the purchase price in effect on the fifth anniversary. In such
event, the options shall become exercisable in cumulative installments of 25%
each year commencing on the sixth anniversary of the grant date. With respect
to the 60,000 converging stock options granted in fiscal 1994, for purposes of
determining the purchase price and certain other provisions, these options are
deemed to have the same grant date as the converging stock options granted in
fiscal 1993.

In addition to the 1988 Plan, the Company's 1980 Stock Option Plan (the "1980
Plan") authorized awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights;
options expire 10 years from the date of grant and no further grants may be
made under the 1980 Plan. The Company also maintains the 1993 Director Stock
Option plan (the "1993 Director Plan") and the 1989 Director Stock Option Plan
(the "1989 Director Plan") which authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000 and
50,000 shares of common stock, respectively. Under the 1993 Director Plan, each
director who is not a full-time officer or employee of the Company will receive
annually a non-qualified option to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock. Under
the 1989 Director Plan, each director who is not a full-time officer or
employee of the Company is eligible to receive a non-qualified stock option in
lieu of a portion of such director's compensation for each plan year. Options
under both plans expire 10 years from the date of grant.

During fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, the price range of options and grants
exercised was $1.00 to $16.125 per share and the price of restricted shares
purchased was $1.00 per share. As of April 30, 1994, the exercise price of
options and grants outstanding under all the Company's stock option plans
ranged from $1.00 to $35.00. Changes in the number of shares under all such
stock option plans are summarized as follows:

8.  PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS
The Company maintains non-contributory pension plans for its salaried,
commissioned and certain of its hourly employees. Under the plans, the Company
is required to make annual contributions that are determined by the plans'
consulting actuary, using participant data that is supplied by the Company. It
is the Company's policy to fund pension costs currently. Pension benefits are
based on length of service and either a percentage of final average annual
compensation or a dollar amount for each year of service.

The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation
levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligations were 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively. The expected long-term
rate of return on assets was 10 percent.

A subsidiary has a defined contribution profit sharing plan covering
substantially all of its employees. The charge to operations totaled $456,000,
$1,451,000 and $1,257,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

For collectively bargained, multi-employer pension plans, contributions are
made in accordance with negotiated labor contracts and generally are based on
the number of hours worked. With the passage of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980 (the "Act"), the Company may, under certain
circumstances become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made
under collective bargaining agreements.  Generally, these liabilities are
contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or partial withdrawal from the
plans. The Company has not taken any action to terminate, withdraw or partially
withdraw from these plans which would result in any material liability. Under
the Act, liabilities would be based upon the Company's proportional share of
each plan's unfunded vested benefits which have been estimated by the trustees
of the funds to be approximately $4,200,000. The amount of accumulated benefits
and net assets of such plans is not currently available to the Company. Total
contributions charged to expense under all pension plans were $5,325,000,
$5,583,000 and $5,338,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company maintains an employees' savings and profit sharing plan under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for employees meeting certain age
and service requirements (the "Plan"). In fiscal 1994, the Plan was amended
to provide for a matching contribution by the Company. The Company's
contribution is determined based on established performance objectives and is
made in common stock in an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the
first four percent (4%) of the participant's deferral contributions made during
the Plan year. No matching contribution was made by the Company in fiscal 1994.

9.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company has change in control agreements with various officers which
provide, among other things, that if, within two years after a change in
control (as defined), the Company terminates the employment of the officer,
other than for disability or cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his
employment for good reason (as defined), the officer will receive 2.99 times
the sum of his base salary plus the amount that would otherwise be earned under
any executive compensation plan.

The Company or its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of cases currently
in litigation or potential claims encountered in the normal course of business
which are being vigorously defended. In the opinion of management, the
resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

10.  PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
At April 30, 1994, there were outstanding 11,637,460 rights to purchase Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights were issued as a dividend on
December 18, 1986 and, as a result of the 25 percent stock dividend paid in
January 1989, each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to 0.8 rights.
Each right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company a unit (one
two-hundredth of a share) of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
$.10 par value, at $100 per unit subject to adjustment. The rights are not
exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock until 10 days after a
person or group has acquired 25 percent or more, or makes a tender offer for 30
percent or more, of the Company's common stock. Each right will entitle the
holder, under certain circumstances (a merger, acquisition of 25 percent or
more of common stock of the Company by an acquiring person, self-dealing
transactions by an acquiring person, or sale of 50 percent or more of the
Company's assets or earning power), to acquire, at half the value, either
common stock of the Company, a combination of cash, other property, common
stock or other securities of the Company, or common stock of the acquiring
person. Any such event would also result in any rights owned beneficially by
the acquiring person or its affiliates becoming null and void. The rights
expire December 18, 1996 and are redeemable prior to the time an acquiring
person acquires 25 percent or more of the Company's common stock at one cent
per right. At April 30, 1994, 50,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock were authorized but unissued and were reserved for issuance
upon exercise of the rights.

12.  RESTATEMENT
In September 1991, the Board of Directors approved a settlement of a securities
class action lawsuit filed against the Company and certain officers and
directors in February 1990. The settlement was originally recorded as an
extraordinary item in the second quarter of the Company's financial statements
for the 53 weeks ended May 2, 1992 (fiscal 1992), and reduced income by
$2,610,000, net of the income tax benefit of $1,740,000, or $.23 per share. The
fiscal 1992 financial statements have been restated to include the gross
settlement cost of $4,350,000 as a component of warehouse, selling, general and
administrative expenses. The fiscal 1992 provision for income taxes has also
been restated to reflect the income tax benefit of the litigation settlement.
There were no changes to the fiscal 1992 net income or earnings per share
amounts as a result of this restatement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Rykoff-Sexton, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rykoff-Sexton,
Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994 and May 1,
1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ending
April 30, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Rykoff-Sexton, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of April 30, 1994 and May 1, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended April 30, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for income taxes in 1993.
