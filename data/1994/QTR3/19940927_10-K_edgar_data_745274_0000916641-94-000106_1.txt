                                        PART I
                                  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                     Introduction
          Cadmus  Communications Corporation  ("the Company"  or "Cadmus")  is a
     graphic communications  company which,  through its  subsidiaries, provides
     printing,  marketing, and publishing services.   The Company  is a Virginia
     corporation headquartered at 6620  West Broad Street, Suite  500, Richmond,
     Virginia 23230.
          Cadmus  was formed in 1984  when The William  Byrd Press, Incorporated
     ("Byrd"), a leading regional  publications printer, combined its operations
     with Washburn Graphics, Inc.  ("Washburn"), a vertically integrated graphic
     arts firm.  Byrd, in  operation since 1904, is based in  Richmond, Virginia
     and  Washburn,  in  operation since  1902,  is  based  in Charlotte,  North
     Carolina.
          Since  its  inception in  1984,  Cadmus  has grown  primarily  through
     acquisitions   of  companies   which  either   complement  or   expand  the
     capabilities  the Company offers its  customers.  On  June 30, 1986, Cadmus
     acquired American Graphics, Inc.  ("American"), a full-service graphic arts
     firm  specializing in promotional printing  and the production of point-of-
     sale  advertising materials  which is  based in  Atlanta, Georgia.   Cadmus
     Direct Marketing, Inc. ("CDMI"),  formerly Washburn Direct Marketing, Inc.,
     was  incorporated on  January  1, 1990,  having  previously operated  as  a
     division  of  Washburn.    CDMI  provides  direct  marketing  and  database
     management services.
          During fiscal  year 1988, Cadmus acquired  three additional companies:
     Three  Score,  Inc. ("3  Score"), an  Atlanta,  Georgia company  engaged in
     retail    and   other    direct    mail   catalog    production   services;
     Garamond/Pridemark   Press,  Inc.   ("Garamond"),  located   in  Baltimore,
     Maryland;  and  Vaughan  Printers,  Incorporated  ("Vaughan"),  located  in
     Orlando,  Florida.    Both  Garamond  and  Vaughan are  smaller  commercial
     printing companies specializing in products similar to those at Washburn.
          In  fiscal year  1992, the  Company acquired Tuff  Stuff Publications,
     Inc. ("Tuff Stuff") a  Richmond, Virginia based publisher of  pricing guide
     magazines for various trading  card collectors and other  related products.
     During  fiscal year 1993, the Company completed a joint venture arrangement
     with  The  Lanman Companies,  Inc.  ("Lanman")  whereby  the operations  of
     Vaughan  were combined with  those of Central Florida  Press, a division of
     Lanman.  This new company, Central Florida Press, L.C. ("CFP"),  located in
     Orlando,  Florida, has both sheetfed and half-web print capabilities.  Also
     during  the  year, the  Company  acquired  Marblehead Communications,  Inc.
     ("Marblehead"),  based  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  is  a  contract/custom
     publisher that produces magazines and newsletters.
          During  fiscal year  1994,  the Company  acquired  the net  assets  of
     Waverly Press from Waverly, Inc.  Waverly Press is a Maryland-based premier
     printer  of scientific,  scholarly and  medical  journals and  now operates
     under the name Cadmus Journal Services, Inc ("Cadmus Journal Services").

                                Printing and Marketing

          Printing  and marketing  services account  for approximately  92.5% of
     Cadmus revenues.  Printing operations provide  a full range of services  to
     customers which include state-of-the-art data imaging, electronic prepress,
     multicolor  printing,  custom  binding  and  distribution  services.    The
     following is a list of major printed materials produced  with some examples
     of each:

          Through  our  marketing  services  we  provide  our  clients  complete
     creative,  production,  mailing,  and   fulfillment  services  for   direct
     marketing programs  and marketing  information systems.   Cadmus integrates
     direct  marketing  functions, ranging  from  consumer  market research  and
     agency services to database  management and marketing information analysis,
     with the resulting ability to  implement tactical direct response campaigns
     and  programs for  our  clients.   Cadmus  also provides  turn-key  catalog
     services  from original  design  conception through  the final  product for
     retail  department  stores,  direct  marketing  retailers,  and  industrial
     customers.

                                      Publishing

          Publishing services account for approximately 7.5% of Cadmus revenues.
     There are two major types published products:

          Consumer Products   Tuff  Stuff  publishes special  interest magazines
                              which target specific consumers.   Currently there
                              are four such Cadmus-owned publications:
                                        Tuff Stuff
                                        Tuff Stuff's Collect!
                                        Kenner Guide
                                        Mid-Atlantic Soccer

          Contract Products   Marblehead publishes magazines  for clients  under
                              contract whereby  the client retains  ownership of
                              the  title.    Cadmus  contract  services  include
                              design, editorial,  advertising sales, production,
                              and distribution of titles.

                    Other Factors Affecting the Business of Cadmus

     Seasonal Fluctuations
          Seasonal  fluctuations  occur  in  the overall  demand  for  printing.
     Printing of both periodicals  for the educational and scholarly  market and
     promotional  materials tends  to decline  in  the summer  months.  However,
     consumer  publications tend  to peak  before Christmas  and  before Easter.
     Printing of interim  financial statements  clusters around the  end of  the
     first  month in each calendar quarter and  printing of annual reports tends
     to fall into the first and second calendar quarters.  All  of these factors
     combine  to give Cadmus  a modest seasonal pattern  with the months October
     through  June  producing volumes  slightly  greater  than the  months  July
     through September.

     Raw Materials
          The  principal  raw  material  used  in  Cadmus'  business  is  paper.
     Significant  stock inventories are not maintained except at Byrd and Cadmus
     Journal Services, where a supply of roll paper stock is required to operate
     the web presses.  The other companies generally purchase paper  on a direct
     order basis for  specific jobs.   Cadmus purchases  its paper  requirements
     under  agreements that  guarantee  tonnage and  provide  short range  price
     protection for three to six month intervals.  The price of paper charged to
     customers  is  subject to  escalation so  that,  except in  rare instances,
     Cadmus does not have exposure to changes in the cost of paper.
          All Cadmus subsidiaries use a variety of other raw materials including
     ink,  film,  offset  plates,  chemicals   and  solvents,  glue,  wire,  and
     subcontracted  components.   In  general,  none of  the  subsidiaries  have
     experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials.


<PAGE>



     Competition
          Cadmus is subject  to competition  from a large  number of  companies,
     some  of which have greater resources  and capacity.  In recent years there
     has been an excess of capacity in the printing industry which has increased
     competition.  Rapid technological change has brought new competitors to the
     marketplace.
          The markets served by  Cadmus face competition based on  a combination
     of factors including quality, service levels and price.




<PAGE>



     Employees
          As  of   June  30,   1994,  Cadmus   and  its   subsidiaries  employed
     approximately  2,400  persons.   No employees  are  currently covered  by a
     collective  bargaining agreement.   Cadmus believes  its relationship  with
     employees is excellent.

     Regulation
          The  printing business  uses  or generates  substantial quantities  of
     inks, solvents,  and  other waste  products  which require  disposal.   The
     subsidiaries  usually return salvageable waste  ink to their suppliers, and
     contract for the removal of other waste products.
          Cadmus believes  its subsidiaries  are in substantial  compliance with
     all applicable air quality, waste disposal, and other environmental-related
     rules and  regulations, as well  as with other general  employee health and
     safety laws and regulations.
          The  Virginia  State Air  Pollution  Control Board  (the  "Board") has
     expressed concern about excessive levels of certain air pollutant emissions
     throughout the  metropolitan  Richmond  area  from  a  number  of  sources,
     including  automobiles and local  industries, such as Byrd.   The Board has
     made  no decision whether further  emission reductions will  be required by
     automotive  or industry emissions controls.  Depending on any future action
     by the Board  and in conjunction with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
     several  industries,  including  Byrd, will  be  required  to  take further
     actions  to reduce emission levels,  which may include  the installation of
     additional air pollution control equipment.  The amount of the expenditures
     necessitated by any such actions is not anticipated to be material.
                                   ________________

     Inc. Automated Quotation  System ("NASDAQ")  under the symbol  "CDMS" since
     July  2, 1984  and in  the NASDAQ  National Market  System since  April 16,
     1985.  The stock of Byrd, the predecessor issuer to Cadmus, was also quoted
     in NASDAQ from September 7, 1983, the date of Byrd's first public offering,
     until  June 29,  1984.   Information  with  respect  to  market  prices  is
     presented on page  23 of the  Annual Report and  is incorporated herein  by

     condition,  earnings and  capital requirements  of Cadmus,  and such  other
     factors  as the  Board  of Directors  may  deem relevant.   For  additional

                          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
     Cadmus Communications Corporation:

          We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial statements  of  Cadmus
     Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries  as of June 30, 1994  and 1993,
     and  for each of the three  years in the period ended  June 30, 1994, which
     financial statements are included on pages 24 through 34 of the 1994 Annual
     Report  to   Shareholders   of  Cadmus   Communications   Corporation   and
     incorporated  by  reference herein.   We  have  also audited  the financial
     statement  schedules listed  in the  index on  page 12  of this  Form 10-K.
     These  financial  statements  and  financial statement  schedules  are  the
     responsibility  of the  Company's  management.   Our  responsibility is  to
     express an  opinion on these  financial statements and  financial statement
     schedules based on our audits.

          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards.   Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to
     obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
     of  material misstatement.  An  audit includes examining,  on a test basis,
     evidence  supporting   the  amounts   and  disclosures  in   the  financial
     statements.   An  audit also  includes assessing the  accounting principles
     used  and significant estimates made  by management, as  well as evaluating
     the overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that  our audits
     provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          In our  opinion, the  financial statements  referred to above  present
     fairly, in  all material respects,  the consolidated financial  position of
     Cadmus  Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and
     1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
     for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994 in conformity
     with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.   In  addition,  in  our
     opinion,  the  financial  statement   schedules  referred  to  above,  when
     considered in relation to the basic financial  statements taken as a whole,
     present  fairly, in all material  respects, the information  required to be
     included therein.

          As  discussed  in  Notes  9  and  11  to  the  consolidated  financial
     statements,  effective  as of  the beginning  of  1994, Cadmus  changed its
     method  of accounting  for  income  taxes  to  conform  with  Statement  of
     Financial Accounting Standards  No. 109  and its method  of accounting  for
     postretirement benefits other  than pensions to  conform with Statement  of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.

of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so

Board of Directors.  Members of the Executive Committee who are

officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its

subsidiaries ("Management Members") shall have no vote on matters

involving the nomination of directors.

          The Executive Committee shall fix its own rules of

proceeding and shall meet where and as provided by such rules, but

members present at each meeting.

          The Audit Committee shall report to the Board of

Directors at least once each year, recommending any appropriate

change in operating or accounting practice or in the auditors of

the Corporation and disclosing any acts or practices that are or

may be illegal or contrary to the interests of the Corporation or

to which the attention of the Board should be called for other

reasons, and focusing particularly on the integrity and adequacy

of disclosure of financial information relating to the Corporation

and the identification of any problem areas relating thereto.

          The Chairman of the Board of the Corporation shall

designate an officer of the Corporation to serve as liaison

between the Audit Committee and the officers.  The Audit Committee

or any one or two of its members may interview any employee,

of the inquiry, without the consent of the Audit Committee or the

member or members acting.  The Audit Committee may consult at any

time with counsel regularly retained by the Corporation, and may

at the cost of the Corporation.





                           ARTICLE IV

Vacancies may be filled at any meeting of the Board of Directors.

Any two offices may be combined in the same person as the Board of

Directors may determine.



          Section 2.  Removal of Officers:  Any officer of the

prescribed by the Board of Directors and may (but need not) bear

the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof.  All

certificates shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board or the

President, and also by the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary,

which signatures may be facsimiles thereof.



          Section 2.  Certificates to be Entered:  All

certificates shall be consecutively numbered, and shall contain

the names of the owners, the number of shares and the date of

issue, a record whereof shall be entered in the Corporation's

books.  The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of

record of shares as the legal and equitable owner thereof and

accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other

claim with respect thereto on the part of any other person so far

as the right to vote and to participate in dividends is concerned.



          Section 3.  Transfer of Stock:  The stock of the

Corporation shall be transferable or assignable on the books of

the Corporation by the holders in person or by attorney on

surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares duly

endorsed, and, if sought to be transferred by attorney,

accompanied by a written power of attorney to have the same

transferred on the books of the Corporation.  To the extent that

any provision of the Rights Agreement between the Corporation and

First Union National Bank of North Carolina, N.A., as Rights

Agent, dated as of February 1, 1989, is deemed to constitute a

restriction on the transfer of any securities of the Corporation,

such restriction is hereby authorized by the bylaws of the

Corporation.



          Section 4.  Lost, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates:

The holder of stock of the Corporation shall immediately notify

the Corporation of any loss, destruction, or mutilation of the

certificate therefor, and the Board of Directors may in its

discretion cause one or more new certificates for the same number

of shares in the aggregate to be issued to such stockholder upon

the surrender of the mutilated certificate, or upon satisfactory

proof of such loss or destruction accompanied by the deposit of a

bond in such form and amount and with such surety as the Board of

Directors may require.



          Section 5.  Regulations:  The Board of Directors may

make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient

regulating the issue, transfer and registration of certificates of

stock of the Corporation.





          Section 6.  Determination of Stockholders of Record.

The share transfer books may be closed by order of the Board of

Directors for not more than seventy days for the purpose of

determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any

meeting of the stockholders or any adjournment thereof (or

entitled to receive any distribution or in order to make a

determination of stockholders for any other purpose).  In lieu of

closing such books, the Board of Directors may fix in advance as

the record date for any such determination a date not more than

seventy days before the date on which such meeting is to be held

(or such distribution made or other action requiring such

determination is to be taken).  If the books are not thus closed

or the record date is not thus fixed, the record date shall be the

close of business on the day before the effective date of the

notice to stockholders.



                           ARTICLE VI

                    Miscellaneous Provisions

Directors shall, subject to the laws of the State of Virginia,

have power to determine from time to time whether and to what

extent and under what conditions and limitations the accounts and

books of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the

inspection of the stockholders.



          Section 4.  Contracts, Checks, Notes and Drafts:  All

contracts, checks, notes, drafts, and other orders for the payment

of money shall be signed by such persons as the Board of Directors

from time to time may authorize.



          Section 5.  Amendment of By-Laws:  These By-Laws may be

amended, altered, or repealed by the Board of Directors at any

meeting.  The stockholders shall have the power to rescind, alter,

amend, or repeal any By-Laws and to enact By-Laws which, if so

expressed by the stockholders, may not be rescinded, altered,

amended, or repealed by the Board of Directors.



          Section 6.  Application of the Control Share Acquisition

Act.  Article 14.1 of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 of the Code of

Virginia, consisting of Sections 13.1-728.1 through 13.1-728.9,

shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of the Corporation.

            RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

             CADMUS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

Bylaw Amendment - Change in Director's Principal Occupation


     RESOLVED, that Article II of the Bylaws of the
Corporation shall be amended to add a new Section 7 as

the event that a director changes his principal
occupation, the director shall submit a letter of
resignation to the Chairman of the Board, indicating the
nature of his new principal occupation.  If the new
principal occupation results in a conflict of interest
or otherwise necessitates immediate action, the
Executive Committee shall promptly take such action as
it deems appropriate with respect to the resignation. 
Otherwise, the Executive Committee shall defer action on
the resignation until the expiration of the director's
current term.  At such time, the Executive Committee
shall consider whether to nominate such director for
re-election, taking into consideration the nature of the
director's new occupation, the attributes and
qualifications necessary to maintain a well-balanced
Board, and such other factors as the Executive Committee
deems relevant."

TO THE PURCHASER WHOSE NAME
     APPEARS IN THE ACCEPTANCE
     FORM AT THE END HEREOF

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          The undersigned, CADMUS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, a
Virginia corporation (the "Company"), hereby agrees with you as
follows:

          SECTION 1.  ISSUANCE OF NOTES.

          SECTION 1.  Authorization.  The Company has duly
authorized an issue of $40,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
its 6.74% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2003 (the "Notes").  Each
such note shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A.  As
used herein, the term "Notes" includes all notes originally issued
pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements referred to in
Section 2.19 and all notes delivered in substitution or exchange
for any of said notes pursuant to this Agreement and said other
agreements and, where applicable, shall include the singular
number as well as the plural.  The term "Note" shall mean one of
the Notes.

          SECTION 2.  Purchase and Sale of Notes the Closing. 
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company will sell
to you and you agree to purchase from the Company Notes in the
aggregate principal amount set forth opposite your name in
Schedule I, at a purchase price equal to 100% of such principal
amount.  The closing of such purchase shall be held on
December 23, 1993 or on such later Business Day as may be agreed
upon by the Company and you (the "Closing Date"), at the offices
of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, 153 East 53rd Street, New York, New
York 10022.  On the Closing Date the Company will deliver to you
one or more Notes, registered in your name or in the name of your
nominee, in any denominations (multiples of $500,000) and in the
aggregate principal amount to be purchased by you, all as you may
specify by timely notice to the Company (or, in the absence of
such notice, one Note registered in your name), duly executed and
dated the Closing Date, against your delivery to the Company of
immediately available funds in the amount of the purchase price of
such Note or Notes, such delivery to be by wire transfer to the 
Company's Account No. 6260-050146 at Wachovia Bank of North
Carolina, N.A. (ABA No. 053100494).

          SECTION 2.  REPRESENTATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  The Company
represents and warrants to you as follows:

          SECTION 1.  Organization, Authorization, Etc.  The
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and
has all requisite power and authority to own or hold under lease
the property it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact
the business it transacts, to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof.
The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the
business transacted by it requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not individually or in
the aggregate materially affect adversely the financial condition,
business or properties of the Company or the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the Company.  This Agreement is, and the
Notes when delivered hereunder will be, legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of other
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          SECTION 2.  Business, Properties and Other Information.
The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and has delivered to
you copies of:

          A.   its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year
     ended June 30, 1993 (the "1993 Annual Report"), filed
     pursuant to Section 13(a) of said Act;

          B.   its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its fiscal
     quarter ended September 30, 1993, filed pursuant to Section
     13(a) of said Act;

          C.   the Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of
     Stockholders on November 10, 1993, filed pursuant to Section
     14 of said Act; and

          D.   a Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 10,
     1993, filed pursuant to Section 13(a) of said Act.


Said reports and proxy statement comprise all reports and proxy
statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission
since June 30, 1993 and are collectively called the "SEC Reports",
which term shall also include on the Closing Date all further
reports and proxy statements which the Company may theretofore
have furnished to you pursuant to Section 6D.

          The Company has also delivered to you a copy of a
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated October 4, 1993,
prepared by Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A. (the
"Memorandum"), relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

          As of their respective dates none of the SEC Reports,
nor this Agreement, the Memorandum or any other document, slide
presentation, certificate or written statement furnished to you by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection
herewith, or any statement made by officers or other
representatives of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection
herewith in due diligence meetings held on October 28 and 29,
1993, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained herein and therein not misleading.  Since June 30, 1993
there has been no material change in the business, operations,
properties, prospects or condition (financial or other) of the
Company or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
except for changes, which are not adverse, resulting from the
acquisition in November 1993 of the assets of the printing
division of Waverly, Inc. (the "Waverly Acquisition"). The Company
knows of no fact (other than matters of a general economic nature)
which individually or in the aggregate materially affect adversely
or, so far as the Company can now foresee, will materially affect
adversely the business, operations, properties, prospects or
condition (financial or other) of the Company or the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Notes or the
ability of any Subsidiary to perform its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guaranty.

          SECTION 3.  Incorporation Good Standing and Ownership
of Subsidiaries.  Exhibit 2.3 is a complete and correct list of
each of the Subsidiaries showing, as to each Subsidiary, the
correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization, the
percentage of shares of each class of securities of such
Subsidiary owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary and
whether such Subsidiary is a Material Subsidiary.

          All of the outstanding shares of each of the
Subsidiaries shown in Exhibit 2.3 as being owned by the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another subsidiary
free and clear of any Lien.  No Subsidiary owns any shares of the
Company.


          Each subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or
nature of the business transacted by it requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified
individually and in the aggregate would not materially affect
adversely the financial condition, business or properties of the
Company or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Each
Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to own or hold
under lease the property it purports to own or hold under lease
and to transact the business it transacts.

          SECTION 4.  Financial Statements.  The Company has
delivered to you copies of:

          A.   the consolidated balance sheets of the Company and
     its Subsidiaries as at June 30, 1991, 1992 and 1993 and the
     related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
     equity and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
     each of the fiscal years then ended, all with reports thereon
     of Coopers & Lybrand, independent public accountants; and

          B.   the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and the
     related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash
     flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the three
     months then ended, all certified by the chief financial
     officer of the Company.

All such financial statements (including any related schedules or
notes) are complete and correct and present fairly in all material
respects the financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates of such consolidated
balance sheets and the results of their operations for the fiscal
periods ended on said dates (subject, in the case of such
unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end and audit
adjustments).  Since June 30, 1993, there have been no changes in
the assets, liabilities or financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries from that set forth in said consolidated balance
sheet as of said date, other than the Waverly Acquisition and
changes which have not, either individually or in the aggregate,
been materially adverse to the Company or the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          SECTION 5.  Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments,
Etc.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Notes will not (A) contravene, result in any
breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
creation of any Lien in respect of any property of the Company or
any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, bank
loan or credit agreement, corporate charter or by-laws, or any
other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of their respective properties may be bound or affected,
(B) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Order of any court, arbitrator or
Governmental Body applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or
(C) violate any provision of any statute or any rule or regulation
of any Governmental Body applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary.

          As used in this Agreement, the term "Governmental Body"
includes any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign, exercising executive, legislative, judicial,
regulatory or administrative functions of or pertaining to any
government; and the term "Order" includes any order, writ,
injunction, decree, judgment, award, determination, direction or
demand.

          SECTION 6.  No Defaults Under Existing Debt.  Exhibit
2.6 is a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the
Company and each Subsidiary, showing as to each item exceeding
$250,000 the obligee, the aggregate principal amount outstanding
and the final maturity date and a brief description of any
security therefor.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
default (whether or not waived) in the performance or observance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions contained in any
instrument evidencing any Debt and no event has occurred and is
continuing which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would
become such a default.

          SECTION 7.  Governmental Authorizations, Etc.  No
consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing, or
declaration with, any Governmental Body is required for the
validity of the execution and delivery or for the performance by
the Company of this Agreement or the Notes or by any Subsidiary of
its Subsidiary Guaranty.

          SECTION 8.  Litigation; Observance of Statutes,
Regulations and Orders.  There are no actions, suits or
proceedings (including counterclaims) pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
Subsidiary or any property of the Company or any Subsidiary in any
court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
Governmental Body, except actions, suits or proceedings which (i)
individually do not represent a potential claim in excess of
$1,000,000 and (ii) in the aggregate, if adversely determined,
would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, properties, prospects or condition (financial or
other) of the Company or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.

          Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default
under any Order of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Body or
is in violation of any statute or other rule or regulation of any 
Governmental Body, except for possible defaults or violations
which would not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, properties, prospects or condition
(financial or other) of the Company or the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Notes or of
any Subsidiary to perform its obligations under its Subsidiary
Guaranty.

          SECTION 9.  Taxes.  The Company and each Subsidiary have
filed all tax returns or obtained extensions in all jurisdictions
in which such returns or extensions are required to have been
filed by them and have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable
on such returns and all other taxes and assessments payable by
them, in each case to the extent the same have become due and
payable and before they have become delinquent, except for any
taxes and assessments the amount, applicability or validity of
which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, has made provision in respect of
such liability in accordance with GAAP.  The federal income tax
liabilities of the Company have been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service and paid for all tax years up to and including the
tax year ended June 30, 1991.

          SECTION 10.  Title to Properties.  Each of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to its
respective real properties and good title to its other properties
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as at June 30, 1993
described in Section 2.4A or purported to have been acquired by
the Company or any Subsidiary after said date (other than
properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of
business), subject to no Lien of any kind except Liens permitted
(without any requirement of securing the Notes) by Section 8.5. 
The Company and its Subsidiaries enjoy such possession under all
material leases as is necessary for the use and operation of their
respective properties, none of which contains any unusual or
burdensome provisions which individually or in the aggregate might
materially affect or impair such use or operation.  All such
material leases are valid, subsisting and in full force and effect.

          SECTION 11.  Licenses, Permits, Etc.  The Company and
its Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises,
authorizations, patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names,
or rights thereto, material to the conduct of their respective
businesses as now conducted, without known conflict with the
rights of others, and there are no agreements providing for the
expiration or termination of any of the same prior to the final
maturity of the Notes.

          SECTION 12.  Compliance with ERISA.  Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred (A) any "accumulated funding
deficiency" or "waived funding deficiency" within the 
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Sections 302 and 303(c) of
ERISA, or (B) any liability to the PBGC in connect ion with any
ERISA Plan established or maintained by it (other than for the
payment of premiums, although no such premiums are now due and
payable); nor has the Company or any ERISA Affiliate had any
penalty or tax assessed against it by the Department of Labor or
the Internal Revenue Service for any alleged violation under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.  The current
value of the benefit liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)
(16) of ERISA) of each ERISA Plan, other than a Multiemployer
Plan, does not exceed the fair market value of the assets of such
ERISA Plan as of the most recently ended plan year of each such
ERISA Plan.  Full payment has been made of all amounts which are
required under the terms of each ERISA Plan to have been paid as
contributions to such ERISA Plan as of the last day of the most
recent plan year of such ERISA Plan.  Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has made a complete or partial withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan which has resulted in a present or potential
unsatisfied withdrawal liability obligation to such Plan which is
not reflected in the Company's most recent financial statements
referred to in Section 2.4B.  Except as disclosed in the 1993
Annual Report, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
provides medical benefits to retirees or to their beneficiaries
other than as mandated under Section 4980B of the Code or Section
601 et seq. of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any liability in respect of any medical benefits
payable to retirees or their beneficiaries.  The transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not involve a prohibited
transaction (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 406(a) of ERISA) that could subject the Company or any
holder of a Note to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed under said Section 4975 of the Code or by Section 502(i)
of ERISA.  The representation by the Company in the preceding
sentence is made in reliance upon your representation in Section
3.2 and the representations of the other purchasers in Section 3.2
of the other agreements referred to in Section 2.19.

          SECTION 13.  Private Offering.  Neither the Company nor,
to the knowledge of the Company, anyone acting on its behalf has
offered the Notes, any Subsidiary Guaranty or any similar
securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the
same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect
thereof with, any person other than you, the other purchasers
listed in Schedule I and not more than 25 other institutional
investors.  Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any
action which would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes or
the execution and delivery of any Subsidiary Guaranty to Section 5
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

          SECTION 14.  Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations.  The
Company will apply approximately $35,500,000 of the proceeds of
the sale of the Notes to repay Debt of the Company (including
approximately $15,500,000 of Debt incurred to fund the Waverly 
Acquisition); and the balance of such proceeds will be used to pay
the remaining portion of the purchase price for the Waverly
Acquisition and for general corporate purposes.  No part of the
proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, and no
part of the proceeds of such Debt was used, directly or
indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock
within the meaning of Regulation G of the Board of Governors of
the United States Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 207), or for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying or trading in any securities
under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation
of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any
broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12
CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more than 25% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company agrees
that margin stock will not at any time constitute more than 25% of
such assets.  As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock"
and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the aforesaid Regulation G.

          SECTION 15.  Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Etc. 
Neither the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use
of the proceeds thereof will result in a violation of any of the
foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury
Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended), or any
ruling issued thereunder or any enabling legislation or
Presidential Executive Order in connection therewith.

          SECTION 16.  Investment Company Act and Holding Company
Status.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
"holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or a "public
utility", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled"
by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, or an "investment adviser" within
the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

          SECTION 17.  Solvency.  The Company is, and upon giving
effect to the issuance of the Notes on the Closing Date will be, a
"solvent institution", as that term is used in Section 1405(c) of the
Insurance Law of the State of New York, whose "obligations . . .
are not in default as to principal or interest", as those terms
are used in said Section 1405(c).

          SECTION 18.  Environmental Matters.  The Company has
obtained all environmental, health and safety Governmental
Approvals required under all applicable Environmental Laws to
carry on its business as now conducted.  Each such Governmental
Approval so obtained is in full force and effect and the Company
is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
conditions thereof.  The Company is also in compliance in all
material respects with all other limitations, restrictions, 
conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations,
schedules and timetables contained in any applicable Environmental
Law or in any regulation, code, plan or Order issued, entered,
promulgated or approved thereunder.

          In addition, except as set forth on Exhibit 2.18:

          A.   no written notice, notification, demand, request
     for information, citation, summons or order has been received
     by, no complaint has been served on, and no penalty has been
     assessed against the Company or any Subsidiary and no
     investigation or review is pending, or to the knowledge of
     the Company threatened, by any Governmental Body or other
     entity with respect to any alleged failure by the Company or
     any Subsidiary to have any environmental, health or safety
     Governmental Approval required under any Environmental Law or
     with respect to any generation, treatment, storage,
     recycling, transportation, discharge or disposal, or any
     Release of any Hazardous Materials;

          B.   neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns or
     operates a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal
     facility requiring a permit under the Resource Conservation
     and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq., as amended, or
     under any comparable state or local statute;

          C.   with respect to properties owned, leased, or
     operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries,

               (1)  no polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCB's") are
          present at any property owned or leased by the Company
          or any Subsidiary,

               (2)  no asbestos or asbestos-containing material is
          present at any property owned or leased by the Company
          or any Subsidiary,

               (3)  there are no underground storage tanks or
          surface impoundments for Hazardous Materials, active or
          abandoned, at any property owned or leased by the
          Company or any Subsidiary,

               (4)  no Release of Hazardous Materials has occurred
          at, on or under any property while owned, leased or
          operated by the Company or any Subsidiary, and

               (5)  no Lien pursuant to any Environmental Law has
          been threatened or filed against any property owned,
          leased or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary;

          D.   neither the Company nor or any Subsidiary has
     transported or arranged for the transportation of any
     Hazardous Material to any location that is listed on the
     National Priorities List under CERCLA or on any similar state 
     or local list or that is the subject of Federal, state or
     local enforcement actions or other investigations that may
     lead to Environmental Claims against the Company or any
     Subsidiary; and

          E.   neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received
     any notice from any Governmental Body or third person that
     the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to an Environmental
     Law is or may be liable or a potentially responsible party
     for the costs of removal, remedial or other actions incurred
     by others in response to the Release or threatened Release of
     a Hazardous Material.

          SECTION 19.  Other Agreements.  Simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, the Company is entering into other
agreements identical in all respects with this Agreement (except
the principal amount of Notes to be purchased) with the other
purchasers named in Schedule I.  The aggregate principal amount of
Notes to be purchased by you and said other purchasers under this
Agreement and said other agreements is $40,000,000, but the
purchases by you and said other purchasers are to be separate and
several transactions.

          SECTION 3.  REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASER.  You
represent to the Company as follows:

          SECTION 1.  Purchase of Notes.  On the Closing Date you
will acquire the Notes being purchased by you without a view to
the distribution thereof, provided that the disposition of your
property shall at all times be within your control.

          SECTION 2.  Source of Funds.  Either:

          A.   no part of the funds used by you to purchase Notes
     hereunder will be from the assets of any separate account
     maintained by you in which any ERISA Plan (or its related
     trust) has an interest; or

          B.   if any part of such purchase will be from the
     assets of any separate account maintained by you in which any
     ERISA Plan has an interest,

               (1)  on or prior to the Closing Date you shall have
          disclosed to the Company in writing the name of each
          ERISA Plan the assets of which are in such separate
          account, or

               (2)  such separate account is a "pooled separate
          account" entitled to the exemptions granted by the
          Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 90-1 issued by
          the Department of Labor and on or prior to the Closing
          Date you shall have disclosed to the Company in writing
          the name of each ERISA Plan whose assets in such 
          separate account exceed or are expected to exceed 10% of
          the total assets of such account as of the Closing Date.

For purposes of clause (2) above all ERISA Plans maintained by the
same employer or employee organization are deemed to be a single
ERISA Plan.  As used in this Section 3.2, the term "separate
account" shall have the meaning assigned to it in Section 3(17) of
ERISA.

          SECTION 4.  CONDITIONS OF CLOSING.  Your obligation to
purchase and pay for the Notes to be purchased by you hereunder is

          SECTION 6.  Private Placement Number.  The Notes shall

final maturity thereof, the Company will make mandatory
prepayments in respect of the Notes and may make optional

          SECTION 1.  Mandatory Prepayments of Notes.  On December

principal amounts of Notes set forth below (or, if less, the
unpaid balance thereof):

                                               Mandatory
          Date                             Prepayment Amount

in each case at the principal amount so to be prepaid, together
with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment,
without premium, and allocated as provided in Section 5.4.  No
prepayment of less than all the Notes pursuant to Section 5.2
shall relieve the Company of its obligation to make the
prepayments of Notes required by this Section 5.1.


          SECTION 2.  Optional Prepayment of Notes.  Upon notice
given as provided in Section 5.3, the Company may at any time
prepay the Notes as a whole, or from time to time in part (in a
minimum amount of $2,500,000 and otherwise in multiples of
$500,000), in each case at the principal amount so to be prepaid,
together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for such
prepayment, plus a premium in an amount equal to the Make-Whole
Amount for each such Note.

          SECTION 3.  Notice of Prepayment; Make-Whole
Computations. The Company shall call Notes for prepayment pursuant to Section
5.2 by giving written notice thereof to each holder of the Notes,
which notice shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the date fixed for such prepayment, shall specify the
amount so to be prepaid and the date fixed for such prepayment and
shall also identify the Computing Holder in respect of such
prepayment.  Notice of prepayment having been so given, the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so to be prepaid as
specified in such notice, together with interest accrued thereon
to the date of such prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount, if
any, with respect to each such Note, shall become due and payable
on the specified prepayment date.

          The Make-Whole Amount to be paid in connection with any
prepayment of Notes pursuant to Section 5.2 shall be determined by
the Computing Holder in respect of such prepayment and written
notice of the amount thereof shall be furnished to the Company by
such Computing Holder at least four Business Days prior to the
date fixed for such prepayment, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the computation thereof and the assumptions made
in connection therewith (including a copy of the Telerate screen
or other source of market data used to determine the Treasury
Yield), provided that such Computing Holder shall incur no
liability to the Company, any other holder of Notes or any other
Person in connection with its making of, or failure to make, such
determination.  The Company shall deliver to each other holder of
the Notes a copy of such notice not later than two Business Days
after the Company's receipt thereof.  If the Computing Holder
shall fail to make such determination, then the Company shall do
so and shall prepare and furnish such written notice of the amount
thereof to each holder of the Notes not later than two Business
Days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment.

          SECTION 4.  Allocation of Partial Prepayments.  In the
event of any prepayment of less than all of the outstanding Notes
pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, the Company will allocate
the principal amount so to be prepaid among all outstanding Notes
in proportion to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof.

          SECTION 5.  Surrender of Notes; Notation Thereon. 
Subject to the provisions of Section 14, the Company may, as a
condition of payment on account of any Note, require the holder of
such Note to present such Note for notation of such payment and,
if such Note be paid in full, require the surrender thereof.


          SECTION 6.  Purchase of Notes.  The Company will not,
and will not permit any Subsidiary or Affiliate to, acquire
directly or indirectly by purchase or prepayment or otherwise any
of the outstanding Notes except by way of payment or prepayment in
accordance with the provisions of the Notes and of this Agreement.

          SECTION 6.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION.  The
Company will furnish to you, so long as you shall be obligated to

a Note, in duplicate if requested:

     each case within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA; and


          I.   such other information, including financial
     statements and computations, relating to the performance of
     the provisions of this Agreement and the affairs of the
     Company and any of its Subsidiaries as you or any such holder
     may from time to time reasonably request.

          The Company will keep at its principal executive office,
     a true copy of this Agreement (as at the time in effect), and
     cause the same to be available for inspection at said office
     during normal business hours by any holder of a Note or any
     prospective transferee of a Note designated by a holder
     thereof.

     SECTION 7.  INSPECTION OF PROPERTIES AND BOOKS.  You (for so
long as you shall be obligated to purchase or shall hold Notes)
and each other holder of a Note shall have the right to visit and
inspect any of the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to examine their books of account and records and
make or be provided with copies and extracts therefrom, to discuss
their affairs, finances and accounts with, and to be advised as to
the same by, their officers and independent public accountants
(and by this provision the Company authorizes such accountants to
discuss such affairs, finances and accounts, whether or not a
representative of the Company is present), all at such reasonable
times and to such reasonable extent as you or such other holder
may desire.  The Company agrees to pay all out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by you and each such other holder in connection with your
and such other holder's exercise of rights pursuant to this
Section 7 at any time when a Default or an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing.

          SECTION 8.  COVENANTS.  The Company covenants and agrees
that so long as any Note shall be outstanding:

          SECTION 1.  Payment of Principal, Interest and Premium.
The Company will duly and punctually pay the principal of, and
interest and premium (if any) on, the Notes in accordance with the
terms of the Notes and this Agreement.

          SECTION 2.  Keep Books; Reserves; Corporate Existence,
Payment of Taxes; Maintenance of Properties; Compliance with Laws;
Insurance.  The Company will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to,

          A.   keep proper books of record and account, and keep
     reserves, all in accordance with GAAP;

          B.   subject to Section 8.9, do or cause to be done all
     things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and
     effect its corporate existence, material rights (charter and
     statutory) and franchises, provided that the Company shall
     not be required to preserve any right or franchise of the
     Company, and no Subsidiary shall be required to preserve its
     corporate existence or any right or franchise of such 
     Subsidiary, if the Board of Directors shall determine that
     the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the
     conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
     thereof would not have a material adverse effect on the
     business, operations, properties, prospects or condition
     (financial or other) of the Company or of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

          C.   pay and discharge or cause to be paid and
     discharged all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
     levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or upon
     any of its property, real, personal or mixed, or upon any
     part thereof, when due, as well as all lawful claims for
     labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law
     become a Lien upon its property, provided that neither the
     Company nor any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any such
     tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim if the amount,
     applicability or validity thereof shall be contested on a
     timely basis in good faith by appropriate proceedings (so
     long as the enforcement of any Lien arising out of such
     nonpayment shall be stayed during the proceedings) and if
     appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required by GAAP
     shall have been made therefor;

          D.   maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and
     kept, its properties in good repair, working order and
     condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the
     business carried on in connection therewith may be properly
     and advantageously conducted at all times, provided that
     nothing in this Subsection shall prevent the Company or any
     of its Subsidiaries from discontinuing the operation and the
     maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance
     is, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, desirable in
     the conduct of its business and would not have a material
     adverse effect on the business, operations, properties,
     prospects or condition (financial or other) of the Company or
     of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

          E.   obtain, comply in all material respects with,
     preserve and keep in full force and effect all licenses,
     permits, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental
     Bodies individually or in the aggregate material to the
     conduct of its business and its ownership of properties and
     comply in all material respects with all applicable statutes,
     regulations and Orders of, and all applicable restrictions
     imposed by, any Governmental Body, in respect of the conduct
     of its business and the ownership of its properties
     (including without limitation applicable Environmental Laws
     and statutes, regulations and Orders relating to equal
     employment opportunities);

          F.   without limiting the generality of Subsection E
     above, conduct and complete all investigations, studies,
     sampling and testing, and all remedial, removal and other 
     actions, required under Environmental Laws and promptly
     comply with all Orders and lawful directives of all
     Governmental Bodies respecting Environmental Laws, except to
     the extent that the same are being contested in good faith by
     appropriate proceedings and the pendency of such proceedings
     would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
     operations, properties, prospects or condition (financial or
     other) of the Company or of the Company and its Subsidiaries
     taken as a whole; and

          G.   insure and keep insured with financially sound and
     reputable insurers so much of their respective properties,
     and such insurance shall be in such amounts (and with such
     deductibles), as companies engaged in a similar business in
     accordance with good business practice customarily insure
     properties of a similar character against loss by fire and
     from other causes; and maintain with financially sound and
     reputable insurers public liability insurance against claims
     for personal injury, death or property damage suffered by
     others upon or in or about any premises occupied by it or
     occurring as a result of its ownership, maintenance or
     operations of any automobiles, railroad cars, trucks or other
     vehicles, aircraft or other facilities or as a result of the
     use of products manufactured, constructed or sold by it or
     services rendered by it, in such amounts (and with such
     deductibles) as such insurance is usually carried by
     companies engaged in a similar business and as is in
     accordance with good business practice.

          SECTION 3.  Compliance with ERISA.  The Company will
not, and will not permit any ERISA Affiliate to, (A) engage in any
transaction in connection with which the Company or such
Subsidiary could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section
4975 of the Code, (B) terminate or withdraw from any ERISA Plan,
including a Multiemployer Plan, in a manner, or take any other
action with respect to any such ERISA Plan (including without
limitation a substantial cessation of operations within the
meaning of Section 4062(e) of ERISA), which could result in any
liability of the Company or such Subsidiary to a Multiemployer
Plan, to the PBGC or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042(b)
of ERISA, (C) incur any liability to the PBGC on account of a
termination of an ERISA Plan under Section 4064 of ERISA, (D) fail
to make full payment when due of all amounts which, under the
provisions of any ERISA Plan, applicable law or applicable
collective bargaining agreement, the Company or any such
Subsidiary is required to pay as contributions thereto, (E) permit
to exist any accumulated funding deficiency, within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Sections 302 and 303(c) of ERISA,
whether or not waived, with respect to any ERISA Plan (other than
a Multiemployer Plan), (F) except as disclosed in the 1993 Annual
Report, create or suffer to exist any unfunded expected post
retirement benefit obligation (determined in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without 
taking into account liabilities attributable to coverage mandated
under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (G) adopt any amendment to
any ERISA Plan which would require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide security to such ERISA Plan under Section
307 of ERISA or Section 401(a) (29) of the Code, if, in any such
case, such penalty or tax or such liability, or the failure to
make such payment, or the existence of such deficiency, as the
case may be, could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, properties or
condition (financial or other) of the Company or the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          SECTION 4.  Limitations on Debt.  The Company will not,
and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or
otherwise be liable with respect to any Debt except:

          A.  the Notes and the Subsidiary Guaranties;

          B.  Debt existing on the date of this Agreement and
     described in Exhibit 2.6 (after giving effect to the issuance
     of Notes on the Closing Date and the application of the
     proceeds thereof as provided in Section 2.14); and

          C.  other Debt, provided that immediately after giving
     effect to the incurrence of such Debt, (l) Consolidated Debt
     would not exceed the following applicable percentage of
     Consolidated Total Capitalization at the time of incurrence
     thereof: (i) 65%, during the period from the Closing Date
     through December 31, 1994; (ii) 60%, during the period from
     January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996; and (iii) 55%
     thereafter, and (2) in the case of Debt of a Subsidiary, the
     Company would be permitted to incur at least $1 of additional
     secured Debt under Section 8.5I.

For purposes of this Section 8.4 any Debt of a Person outstanding
at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary or is acquired,
consolidated or merged with or into the Company or a Subsidiary
shall be deemed to have been incurred at that time.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
8.4, the Company covenants and agrees that the covenants and
events of default (and related definitions) contained in the
credit facility or facilities to be entered into by the Company
with Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A. and one or more other
banks (a draft of which has been delivered to you) will not be
more favorable to such banks in any material respect than the
covenants and events of default (and related definitions)
contained in this Agreement.

          SECTION 5.  Limitation on Liens.  The Company will not,
and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, create, assume,
incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with respect to any
property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, 
without making effective provision, and the Company covenants that
in any such case it will make or cause to be made provision
(pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to
the Required Holders in their sole discretion as evidenced by
their prior written approval of such documentation) whereby the
Notes shall be secured by such Lien equally and rat ably with or
prior to any and all other obligations and Debt to be secured
thereby; provided that nothing contained in this Section 8.5 shall
prohibit:

          A.  Liens on property of the Company or any Subsidiary
     existing on the Closing Date and described in Exhibit 2.6;

          B.  Any extension, renewal or replacement of any Lien
     permitted by Subsection A above but only if the principal
     amount of Debt secured thereby is not increased and such Lien
     does not extend to or cover any other property;

          C.  Liens in respect of equipment or real property
     acquired or improvements constructed on real property by the
     Company or a Subsidiary after the Closing Date, which Liens
     are created at the time of acquisition or completion of
     construction of such property or within 270 days thereafter,
     to secure Debt assumed or incurred to finance all or any part
     of the purchase price or cost of construction of such
     property, or in the case of any Person that hereafter becomes
     a Subsidiary or is consolidated with or merged with or into
     the Company or a Subsidiary or sells, leases or otherwise
     disposes of all or substantially all of its property to the
     Company or a Subsidiary, Liens existing at the time such
     Person becomes a Subsidiary or is so consolidated or merged
     or effects such sale, lease or other disposition of property
     (and not incurred in anticipation thereof), or in the case of
     any property acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after
     the Closing Date, Liens existing on such property at the time
     of acquisition thereof (and not incurred in anticipation
     thereof), whether or not the Debt secured thereby is assumed
     by the Company or a Subsidiary, provided that in any such case

               (1)  no such Lien shall extend to or cover any
          other property of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
          case may be, and

               (2)  the aggregate principal amount of the Debt
          secured by all such Liens in respect of any such
          property shall not exceed the lesser of the cost and the
          fair market value of such property at the time of such
          acquisition (or in the case of Debt incurred to finance
          improvements the fair market value at the time of
          completion of construction) or, in the case of a Lien in
          respect of property existing at the time of such Person
          becoming a Subsidiary or being so consolidated or merged 
          or effecting such sale, lease or other disposition, the
          fair market value of such property at such time;

          D.  Liens for taxes or assessments or other governmental
     charges or levies, either not yet due and payable or to the
     extent that nonpayment thereof shall be permitted by the
     proviso to Section 8.2C;

          E.  Liens granted by one Subsidiary to a Wholly-owned
     Subsidiary or by a Subsidiary to the Company;

          F.  Liens incurred or deposits made in the ordinary
     course of business in connection with workers' compensation,
     unemployment insurance and other types of social security or
     to secure the performance of tenders, statutory obligations,
     surety and appeal bonds, bids, leases, government contracts,
     performances and return of money bonds and similar
     obligations;

          G.  Liens incidental to the normal conduct of the
     business of the Company or any Subsidiary or the ownership of
     its property (including without limitation minor survey
     exceptions, title defects, minor encumbrances, easements,
     reservations, rights of others for rights-of-way, zoning or
     other restrictions as to the use of real property), which are
     not incurred in connection with the incurrence of Debt and
     which do not in the aggregate materially impair the use of
     such property in the operation of the business of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the value of such
     property for the purpose of such business;

          H.  Liens of or resulting from any judgment rendered by
     a court of competent jurisdiction (other than judgments and
     awards which if not discharged would result in a Default
     under Section 10.1J), the appeal of which the Company or a
     Subsidiary is prosecuting in good faith; and

          I.  Liens which would otherwise not be permitted by
     Subsections A through H above, securing Debt of the Company
     or a Subsidiary then permitted to be incurred pursuant to
     Section 8.4C, provided that after giving effect thereto the
     sum (without duplication) of (l) the aggregate unpaid
     principal amount of Debt of the Company secured by such Liens
     permitted by this Subsection, (2) the aggregate unpaid
     principal amount of Debt of all Subsidiaries (other than (i)
     Debt permitted by Sections 8.4A and 8.4B, (ii) Debt owing to
     the Company or any Wholly-owned Subsidiary and (iii)
     unsecured Debt as to which the Company has complied with the
     requirements set forth in Section 8.11D) and (3) the
     aggregate Attributable Debt in connection with all sale and
     leaseback transactions of the Company and its Subsidiaries
     permitted by Section 8.8, does not exceed 15% of Consolidated
     Net Worth.


     For purposes of this Section 8.5 any Lien existing in respect
     of property at the time such property is acquired or in
     respect of property of a Person at the time such Person is
     acquired, consolidated or merged-with or into the Company or
     a Subsidiary shall be deemed to have been created at that
     time.

          SECTION 6.  Maintenance of Financial Conditions.  The
Company will not permit

          A.  Consolidated Net Worth at any time to be less than
     the sum of (l) $40,000,000 plus (2) 50% of Consolidated Net
     Income on a cumulative basis for each fiscal quarter
     (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 1993)
     for which Consolidated Net Income is positive, or

          B.  Consolidated Income Available for Fixed Charges for
     any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (commencing
     with the period ending on December 31, 1993) to be less than
     350% of Fixed Charges for such period.

          SECTION 7.  Limitation on Restricted Payments and
Restricted Investments.  The Company will not, and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make or
declare any Restricted Payment or make any Restricted Investment
unless after giving effect to any such action

          A.  the aggregate of all (1) Restricted Payments made
     during the period commencing on July l, 1993 and ending on
     and including the last day of the fiscal quarter then
     preceding the date of such action (the "Computation Period")
     and (2) Restricted Investments existing on the date of such
     action, shall not exceed

               (a)  $2,000,000 plus 50% (or minus 100% in the case
          of a deficit) of Consolidated Net Income for the
          Computation Period, plus

               (b)  the aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company
          from the issuance of shares of capital stock of any
          class of the Company (other than shares of Preferred
          Stock constituting Debt hereunder) during the
          Computation Period; and

          B.  after giving effect to such proposed Restricted
     Payment or Restricted Investment, (l) no Default or Event of
     Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (2) the
     Company would be permitted to incur at least $1 of additional
     Debt under Section 8.4C.

          The Company will not declare any dividend on any of its
shares payable more than 90 days after the declaration date.


          SECTION 8.  Sale and Leaseback Transactions.  The
Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of (collectively, a
"transfer") any asset on terms whereby the asset or a
substantially similar asset is or may be leased or reacquired by
the Company or any Subsidiary, unless the Company or such
Subsidiary would be entitled to incur additional secured Debt
pursuant to Section 8.5I in an amount equal to the Attributable
Debt with respect to such transaction without equally and ratably
securing the Notes.

          SECTION 9.  Consolidation, Merger or Disposition of
Assets as an Entirety.  The Company will not, and will not permit
any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consolidate or merge
with, or sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of its
assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to, any
Person (other than as permitted by Section 8.10D), except that,
subject to the last paragraph of this Section,

          A.  a Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge into or
     sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of its
     assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the
     Company or to a Wholly-owned Subsidiary or to a Person which
     thereupon becomes a Wholly-owned Subsidiary, and

          B.  the Company may permit any Person to be merged into
     the Company or may consolidate with or merge into or sell or
     otherwise (except by lease) dispose of its assets as an
     entirety or substantially as an entirety to any solvent
     corporation organized under the laws of the United States of
     America or any State thereof which expressly assumes in
     writing the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and
     premium (if any) and interest on, all of the Notes, and the
     due and punctual performance of the obligations of the
     Company hereunder and under the Notes, provided that prior to
     any such transaction becoming effective, (l) each holder of
     the Notes shall receive written notice from the Company
     describing the proposed transaction, (2) all instruments and
     documents evidencing such assumption shall be in form and
     substance satisfactory to the Required Holders and (3) each
     holder of the Notes shall receive an opinion of counsel
     reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders that such
     instrument of assumption has been duly authorized, executed
     and delivered by the assuming corporation and is valid,
     binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and that
     the transaction complies with the requirements of this
     Section.

          Immediately after any consolidation, merger or other
disposition under Subsection A or B above (i) no Default or Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the
Company would be permitted to incur at least $1 of additional Debt
under Section 8.4C.  If any such consolidation, merger or other
disposition under Subsection A or B above has the effect of 
requiring a Subsidiary to execute and deliver a Subsidiary
Guaranty in accordance with Section 8.11, such requirements shall
have been satisfied prior to or concurrently with the
effectiveness of such consolidation, merger or other disposition
notwithstanding the time limits in Section 8.11.

          SECTION 10.  Sale of Assets.  The Company will not, and

          B.  the Company or a Subsidiary may sell or otherwise
     dispose of assets in the ordinary course of business;

          C.  any Subsidiary may sell, lease, assign, transfer or
     otherwise dispose of assets to the Company or any
     Wholly-owned Subsidiary; and

          D.  the Company or any Subsidiary may dispose of any of
     its assets for fair value if (l) no Default or Event of
     Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (2) either
     (a) such assets and all other assets disposed of by the
     Company and its Subsidiaries under this Subsection during the
     12-month period ending on the date of such proposed
     disposition shall not have an aggregate book value in excess
     of 10% of Consolidated Total Assets or have accounted for
     more than 10% of consolidated net sales or 10% of
     consolidated net operating profit of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries (before corporate allocations) for either of the
     two most recently ended fiscal years, all determined in
     accordance with GAAP, or (b) an amount equal to the net
     proceeds (after all fees and expenses incurred and all taxes
     have been paid) realized upon such disposition is applied to
     the acquisition or construction for cash (but not in a
     transaction permitted by Section 8.5C) of similar assets
     within one year after the date of such disposition.

          SECTION 11.  Additional Subsidiary Guaranties; Etc.

          A.  If after the Closing Date any Subsidiary that has
     not theretofore executed and delivered a Subsidiary Guaranty
     hereunder becomes a Material Subsidiary, promptly thereafter
     and in any event within 60 days after the end of the fiscal
     period in which such Subsidiary first becomes a Material
     Subsidiary, the Company will cause such Subsidiary to execute
     and deliver a Subsidiary Guaranty and will furnish each
     holder of the Notes with an executed counterpart of such
     Subsidiary Guaranty and an opinion of counsel required by
     Subsection C below.


          B.  If after the Closing Date any Subsidiary that has
     not theretofore executed and delivered a Subsidiary Guaranty
     hereunder proposes (in one transaction or a series of related
     transactions) to incur Debt for borrowed money in a principal
     amount exceeding $1,500,000 or to Guarantee Debt for borrowed
     money of the Company or a Material Subsidiary in a principal
     amount exceeding $1,500,000 or to incur Debt and Guarantee
     Debt in any combination aggregating more than $1,500,000 then
     prior to or concurrently with the incurrence of such Debt or
     Guarantee, as the case may be, and subject to the
     requirements of Subsection D below, the Company will cause
     such Subsidiary to execute and deliver a Subsidiary Guaranty
     and will furnish each holder of the Notes with an executed
     counterpart of such Subsidiary Guaranty and an opinion of
     counsel required by Subsection C below.

          C.  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of any
     subsidiary Guaranty pursuant to Subsection A or Subsection B
     above the Company will also furnish each holder of the Notes
     with an opinion of Mays & Valentine or other counsel
     satisfactory to the Required Holders (which opinion shall be
     satisfactory to the Required Holders and may be subject to
     customary exceptions, qualifications and limitations under
     the circumstances) to the effect that such Subsidiary
     Guaranty has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
     such Subsidiary and is valid, binding and enforceable in
     accordance with its terms.

          D.  Prior to or concurrently with the incurrence of any
     Debt for borrowed money or the execution and delivery of any
     Guarantee in respect of Debt for borrowed money, or any
     combination thereof as aforesaid, in each case in a principal
     amount exceeding $1,500,000, by any Subsidiary which has
     theretofore executed and delivered a Subsidiary Guaranty
     hereunder (or is concurrently required to do so as aforesaid)
     either (1) the Company will cause assurances satisfactory to
     the Required Holders to be provided to each holder of the
     Notes that the claims of the holders of the Notes against

     and as the same shall become due and payable (whether at
     stated maturity, by notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (b)
     the performance or observance of any material term, covenant
     or agreement in respect of any such Debt or under any
     agreement or instrument relating to any such Debt, and in any
     case any applicable grace period shall have expired, or (2)
     any other event shall occur or condition shall exist in
     respect of any Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary which is
     outstanding in an aggregate unpaid principal amount exceeding
     $1,000,000, or under any agreement or instrument relating to
     any such Debt, the effect of which is to cause the 
     acceleration of the maturity of such Debt or to require the
     repayment or repurchase of such Debt;

          F.  the Company or any Subsidiary shall (l) apply for or
     consent to the appointment of, or the taking of possession
     by, a receiver, custodian, trustee or liquidator of itself or
     of all or a substantial part of its property, (2) be
     generally unable to pay its debts as such debts become due,

     creditors, (4) commence a voluntary case under any law
     relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, (5)

     in a timely or appropriate manner (but within 30 days in any
     event), or acquiesce in writing to, any petition filed
     against it in an involuntary case under any law relating to
     bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, (7) take any action
     under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation analogous
     to any of the foregoing, or (8) take any corporate action for
     the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing;

          G.  a proceeding or case shall be commenced against the
     Company or any Subsidiary, without the application or consent
     of the Company or such Subsidiary in any court of competent
     jurisdiction seeking (l) its liquidation, reorganization,
     dissolution or winding up, or composition or readjustment of
     its debts, (2) the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
     custodian, liquidator, encumbrancer or the like of it or of
     all or any substantial part of its assets or (3) similar
     relief in respect of it under any law providing for the
     relief of debtors, and such proceeding or case shall continue
     undismissed, or unstayed and in effect, for a period of 45
     days; or an order for relief shall be entered in an
     involuntary case under any law relating to bankruptcy,
     insolvency or reorganization against the Company or any
     Subsidiary;

          H.  any representation or warranty made by the Company
     or any Subsidiary in this Agreement or in any certificate or
     other instrument delivered hereunder or pursuant here to
     shall prove to be false or incorrect or breached in any
     material respect on the date as of which made;

          I.  any provision of any Subsidiary Guaranty shall cease
     to be in full force and effect for any reason whatsoever
     (other than the release or waiver thereof by the holders of
     the Notes) or any Subsidiary shall contest or deny in writing
     the validity or enforceability of any of its obligations
     under its Subsidiary Guaranty or any Person that has
     delivered a Subsidiary Guaranty pursuant to Section 4.5 or
     8.11 shall cease to be a Subsidiary;


          J.  final judgment for the payment of money shall be
     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against the
     Company or any Subsidiary, and such judgment shall not be
     discharged or execution thereof stayed pending appeal, within
     20 days after entry thereof or, in the event of such a stay,
     such judgment shall not be discharged within 10 days after
     such stay expires and such judgment together with all other
     such judgments shall exceed in the aggregate $1,000,000; or

          K.  any Change of Control;

then (i) upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
Subsection F or G above with respect to the Company, the unpaid
principal amount of all Notes, together with the interest accrued
thereon, shall automatically become immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or other requirements of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Company or
(ii) upon the occurrence and continuance of any other Event of
Default, the Required Holders may, by written notice to the
Company, declare the unpaid principal amount of all Notes to be,
and the same shall forthwith become, due and payable, together
with the interest accrued thereon and, to the extent permitted by
law, an amount equal to the Additional Amount (as hereinafter
defined) in respect of each such Note, without presentment,
further demand, protest or other requirements of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Company, provided that
during the existence of an Event of Default described in
Subsection A, B or K above with respect to any Note, the holder of
such Note may, by written notice to the Company declare such Note
to be, and the same shall forthwith become, due and payable,
together with the interest accrued thereon and, to the extent
permitted by law, an amount equal to the Additional Amount,
without presentment, further demand, protest or other requirements
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Company.  If any holder of any Note shall exercise the option
specified in the proviso to the preceding sentence, the Company
will forthwith give written notice thereof to the holders of all
other outstanding Notes and each such holder may (whether or not
such notice is given or received), by written notice to the
Company, declare the unpaid principal amount of all Notes held by
it to be, and the same shall forthwith become, due and payable,
together with the interest accrued thereon and, to the extent
permitted by law, an amount equal to the Additional Amount,
without presentment, further demand, protest or other requirements
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Company.  If all Notes are accelerated as specified above, the
Company will forthwith give written notice thereof to any holder
of an outstanding Note which has not given written notice to the
Company with respect to such acceleration.

          For purposes of this Section, the term "Additional
Amount" means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the
Make-Whole Amount that would be payable with respect to such Note 
if the Company had elected to prepay such Note in full pursuant to
Section 5.2 on the date of acceleration.

          Promptly following the acceleration of all of the Notes
by the Required Holders pursuant to this Section, the Computing
Holder in respect of such acceleration shall give written notice
to the Company of the amount of the Additional Amount in respect
of the Notes so accelerated (which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the computation of such Additional Amount and
the assumptions made in connection therewith).  Such notice shall
be given within one Business Day if such Computing Holder has
given such notice of acceleration and otherwise promptly after
such Computing Holder has knowledge of such acceleration.  If any
Note has been accelerated pursuant to the proviso to clause (ii)
of the first paragraph of this Section, then the holder which has
so accelerated such Note shall give written notice to the Company
of the Additional Amount in respect of such Note promptly after
such acceleration. The failure by a Computing Holder or any other
holder of a Note to give notice as aforesaid as to the
determination of the Additional Amount in respect of any Note
shall not relieve the Company of its obligation as of the date of
such acceleration to pay such Additional Amount forthwith after
such Additional Amount is determined (and in such case the
determination of such Additional Amount by the holder of any Note
which has been so accelerated shall be deemed to be conclusive
with respect to such Note absent manifest error).

          SECTION 2.  Suits for Enforcement.  If any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the holder of any
Note may proceed to protect and enforce its rights, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this
Agreement, or the holder of any Note may proceed to enforce the
payment of all sums due upon such Note or to enforce any other
legal or equitable right of the holder of such Note.

          The Company covenants that, if it shall default in the
making of any payment due under any Note or in the performance or
observance of any agreement contained in this Agreement, it will
pay to the holder thereof such further amounts, to the extent
lawful, as shall be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses of
collection or of otherwise enforcing such holder's rights,
including counsel fees.

          SECTION 3.  Remedies Cumulative.  No remedy herein
conferred upon you or the holder of any Note is intended to be
exclusive of any other remedy and each and every such remedy shall
be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by
statute or otherwise.


          SECTION 4.  Remedies Not Waived.  No course of dealing
between the Company and you or the holder of any Note and no delay
or failure in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note in
respect thereof shall operate as a waiver of any of your rights or
the rights of any holder of such Note.

          SECTION 11.  REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF
NOTES.  The Company will keep at the Company's principal executive
office or at such other office as the Company may designate in
writing to the holders of the Notes a register (the "Note
Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe, but at its expense (other than transfer taxes, if
any), it will provide for the registration and transfer of Notes.

          Whenever any Note shall be surrendered either at such
office of the Company or at the place of payment named in such
Note, for transfer or exchange, within five Business Days
thereafter the Company will execute and deliver in exchange
therefor a new Note or Notes, as may be requested by such holder,
in the same aggregate unpaid principal amount as the unpaid
principal amount of the Note so surrendered.  Each such new Note
shall be payable to such person as such holder may request.  Each
Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of
such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing,
which endorsement or written instrument shall be satisfactory to
the Company.  Any Note issued in exchange for any other Note or
upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest
and interest to accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged
or transferred, and neither gain nor loss of interest shall result
from any such transfer or exchange.  Any transfer tax relating to
such transaction shall be paid by the holder requesting the
exchange.

          The Company and any agent of the Company may deem and
treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the owner
of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal
of and premium (if any) and interest on such Note and for all
other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue.

          SECTION 12.  LOST, ETC., NOTES.  Upon receipt by the
Company of evidence reasonable and satisfactory to it of the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note, and (in case of
loss, theft or destruction) of indemnity satisfactory to it, and
upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, if mutilated, within
five Business Days thereafter the Company will deliver in lieu of
such Note a new Note in a like unpaid principal amount, dated as
of the date to which interest has been paid thereon.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section, if any Note of which you or any other institutional
holder is the owner is lost, stolen or destroyed, then the
affidavit of your or such holder's treasurer or assistant 
treasurer (or other responsible official), setting forth the
circumstances with respect to such loss, theft or destruction,
shall be accepted as satisfactory evidence thereof, and no
indemnity shall be required as a condition to the execution and
delivery by the Company of a new Note in lieu of such Note (or as
a condition to the payment thereof, if due and payable) other than
your or such holder's unsecured written agreement (in form and
substance satisfactory to the Company) to indemnify the Company.

          SECTION 13.  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.  A.  Any provision of
this Agreement, the Notes or any Subsidiary Guaranty may, with the
consent of the Company, be amended or waived (either generally or
in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), by one or more substantially concurrent written
instruments signed by the Required Holders, provided that

          (1)  no such amendment or waiver shall 

               (a)  change the rate, the date or the time of
     payment of interest on any of the Notes, change the maturity
     of any of the Notes or affect the premium payable on any
     prepayment of a Note, or modify Section 14, without the
     consent of the holder of each Note so affected,

               (b)  modify any of the provisions of this
     Agreement with respect to the payment or prepayment or
     purchase of any Note, or reduce the percentage of the
     principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are
     required to approve any such amendment or effectuate any such
     amendment or effectuate any such waiver, or release any
     Subsidiary Guaranty, without the consent of the holders of
     all the Notes then outstanding, or

               (c)  be effective prior to the Closing Date without
     your consent, and

          (2)  no such waiver shall extend to or affect any
     obligation not expressly waived or impair any right
     consequent thereon.

          B.  Any amendment or waiver pursuant to Subsection A
above shall apply equally to all the holders of the Notes and
shall be binding upon them, upon each future holder of any Note
and upon the Company, in each case whether or not a notation
thereof shall have been placed on any Note.

          C.  The Company will not solicit, request or negotiate
for or with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or the Notes unless each holder
of a Note (irrespective of the principal amount of Notes then held
by it) shall be informed thereof by the Company and shall be
afforded the opportunity of considering the same and shall be
supplied by the Company with sufficient information to enable it
to make an informed decision with respect thereto.  Executed or
true and correct copies of any amendment or waiver effected 
pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be delivered by
the Company to each holder of Notes forthwith following the date
on which the same shall have become effective.  Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates will directly or indirectly pay
or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of
supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, to any
holder of a Note as consideration for or as an inducement to the
entering into by such holder of any such amendment or waiver
unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, on the same terms,
ratably to the holders of all of the Notes then outstanding.

          D.  For purposes of determining whether the holders of
outstanding Notes of the requisite unpaid principal amount at any
time have taken any action authorized by this Section or otherwise
by this Agreement, any Notes owned by the Company, any Subsidiary
or any Affiliate of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding.

          SECTION 14.  HOME OFFICE PAYMENT.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Notes, so long
as you or any nominee designated by you shall be the holder of any
Note, the Company shall punctually pay all amounts which become
due and payable on such Note by transfer of immediately available
funds to you prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, in the manner and
at your address as set forth in Schedule I, or at such other place
or in such other manner as you may designate by notice to the
Company, without presentation or surrender of such Note.  You
agree that prior to the sale, transfer or other disposition of any
such Note, you will make notation thereon of the portion of the
principal amount prepaid and the date to which interest has been
paid thereon, or surrender the same in exchange for a Note or
Notes aggregating the same principal amount as the unpaid
principal amount of the Note so surrendered.  The Company shall
enter into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section
with any other institutional investor that is a holder of a Note
(or nominee thereof) who shall have agreed to comply with the
requirements of this Section.

          SECTION 15.  LIABILITIES OF THE PURCHASER.  Neither this
Agreement nor any disposition of any of the Notes shall be deemed
to create any liability or obligation of you or any other holder
of any Note to enforce any provision hereof or of any of the Notes
for the benefit or on behalf of any other person who may be the
holder of any Note.

          SECTION 16.  CERTAIN TAXES.  The Company will pay all
stamp, documentary or similar taxes which may be payable in
respect of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
Subsidiary Guaranty or any of the Notes (but not their transfer)
or of any amendment of, or waiver or consent under or with respect
to, this Agreement, any Subsidiary Guaranty or of any of the Notes
and will save you and all subsequent holders of the Notes harmless
against any loss or liability resulting from nonpayment or delay
in payment of any such tax.  The obligations of the Company under
this Section shall survive the payment of the Notes.


          SECTION 17.  MISCELLANEOUS.

          SECTION 1.  Expenses.  The Company agrees, whether or
not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be consummated, to
pay all expenses incident to such transactions (including all
document production costs and other expenses, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of your special counsel and any local counsel
selected by you for their services with relation to such
transactions, the expenses of obtaining a private placement number
for the Notes as contemplated by Section 4.6 and all out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the shipping to and from your office
or the office of your nominee of the Notes and upon any exchange
or substitution pursuant to the provisions of the Notes or this
Agreement), and to reimburse you for any out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith.  The Company also agrees to pay all
reasonable expenses incurred by you (including counsel and
investment banking or financial consultant fees) in connection
with any investigation of any Default or Event of Default, the
enforcement and collection of the Notes, the enforcement of this
Agreement or any Subsidiary Guaranty, and in connection with any
amendment or requested amendment of, or waiver or consent or
requested waiver or consent under or with respect to, this
Agreement, any Subsidiary Guaranty or any of the Notes, whether or
not the same shall become effective.  The obligations of the
Company under this Section shall survive the payment of the Notes.

          In furtherance of the foregoing, on the Closing Date the
Company will pay or cause to be paid the reasonable fees and
disbursements of your special counsel which are reflected in the
statement of such special counsel submitted to the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date.  The Company will also pay, promptly
upon receipt of supplemental statements therefor, reasonable
additional fees, if any, and disbursements of such special counsel
in connection with the transactions hereby contemplated (including
disbursements unposted as of the Closing Date).

          SECTION 2.  Indemnification.  The Company agrees, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, exonerate and
hold you and each of your officers, directors, employees and
agents (collectively the "Indemnitees" and individually an
"Indemnitee") free and harmless from and against any and all
actions, causes of action, suits, losses, liabilities and damages,
and expenses in connection therewith, including without limitation
reasonable counsel fees and disbursements (collectively the
"Indemnified Liabilities") incurred by the Indemnitees or any of
them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to any
transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part
directly or indirectly with proceeds from the sale of any of the
Notes, or the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of
this Agreement, any instrument contemplated hereby by any of the
Indemnitees, except as to any Indemnitee for any such Indemnified
Liabilities arising on account of such Indemnitee's gross
negligence or willful misconduct; and if and to the extent the
foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for any reason, the 
Company agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and
satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is
permissible under applicable law.  The obligations of the Company
under this Section shall survive payment of the Notes.

          SECTION 3.  Reliance on and Survival of Representations.
All agreements, representations and warranties of the Company
herein and in any certificates or other instruments delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall (A) be deemed to have been relied
upon by you, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or
hereafter made by you or on your behalf, and (B) survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the delivery of the
Notes to you, and shall continue in effect so long as any Note is
outstanding and thereafter as provided in Sections 16, 17.1 and
17.2.

          SECTION 4.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement
shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Company and its respective permitted successors and assigns
hereunder, you and your successors and assigns, and, in addition,
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by all holders
from time to time of the Notes; provided that the benefit of
Sections 12 (as to satisfactory indemnity) and 14 shall be limited
as provided therein.

          SECTION 5.  Communications.  All notices and other
communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be sent by confirmed facsimile transmission (with an
undertaking to provide hard copy by overnight mail on the date of
such transmission) or delivered by hand or sent by a reputable
overnight courier service prepaid (with confirmation of receipt)

          A.  if to the Company, at 6620 West Broad Street, Suite
     500 (23230), Richmond, Virginia 23261-7367, Attention: David
     E. Bosher, or at such other address as the Company, may
     hereafter designate by notice to you and to each other holder
     of a Note at the time outstanding, or

          B.  if to you, at your address as set forth in Schedule
     I or at such other address as you may hereafter designate by
     notice to the Company, or

          C.  if to any other holder of a Note, at the address of
     such holder as it appears on the Note Register.

          Any notice or other communication herein provided to be
given to the holders of all outstanding Notes shall be deemed to
have been duly given if sent as aforesaid to each of the
registered holders of the Notes at the time outstanding at the
address for such purpose of such holder as it appears on the Note
Register.


          SECTION 6.  Jurisdiction and Process; Waiver of Jurv
Trial.  The Company agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or any
other document executed in connection herewith, or any legal
action or proceeding to execute or otherwise enforce any judgment
obtained against the Company for breach hereof or thereof, or
against any of its properties, may be brought in the courts of the
State of New York or the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York by you or on your behalf or by or on
behalf of any holder of a Note, as you or such holder may elect,
and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for purposes of any
such legal action or proceeding.  The Company consents to process
being served in any suit, action or proceeding by sending a copy
thereof by any reputable commercial delivery service or by mailing
a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to the address of the Company specified
in Section 17.5.  The Company agrees that such service upon
receipt (A) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (B)
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held
to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to the
Company.  In addition, the Company hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Notes or any other document executed in connection herewith
brought in the courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and
any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

          The Company waives trial by jury in any action brought
on or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any other
document executed in connection herewith.

          SECTION 7.  Governing Law.  This Agreement and the Notes
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York.

          SECTION 8.  Headings.  The headings in this Agreement
are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or
otherwise affect any of the terms hereof.

          SECTION 9.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

Agreement shall become a binding agreement between you and the
Company.


                              Very truly yours,

                 [FORMS OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY]

     GUARANTY dated as of ____________ made by __________________,
a _____________ corporation (the "Guarantor"), in favor of the
holders from time to time of the Notes referred to below
(collectively, the "Obligees").

     WHEREAS, Cadmus Communications Corporation, a Virginia
corporation (the "Company"), has entered into several Note
Purchase Agreements dated as of December 15, 1993 (as amended or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Note Agreements" and
terms defined therein and not otherwise defined herein are being
used herein as so defined) with the institutional purchasers
listed in Schedule I thereto, pursuant to which the Company has
issued and sold to such purchasers $40,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its 6.74% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2003 (the "Notes");

     [WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the purchase of the
Notes by such purchasers under the Note Agreements that the
Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty;/

     WHEREAS, the Company is obligated under the Note Agreements
to cause each Person that from time to time after the Closing Date
becomes a Material Subsidiary and, under certain circumstances,
certain other Subsidiaries, to execute and deliver a Subsidiary
Guaranty substantially in the form of this Guaranty; and

     WHEREAS, the Guarantor is one of the Subsidiaries described
above.]

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises the
Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

     SECTION 1.  Guaranty.  The Guarantor unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations
of the Company arising under the Notes and the Note Agreements,
including all extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments
and renewals thereof, whether for principal, interest (including
without limitation interest on any overdue principal, premium and
interest at the rate specified in the Notes and interest accruing
or becoming owing both prior to and subsequent to the commencement
of any proceeding against or with respect to the Company under any
chapter of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, 11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq.),
Make-Whole Amount, Additional Amount, fees, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations are called the
"Guaranteed Obligations"); provided that the aggregate liability of
the Guarantor hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall not exceed at any time the least of (a) 
$60,000,000, (b) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations and (c)
the maximum amount for which the Guarantor is liable under this
Guaranty without such liability being deemed a fraudulent transfer
under applicable Debtor Relief Laws (as hereinafter defined), as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  As used herein,
the term "Debtor Relief Laws" means any applicable liquidation,
conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium, rearrangement,
insolvency, reorganization or similar debtor relief laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally from time to time in effect.

          The Guarantor also agrees to pay, in addition to the
amount stated above, any and all reasonable expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by any Obligee in
enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or in connection with any
amendment of this Guaranty.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this
Guaranty guarantees, to the extent provided herein, the payment of
all amounts which constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations
and would be owed by any other Person to any Obligee but for the
fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the
existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding
involving such Person.

          SECTION 2.  Guaranty Absolute.  The Guarantor guarantees
that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of the Notes and the Note Agreements,
regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of any Obligee with respect thereto. The obligations of the
Guarantor under this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty,
irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Company
or any other Person liable for the Guaranteed Obligations or
whether the Company or any other such Person is joined in any such
action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional
irrespective of:

          A.   any lack of validity or enforceability of any
     Guaranteed Obligation, any Note, any Note Agreement, any
     other Subsidiary Guaranty or any agreement or instrument
     relating thereto;

          B.   any change in the time, manner or place of payment
     of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed
     Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any
     consent to departure from any Note or Note Agreement or
     Subsidiary Guaranty;

          C.   any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of
     any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver
     of or consent to departure by the Guarantor or other Person 
     liable, or any other guarantee, for all or any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations;

          D.   any manner of application of collateral, or
     proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed
     Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of
     any collateral or any other assets of the Company or any
     other Subsidiary;

          E.   any change, restructuring or termination of the
     corporate structure or existence of the Company or any other
     Subsidiary; or

          F.   any other circumstance (including, without
     limitation, any statute of limitations) that might otherwise
     constitute a defense, offset or counterclaim available to, or
     a discharge of, the Company or the Guarantor.

          This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment or any
of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by any Obligee, or any other Person upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

          SECTION 3.  Waivers.  The Guarantor hereby irrevocably
waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

          A.   promptness, diligence, presentment, notice of
     acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty;

          B.   any requirement that any Obligee or any other
     Person protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any
     property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any
     action against the Company or any other Person or any
     collateral;

          C.   any defense, offset or counterclaim arising by
     reason of any claim or defense based upon any action by any
     Obligee;

          D.   any duty on the part of any Obligee to disclose to
     the Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the
     business, operation or condition of any Person and its assets
     now known or hereafter known by such Person; and

          E.   any rights by which it might be entitled to require
     suit on an accrued right of action in respect of any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations or require suit against the Company or
     the Guarantor or any other Person.


          SECTION 4.  Waiver of Subrogation and Contribution. The
Guarantor shall not assert, enforce, or otherwise exercise (A) any
right of subrogation to any of the rights, remedies, powers,
privileges or liens of any Obligee or any other beneficiary
against the Company or any other obligor on the Guaranteed
Obligations or any collateral or other security, or (B) any right
of recourse, reimbursement, contribution, indemnification, or
similar right against the Company, and the Guarantor hereby waives
any and all of the foregoing rights, remedies, powers, privileges
and the benefit of, and any right to participate in, any
collateral or other security given to any Obligee or any other
beneficiary to secure payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The
provisions of this Section 4 shall survive the termination of this
Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company by
virtue of any payment, court order or law.

          SECTION 5.  Representations and Warranties.  The
Guarantor hereby represents and warrants as follows:

          A.   The Guarantor is a corporation duly organized,
     validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
     jurisdiction of incorporation.  The execution, delivery and
     performance of this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all
     necessary action on the part of the Guarantor.

          B.   The execution, delivery and performance by the
     Guarantor of this Guaranty will not (i) contravene, result in
     any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in
     the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of the
     Guarantor under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, bank
     loan or credit agreement, corporate charter or by-laws, or
     any other agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor is a
     party or by which the Guarantor or any of its properties may
     be bound or affected, (ii) conflict with or result in a
     breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
     Order of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Body
     applicable to the Guarantor or (iii) violate any provision of
     any statute or any rule or regulation of any Governmental
     Body applicable to the Guarantor.

          C.   The Guarantor and the Company are members of the
     same consolidated group of companies and are engaged in
     related businesses and the Guarantor will derive substantial
     direct and indirect benefit from the execution and delivery
     of this Guaranty.

          SECTION 6.  Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Guaranty and no consent to any departure by
the Guarantor there from shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Holders,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given;
provided that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by all Obligees, (i) limit the liability of, or 
release the Guarantor hereunder, (ii) postpone any date fixed for,
or change the amount of, any payment hereunder or (iii) change the
percentage of Notes the holders of which are, or the number of
Obligees, required to take any action hereunder.

          SECTION 7.  Addresses for Notices.  All notices and
other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be sent by confirmed facsimile transmission (with an
undertaking to provide hard copy) or delivered by hand or sent by
a reputable overnight courier service prepaid (with confirmation
of receipt), if to the Guarantor addressed to it at the address of
the Guarantor provided below its name on the signature page of
this Guaranty or at such other address as the Guarantor may
hereafter designate by notice to each holder of Notes, or if to
any holder of Notes, addressed to it as set forth in the Note
Agreements.  Any notice or other communication herein provided to
be given to the holders of all outstanding Notes shall be deemed
to have been duly given if sent as aforesaid to each of the
registered holders of the Notes at the time outstanding at the
address for such purpose of such holder as it appears on the Note
Register.

          SECTION 8.  No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part
of any Obligee to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.  Right of Set-off.  Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default each Obligee is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
indebtedness at any time owing by such Obligee to or for the
credit or the account of the Guarantor against any and all of the
obligations of the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this
Guaranty, irrespective of whether such Obligee shall have made any
demand under this Guaranty and although such obligations may be
contingent and unmatured.  By its acceptance of a Note, each
Obligee agrees promptly to notify the Guarantor after any such
set-off and application made by such Obligee; provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application. The rights of each Obligee under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies that such
Obligee may have.

          SECTION 10.  Continuing Guaranty.  This Guaranty is a
continuing guarantee of payment and performance and shall (A)
remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty, (B) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and
assigns and (C) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Obligees, and their successors, transferees and assigns.


          SECTION 11.  Jurisdiction and Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial.  The Guarantor agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Guaranty or any other document
executed in connection herewith, or any legal action or proceeding
to execute or otherwise enforce any judgment obtained against the
Guarantor for breach hereof or thereof, or against any of its
properties, may be brought in the courts of the State of New York
or the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York by any Obligee or on its behalf, as such Obligee may
elect, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for
purposes of any such legal action or proceeding.  The Guarantor
consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding
by sending a copy thereof by any reputable commercial delivery
service or by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address of
the Guarantor specified in Section 7.  The Guarantor agrees that
such service upon receipt (A) shall be deemed in every respect
effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or
proceeding and (B) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal
delivery to it.  In addition, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Guaranty or any other document executed in connection herewith
brought in the courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York and
any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

          The Guarantor waives trial by jury in any action brought
on or with respect to this Guaranty or any other document executed
in connection herewith.

          SECTION 12.  Governing Law.  This Guaranty shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to
be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.

Options may be granted to Key Employees at any time and from time to time as
shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have complete
discretion in determining the number of Shares subject to Options granted to
each Participant, provided, however, that the aggregate Fair Market Value

Participant may first exercise ISOs granted under the Plan during any calendar
year may not exceed $100,000 or such amount as shall be specified in Section
422A of the Code and rules and regulation there under.

Option ("Option Price") shall be determined by the Committee subject to the
following limitations.  In the case of an ISO, the Option Price shall not be

Value of the Stock on the Grant Date.

shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary date of its Award
Date.

at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the
Committee shall determine, which need not be the same for all Participants.  No
Option, however, shall be exercisable until the expiration of at least six
months after the Award Date, except that such limitation shall not apply in the
case of death or disability of the Participant.

     6.6  Method of Exercise.  Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a
written notice to the Company in the form prescribed by the Committee setting
forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised,
accompanied by full payment for the Shares.  The Option Price shall be payable
to the Company in full either in cash, by delivery of Shares of Stock valued at
Fair Market Value at the time of exercise, delivery of a promissory note or by a
combination of the foregoing.  As soon as practicable, after receipt of written
notice and payment, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, stock
certificates in an appropriate amount based upon the number of Options
exercised, issued in the Participant's name.  No Participant who is awarded
Options shall have rights as a shareholder until the date of exercise of the
Options.

     6.7  Options Awarded Upon Stock Delivery Exercise.  The Committee, in its
discretion, may provide in the Agreement that, in the event a Participant pays
the Option Price for an Option by delivery of previously acquired Shares, the
Participant will be granted a new Option ("Replacement Option") for that number
of Shares delivered in payment of the Option Price of the original Option
("Original Option").  The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of
the Replacement Option; provided, however, that the Option Price of Replacement
Option shall be the Fair Market Value of Shares on its Award Date and the term
of the Replacement Option shall expire upon the expiration date of the Original
Option.

     6.8  Restrictions on Stock Transferability.  The Committee shall impose
such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option

which such Shares are then listed and under any blue sky or state securities
laws applicable to such Shares.

     6.9  Nontransferability of Options.  No Option granted under the Plan may
be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,

lifetime only by such Participant or his guardian or legal representative.

conditions of the Plan.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to
Participants, at the discretion of the Committee, in any of the following forms:

          (b)  In connection with and exercisable in addition to the grant of
     Options ("Additive SARs");

          (c)  Independent of grant of the Options ("Freestanding SARs"); or

          (d)  In any combination of the foregoing.


     7.2  Exercise of Tandem SARs.  Tandem SARs may be exercised with respect to
all or part of the Shares subject to the Related Option.  The exercise of Tandem
SARs shall cause a reduction in the number of Shares subject to the Related
Option equal to the number of Shares with respect to which the Tandem SAR is
exercised.  Conversely, the exercise, in whole or part, of a Related Option,
shall cause a reduction in the number of Shares subject to the Tandem Option
equal to the number of Shares with respect to which the Related Option is
exercised.  Shares with respect to which the Tandem SAR shall have been
exercised may not be subject again to an Award under the Plan.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Tandem
SAR shall expire no later than the expiration of the Related Option, shall be
transferable only when and under the same conditions as the Related Option and
shall be exercisable only when the Related Option is eligible to be exercised.
In addition, if the Related Option is an ISO, a Tandem SAR shall be exercised
for no more than 100% of the difference between the Option Price of the Related
Option and the Fair Market Value of Shares subject to he Related Option at the
time the Tandem SAR is exercised.

     7.3  Exercise of Additive SARs.  Additive SARs shall be deemed to be
exercised upon, and in addition to, the exercise of the Related Options.  The
deemed exercise of Additive SARs shall not reduce the number of Shares with
respect to which the Related Options remains unexercised.

     7.4  Exercise of Freestanding SARs.  Freestanding SARs may be exercised
upon whatever terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion,
imposes upon such SARs.

     7.5  Other Conditions Applicable to SARs.  No SAR granted under the Plan
shall be exercisable until the expiration of at least six months after the Grant
Date, except that such limitation shall not apply in the case of the death or
disability of the Participant.  In no event shall the term of any SAR granted
under the Plan exceed ten years from the Grant Date.  A SAR may be exercised
only when the Fair Market Value of a Share exceeds either (a) the Fair Market
Value per Share on the Grant Date in the case of a Freestanding SAR or (b) the
Option Price of the Related Option in the case of either a Tandem or Additive
SAR.  A SAR shall be exercised by delivery to the Committee of a notice of
exercise in the form prescribed by the Committee.

     7.6  Payment Upon Exercise of SARs.  Subject to the provisions of the
Agreement, upon the exercise of a SAR, the Participant is entitled to receive,
without any payment to the Company (other than required tax withholding
amounts), an amount equal to the product of multiplying (i) the number of Shares
with respect to which the SAR is exercised by (ii) an amount equal to the excess
of (A) the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of exercise of the SAR over
(B) either (x) the Fair Market Value per Share on the Award Date in the case of
a Freestanding SAR or (y) the Option Price of the Related Option in the case of
either a Tandem or additive SAR.

     Payment to the Participant shall be made in Shares, valued at the Fair
Market Value of the date of exercise, in cash if the Participant has so elected
in his written notice of exercise and Committee has consented thereto, or a
combination thereof.  To the extent required to satisfy the conditions of Rule
16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act, or any successor or similar rule, or as
otherwise provided in the Agreement, the Committee shall have the sole
discretion to consent to or disapprove the election of any Participant to
receive cash in full or partial settlement of a SAR.  In cases where an election
of settlement in cash must be consented to by the Committee, the Committee may
consent to, or disapprove, such election at any time after such election, or
within such period for taking action as is specified in the election, and
failure to give consent shall be disapproval. Consent may be given in whole or
as to a portion of the SAR surrendered by the Participant.  If the election to
receive cash is disapproved in whole or in part, the SAR shall be deemed to have
been exercised for Shares, or, if so specified in the notice of exercise and
election, not to have been exercised to the extent the election to receive cash
is disapproved.

     7.5  Nontransferability of SARs.  No SAR granted under the Plan may be
sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,
otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Further, all
SARs granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his
lifetime only by such Participant or his guardian or legal representative.

law. Stock or other securities purchased pursuant to Other Stock Unit Awards may
be purchased for such purchase Price as the Committee shall determine, which
Price shall be not less than 50% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock or other
securities on the Award Date.

     10.2 Sale and Transferability.  Stock or other securities issued pursuant
to Other Stock Unit Awards may not be sold by a Participant until the expiration
of at least six months from the Award Date, except that such limitation shall
not apply in the case of death or disability of a Participant.  To the extent
Other Stock Unit Awards are deemed to be derivative securities within the
meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, a Participant's rights with
respect to such Awards shall not vest or be exercisable until the expiration of
at least six months from the Award Date.  To the extent an Other Stock Unit
Award granted under the Plan is deemed to be a derivative security within the
meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, it may not be sold, transferred,
pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, otherwise than by
will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  All rights with respect to
such Other Stock Unit Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be
exercisable during his lifetime only by such Participant or his guardian or
personal representative.

                                  ARTICLE XI.
                             Loans to Participants

     The Committee is authorized to make loans to Participants, upon such terms
and conditions as deemed appropriate by the Committee, for the purpose of
enabling Participants to pay the Option Price for Shares or other purchase price
of Awards made under the Plan.  Such loans may include amounts necessary to pay
Participant's tax liability in connection with an Award.

                                  ARTICLE XII.
                               Change in Control

     In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, the Committee, as
constituted before such Change in Control, in its sole discretion may, as to any
outstanding Award, either at the time the Award is made or any time thereafter,
take any one or more of the following actions: (i) provide for the acceleration
of any time periods relating to the exercise or realization of any such Award so
that such Award may be exercised or realized in full on or before a date
initially fixed by the Committee; (ii) provide for the purchase or settlement of
any such Award by the Company, upon a Participant's request, for an amount of
cash equal to the amount which could have been obtained upon the exercise of
such Award or realization of such Participant's rights had such Award been
currently exercisable or payable; (iii) make such adjustment to any such Award
then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Change in
Control; or (iv) cause any such Award then outstanding to be assumed, or new
rights substituted therefor, by the acquiring or surviving corporation in such
Change in Control.

                                 ARTICLE XIII.
                 Modification, Extension and Renewal of Awards

     Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan,
the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Awards, or, if authorized
by the Board, accept the surrender of outstanding Awards (to the extent not yet
exercised) granted under the Plan and authorize the granting of new Awards
pursuant to the Plan in substitution therefor, and the substituted Awards may
specify a lower exercise price than the surrendered Awards, a longer term than
the surrendered Awards or may contain any other provisions that are authorized
by the Plan.  The Committee may also modify, the terms of an outstanding
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no modification of an Award,
shall, without the consent of the Participant, adversely affect the rights or
obligations of the Participant.

                                  ARTICLE XIV.
              Amendment, Modification and Termination of the Plan

     14.1 Amendment, Modification and Termination.  At any time and from time to
time, the Board may terminate, amend, or modify the Plan.  Such amendment or
modification may be without shareholder approval except to the extent that such
approval is required by the Code, pursuant to the rules under Section 16 of the
Exchange Act, by any national securities exchange or system on which the Stock
is then listed or reported, by any regulatory body having jurisdiction with
respect thereto or under any other applicable laws, rules or regulations.

     14.2 Awards Previously Granted.  No termination, amendment or modification
of the Plan other than pursuant to Section 4.4 herein shall in any manner
adversely affect any Award theretofore granted under the Plan, without the
written consent of the Participant.

                                  ARTICLE XV.
                                  Withholding

     15.1 Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the power and the right to
deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient to satisfy Federal, State and local taxes (including the
Participant's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to
any grant, exercise, or payment made under or as a result of this Plan.

     15.2 Stock Withholding.  With respect to withholding required upon the
exercise of Nonqualified Stock Options, or upon the lapse of restrictions on
Restricted Stock, or upon the occurrence of any other similar taxable event,
participants may elect, subject to the approval of the Committee, to satisfy the
withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold
Shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be
withheld.  The value of the Shares to be withheld shall be based on Fair Market
Value of the Shares on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be
determined.  All elections shall be irrevocable and be made in writing, signed
by the Participant on forms approved by the Committee in advance of the day that
the transaction becomes taxable.

                                  ARTICLE XVI.
                                   Successors

     All obligations of the Company under the Plan, with respect to Awards
granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the
existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and or assets of the Company.

                                 ARTICLE XVII.
                                    General

     17.1 Requirements of Law.  The granting of Awards and the issuance of
Shares of Stock under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules,
and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or SROs as
may be required.

     17.2 Effect of Plan.  The establishment of the Plan shall not confer upon
any Key Employee any legal or equitable right against the Company, a Subsidiary
or the Committee, except as expressly provided in the Plan.  The Plan does not
constitute an inducement or consideration for the employment of any Key
Employee, nor is it a contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Key Employee.  Participation in the Plan shall not give any Key Employee
any right to be retained in the service of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

     17.3 Creditors.  The interests of any Participant under the Plan or any
Agreement are not subject to the claims of creditors and may not, in any way, be
assigned, alienated or encumbered.

     17.4 Governing Law.  The Plan, and all Agreements hereunder, shall be
governed, construed and administered in accordance with and governed by the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the intention of the Company is that ISOs
granted under the Plan qualify as such under Section 422A of the Code.

     17.5 Severability.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect
the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as
if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

                                                                        9/8/94

                              September 21, 1993

Mr. Michael Dinkins
Chief Financial Officer
Cadmus Communications Corporation
6620 West Broad Street, Suite 500
Richmond, Virginia  23230


Dear Mr. Dinkins:


            Cadmus Communications Corporation (the "Corporation") considers it
essential to the best interests of its shareholders to foster the continuous
employment of its key management personnel.  In this connection, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a
change in control of the Corporation may exist and that such possibility, and
the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result
in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the
Corporation and its shareholders.

            The Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to
reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of
the Corporation's management, including yourself, to their assigned duties
without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances
arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Corporation.

            In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Corporation,
the Corporation agrees that you shall receive the severance benefits set forth
in this letter agreement (the "Agreement") in the event your employment with
the Corporation is terminated under the circumstances described below
subsequent to a Change in Control (as defined in Section 2) of the Corporation.

           1.   Certain Definitions.

          (a)   The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the
Change in Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change in
Control occurs.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if
a Change in Control occurs and if your employment with the Corporation is
terminated prior to the date on which the Change in Control occurs, and if it
is reasonably demonstrated by you that such termination of employment (i) was
at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to
effect the Change in Control, or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement
the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of
such termination of employment.

          (b)   The "Change in Control Period" shall mean the period commencing
on the date hereof and ending on the second anniversary of such date;
provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the date hereof,
and on each anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary
thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), the Change in
Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate two years
from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date the
Corporation shall give notice to you that the Change in Control Period shall
not be so extended.


           2.   Change in Control.  No benefits shall be payable hereunder
unless there shall have been a Change in Control of the Corporation, as set
forth below.  For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control shall mean:

          (a)   The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the
meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or
more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
Corporation (the "Outstanding Cadmus Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting
power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Cadmus Voting
Securities").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following acquisitions shall
not constitute a Change in Control:  (i) any acquisition directly from the
Corporation, (ii) any acquisition by the Corporation, (iii) any acquisition
by, or benefit distribution from, any employee benefit plan (or related trust)
sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or any corporation controlled by
the Corporation, (iv) any acquisition pursuant to any compensatory stock option
or stock purchase plan for employees, or (v) any acquisition pursuant to a
reorganization, merger or consolidation, if, following such reorganization,
merger or consolidation, the conditions described in clauses (i), (ii), and
(iii) of Subsection (c) of this Section 2 are satisfied; or

          (b)   Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board
(the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director
subsequent to the date hereof whose election or nomination for election was
approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the
Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of
the Incumbent Board (with his predecessor thereafter ceasing to be a member); or

          (c)   Approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of the
reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Corporation unless, following
such reorganization, merger, or consolidation, (i) more than 60% of the then
outstanding shares of common stock and the then outstanding voting securities
of the resulting corporation is then beneficially owned by all or substantially
all of the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Cadmus Common
Stock and Outstanding Cadmus Voting Securities immediately prior to such
reorganization, merger, or consolidation, (ii) no Person (excluding (A) the
Corporation, (B) any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the
Corporation or such corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger, or
consolidation, and (C) any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to
such reorganization, merger, or consolidation, 20% or more of the Outstanding
Cadmus Common Stock or Outstanding Cadmus Voting Securities, as the case may
be) beneficially owns 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of common
stock or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
of the resulting corporation, and (iii) at least a majority of the members of
the board of directors of the resulting corporation were members of the
Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement providing
for such reorganization, merger, or consolidation; or

          (d)   Approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of (i) a
complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation, or (ii) the sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation
other than to a corporation with respect to which, following such sale or other
disposition, (A) more than 60% of the outstanding shares of common stock and
the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation is beneficially
owned by all or substantially all of the beneficial owners, respectively, of
the Outstanding Cadmus Common Stock and Outstanding Cadmus Voting Securities
immediately prior to such sale or disposition; (B) no 
Person (excluding (I) the Corporation, (II) any employee benefit plan (or
related trust) of the Corporation or such corporation, and (III) any Person
beneficially owning, immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, 20%
or more of the Outstanding Cadmus Common Stock or Outstanding Cadmus Voting
Securities, as the case may be) beneficially owns 20% or more of the then
outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of such corporation, and (C) at least a majority
of the members of the board of directors of such corporation were members of
the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement
providing for such sale or other disposition of the assets of the corporation.


            3.  Employment Period.  The Corporation hereby agrees to continue,
or cause to be continued, your employment with the Corporation for the period
commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the second anniversary of such
date (the "Employment Period").

            4.  Termination.

          (a)   Your employment with the Corporation shall terminate
automatically upon your death during the Employment Period.

          (b)   If, as a result of your incapacity due to physical or mental
illness (as determined by the Corporation), you shall have been absent from
the full-time performance of your duties with the Corporation for six (6)
consecutive months (your "Disability"), the Corporation may give you written
notice of its intention to terminate your employment.  In such event, your
employment with the Corporation shall terminate effective on the 30th day
after your receipt of such notice (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided
that within 30 days after your receipt of such notice you have not returned to
full-time performance of your duties.

          (c)   The Corporation may terminate your employment during the
Employment Period for Cause.  For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall mean (i) the
willful and continued failure by you to substantially perform your duties with
the Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due
to physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure after
the issuance of a Notice of Termination (as defined in Section 4(e)) by you for
Good Reason (as defined in Section 4(d)), after a written demand for
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, which demand
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that you have
not substantially performed your duties, (ii) the willful engagement by you in
conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Corporation,
monetarily or otherwise, or (iii) your conviction of a felony involving moral
turpitude.  For purposes of this subsection, no act, or failure to act, on your
part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not
in good faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was
in the best interest of the Corporation.  

          (d)   You may terminate your employment with the Corporation during
the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Good
Reason" shall mean:

          (i)   the assignment to you of any duties inconsistent
      with the position (including status, offices, titles, and
      reporting requirements) or authority in the Corporation that
      you held immediately prior to the Change in Control, or a
      significant adverse alteration in the nature or status of
      your responsibilities or the conditions of your employment
      from those in effect immediately prior to such Change in
      Control;


         (ii)   a reduction by the Corporation in your annual base
      salary as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be
      increased from time to time;

        (iii)   the relocation of the Corporation's principal
      executive offices to a location outside the Richmond
      Metropolitan Area or the Corporation's requiring you to be
      based anywhere other than the Corporation's principal
      executive offices except for required travel on the
      Corporation's business to an extent substantially consistent
      with your present business travel obligations;

         (iv)   except in the event of reasonable administrative
      delay, the failure by the Corporation to pay to you any
      portion of your current compensation or to pay to you any
      portion of an installment of deferred compensation under any
      deferred compensation program of the Corporation within
      seven (7) days of the date such compensation is due;

          (v)   the failure by the Corporation to continue in
      effect any compensation plan in which you participate
      immediately prior to the Change in Control that is material
      to your total compensation or any substitute plans adopted
      prior to the Change in Control, unless an equitable
      arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute or
      alternative plan) has been made with respect to such plan, or
      the failure by the Corporation to continue your participation
      therein (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on a
      basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of the
      amount of benefits provided and the level of your
      participation relative to other participants, as it existed
      at the time of the Change in Control;

         (vi)   the failure by the Corporation to continue to
      provide you with benefits substantially similar to those
      enjoyed by you under any of the Corporation's life insurance,
      medical, health and accident, or disability plans in which
      you were participating at the time of the Change in Control,
      the taking of any action by the Corporation which would
      directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such benefits
      or deprive you of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by you
      at the time of the Change in Control, or the failure by the
      Corporation to provide you with the number of paid vacation
      days to which you are entitled on the basis of years of
      service with the Corporation in accordance with the
      Corporation's normal vacation policy in effect at the time of
      the Change in Control;

        (vii)   the failure of the Corporation to obtain a
      satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume and
      agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in Section 6
      hereof; or

       (viii)   any purported termination of your employment that
      is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination
      satisfying the requirements of subsection (e) hereof (and,
      if applicable, the requirements of Subsections (b) and (c)
      hereof), which purported termination shall not be effective
      for purposes of this Agreement.  


            For purposes of this subsection, any good faith determination of
"Good Reason" made by you shall be conclusive.  In addition, your right to
terminate your employment pursuant to this subsection shall not be affected by
your incapacity due to physical or mental illness and your continued employment
shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
circumstance constituting Good Reason hereunder.

          (e)   Any purported termination of your employment by the Corporation
or by you shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other
party hereto in accordance with Section 8.  For purposes hereof, "Notice of
Termination" shall mean a notice which (i) indicates the specific termination
provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your
employment under the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of
Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such
notice, specifies the termination date.  

          (f)   "Date of Termination" means (i) if your employment is
terminated by the Corporation for Cause or is terminated by you for Good
Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date
specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if your employment is terminated by
the Corporation other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination
shall be the date on which the Corporation notifies you of such termination,
and (iii) if your employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability,
the Date of Termination shall be the date of your death or the Disability
Effective Date, as the case may be.

           5.   Compensation upon Termination.  Following a Change in Control,
you shall be entitled to the following benefits upon termination of your
employment provided that such termination occurs during the Employment Period:

          (a)   If your employment is terminated by reason of your death during
the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further
obligations to your legal representatives under this Agreement, other than for
(i) payment of your Base Salary (as defined in Section 5(g) hereof) through the
Date of Termination at the same rate in effect at such date, and (ii) all other
amounts to which you are entitled under any compensation plan or any other
plan, policy, or arrangement of the Corporation, at the time such payments are
due.

          (b)   During any period that you fail to perform your full-time
duties with the Corporation as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental
illness, you shall continue to receive, until this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof, your Base Salary (as defined in Section 5(g))
at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with
all compensation payable to you under any long-term disability plan maintained
by the Corporation in your name or for your benefit or other similar plan
during such period.  Thereafter, your benefits shall be determined under the
Corporation's retirement, insurance and other compensation programs then in
effect in accordance with the terms of such program; however, your receipt of
benefits under any long-term disability plan maintained by the Corporation in
your name or for your benefit will not be affected by your termination under
this Agreement.

          (c)   If, during the Employment Period, your employment with the
Corporation shall be terminated by the Corporation for Cause or by you other
than for Good Reason, the Corporation shall pay you your full Base Salary (as
defined in Section 5(g)) through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect
at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other amounts to which
you are entitled under any compensation plan of the Corporation at the time 
such payments are due, and the Corporation shall have no further obligations
to you under this Agreement.

          (d)   If, during the Employment Period, your employment with the
Corporation shall be terminated by you for Good Reason or by the Corporation
other than for Cause, death, or Disability, then you shall be entitled to the
benefits provided below:

          (i)   the Corporation shall pay to you your full Base
      Salary (as defined in Section 5(g) hereof) through the Date
      of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
      Termination is given, no later than the fifth day  following
      the Date of Termination, plus all other amounts to which you
      are entitled under any compensation plan of the Corporation,
      at the time such payments are due;

         (ii)   in lieu of any further salary or bonus payments to
      you for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the
      Corporation shall pay as severance pay to you, at the time
      and in the manner specified in subsection (e), a severance
      payment (the "Severance Payment") equal to the product of (A)
      your Base Salary (as defined in Section 5(g) hereof), and (B)
      a number (the "Payment/Benefit Factor") determined by
      dividing by 52 the sum of (I) three times the number of full
      years that you have been employed by the Corporation, and
      (II) three times each $10,000 of your annual salary (that is,
      excluding bonus) as in effect at the Date of Termination;
      provided, however, that in no event shall such
      Payment/Benefit Factor be less than .5 nor greater than 2,
      and provided, further, that in no event shall such amount
      exceed the amount of your Base Salary (as defined in Section
      5(g)), on an undiscounted basis, which you would have
      received had you remained in the employ of the Corporation
      until your "Normal Retirement Date" (as defined in the
      Corporation's Pension Plan (or any successor thereto) (the
      "Pension Plan");

        (iii)   A separate lump-sum supplemental retirement benefit
      (the amount of such benefit shall be hereinafter referred to
      as the "Supplemental Retirement Amount") equal to the
      difference between (A) the actuarial equivalent (utilizing
      for this purpose the actuarial assumptions utilized in
      determining benefit cash-outs with respect to the
      Corporation's Pension Plan during the 90-day period
      immediately preceding the Effective Date) of the benefit
      payable under the Pension Plan and any supplemental and/or
      excess benefit plan of the Corporation providing benefits for
      you (the "SERP") which you would receive if your employment
      continued at the compensation level in effect at the Date of
      Termination for the remainder of the Employment Period,
      assuming for this purpose that all accrued benefits are
      fully vested and that benefit accrual formulas are no less
      advantageous to you than those in effect during the 90-day
      period immediately proceeding the Effective Date, and (B)
      the actuarial equivalent (utilizing for this purpose the
      actuarial assumptions utilized in determining benefit cash
      outs with respect to the Pension Plan during the 90-day
      period immediately preceding the Effective Date) of your
      actual vested benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the
      Pension Plan and the SERP;


         (iv)   Except as provided in (iii) above, your
      participation in, and terminating distribution and vested
      rights under, the Corporation's Pension Plan and other plans
      of deferred compensation shall be governed by the terms of
      those respective plans;

          (v)   the Corporation shall pay to you all legal fees and
      expenses incurred by you as a result of such termination,
      including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in
      seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by
      this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or
      proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of
      Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
      (the "Code") to any payment or benefit provided hereunder;

         (vi)   for a period of years (or portion thereof) (the
      "Payment Period") equal to the Payment/Benefit Factor after
      such termination or until your "Normal Retirement Date,"
      whichever first occurs, the Corporation shall arrange to
      provide you with life, disability, accident and group health
      insurance benefits substantially similar to those which you
      were receiving immediately prior to the Notice of
      Termination.  Benefits otherwise receivable by you pursuant
      to this clause (vi) shall be reduced to the extent comparable
      benefits are actually received by you from any source
      (including a subsequent employer) during such period
      following your termination, and any such benefits actually
      received by you shall be reported to the Corporation;

        (vii)   you shall not be entitled to payments or benefits
      under this Agreement to the extent (but only to the extent)
      that the sum of all payments and benefits received or to be
      received by you in connection with a Change in Control or the
      termination of your employment (whether pursuant to the
      terms of this Agreement ("Contract Payments") or any other
      plan, arrangement or agreement with the Corporation, any
      person whose actions result in a Change in Control, or any
      person affiliated with the Corporation or such person
      (collectively with the Contract Payments, "Total Payments"))
      would, as determined by tax counsel selected by the
      Corporation, result in "Excess Parachute Payments" as
      defined in Section 280G of the Code.  Furthermore, such
      payments or benefits provided to you under this Agreement
      shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion
      thereof shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section
      4999 of the Code, but only if, by reason of such reduction,
      your net after tax benefit shall exceed your net after tax
      benefit if such reduction were not made.  "Net after tax
      benefit" shall mean the sum of (A) all payments and benefits
      which you receive or are then entitled to receive from the
      Corporation that would constitute a "parachute payment"
      within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, less (B) the
      amount of federal income taxes payable with respect to the
      payments and benefits described in (A) above calculated at
      the maximum  marginal federal income tax rate for each year
      in which such payments and benefits shall be paid to you
      (based upon the rate in effect for such year as set forth in
      the Code at the time of the first payment of the foregoing),
      less (C) the amount of excise taxes imposed with respect to
      the payments and benefits described in (A) above by Section
      4999 of the Code; and


       (viii)   for a period of twelve (12) months following such
      termination, the Corporation shall pay the expenses of such
      outplacement services as you may require, with such services
      to be performed by such agency as the Corporation shall
      designate.

          (e)   The payment provided for in subsection (d)(ii), shall be made
in a lump-sum not later than the 30th day following the Date of Termination.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Subsection (e) or in subsection
(d)(ii), you may elect to receive, in lieu of a lump-sum Severance Payment, the
benefits described in subsection (d)(ii) in equal monthly installments
commencing on the first day of the month following the Date of Termination and
ending on the first to occur of (A) the first day of the last month within the
Payment Period, or (B) the first day of the month in which occurs your "Normal
Retirement Date";

          (f)   Except as provided in subsection (d)(vi) hereof you shall not
be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section
5 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment
or benefit provided for in this Section 5 be reduced by any compensation earned
by you as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement
benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by you to the
Corporation, or otherwise.

          (g)   For purposes of this Agreement, your "Base Salary" shall mean
the greater of (i) the annual salary and bonus paid to you by the Corporation
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, or (ii) the annual salary and bonus
payable to you by the Corporation during the fiscal year in which a Change in
Control occurs.

           6.   Successors:  Binding Agreement.  

          (a)   This Agreement is personal to you and without the prior written
consent of the Corporation shall not be assignable by you otherwise than by
will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, your legal representatives.

          (b)   This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the Corporation and its successors and assigns.

          (c)   The Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Corporation" shall
mean the Corporation as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business
and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement
by operation of law, or otherwise.

           7.   Resolution of Disputes.  If there shall be any dispute between
the Corporation and you (i) in the event of any termination of your employment
by the Corporation, whether such termination was for Cause, or (ii) in the
event of any termination of employment by you, whether Good Reason existed,
then, unless and until there is a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction declaring that such termination was for Cause or that
the determination by you of the existence of Good Reason was not made in good
faith, the Corporation shall pay all amounts, and provide all benefits, to you
and/or your family or other 
beneficiaries, as the case may be, that the Corporation would be required to
pay or provide pursuant to Section 5(d) as though such termination were by the
Corporation without Cause or by you with Good Reason; provided, however, that
the Corporation shall not be required to pay any disputed amounts pursuant to
this Section 7 except upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of you to
repay all such amounts to which you are ultimately adjudged by such court not
to be entitled.

           8.   Notice.  For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all
other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United
States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed to the respective addresses set forth on the first page of this
Agreement, provided that all notice to the Corporation shall be directed to the
attention of the Board with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation, or to
such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing
in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be
effective only upon receipt.

           9.   Miscellaneous.  

          (a)   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without reference to principles
of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of the
provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.

          (b)   The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement.

          (c)   The Corporation may withhold from any amounts payable under
this Agreement such Federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to be
withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

          (d)   Your or the Corporation's failure to insist upon strict
compliance with any provision hereof or any other provision of this Agreement
or the failure to assert any right you or the Corporation may have hereunder,
including, without limitation, your right to terminate your employment for Good
Reason pursuant to Section 4(d) or the Corporation's right to terminate your
employment for Cause pursuant to Section 4(c), shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this
Agreement.

          (e)   You and the Corporation acknowledge that, except as may
otherwise be provided under any other written agreement between you and the
Corporation, your employment by the Corporation is "at will" and if, prior to
the Effective Date, your employment with the Corporation terminates, then you
shall have no rights under this Agreement.

          (f)   Prior to the Effective Date, this Agreement may be amended,
modified or terminated by the Corporation, which amendment, modification or
termination shall be binding and effective without any requirement for
notification of, or consent by, you.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or
after the Effective Date, this Agreement may not be amended, modified or
terminated otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto
or their respective successors and legal representatives.

          10.   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire

                              September 21, 1993



Michael Dinkins
Chief Financial Officer
Cadmus Communications Corporation
6620 West Broad Street, Suite 500
Richmond, Virginia  23230

Dear Mr. Dinkins:

            On September 21, 1993, you and Cadmus Communications Corporation
(the "Corporation") entered into an agreement (a copy of which is attached
hereto) designed to reinforce and to encourage your continued attention and
dedication to your assigned duties without distraction by certain potentially
disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of
the Corporation (the "CIC Agreement").  All capitalized terms herein not
otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the CIC
Agreement.

            Pursuant to the CIC Agreement, you are entitled to receive certain
severance and other benefits in the event that, during the Employment Period
and following a Change in Control of the Corporation, your employment with the
Corporation shall be terminated by you for Good Reason or by the Corporation
other than for Cause, death, or Disability.  Those severance and other benefits
are set forth in, and conclusively fixed by, the express terms of the CIC
Agreements.

            The Corporation has determined, however, that it desires to augment
the Severance Payment otherwise payable to you under Section 5(d)(ii) of the
CIC Agreement.  Specifically, the Corporation shall pay to you a separate
lump-sum severance payment equal to the difference between (A) an amount equal
to two times your Base Salary, and (B) the amount payable to you pursuant to
Section 5(d)(ii) of the CIC Agreement.  The Corporation's intent is to provide
you, by means of a combination of Section 5(d)(ii) of the CIC Agreement and
this agreement, a severance payment equal to twice your Base Salary.

            The payment, if any, to be made hereunder shall be made in a
lump-sum not later than the 30th day following the Date of Termination;
provided, however that you may elect to receive said payment in equal monthly
installments commencing on the first day of the month following the Date of
Termination and ending on the first occur of (A) the first day of the last
month within the Payment Period or (B) the first day of the month in which
occurs your Normal Retirement Date.


            Please note that the payment, if any, to be made hereunder is
subject to the "cut-back" provisions of Section 5(d)(vii) of the CIC Agreement,
which provisions are expressly incorporated herein by reference.  In addition,
please note that this agreement will expire or terminate upon the earlier of
(i) December 31, 1996 or (ii) the expiration or termination of your CIC
Agreement according or pursuant to its terms.

            If this letter sets forth our agreement on the subject matter
hereof, kindly sign and return to the Corporation the enclosed of this letter,
which will then constitute our agreement on this subject.

                                    Sincerely,


                                    CADMUS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION


                                    By

CADMUS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(NET INCOME PER SHARE chart goes here)

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

    The Company believes that technological advancements in the graphic
communications industry will result in reduced demand for traditional printing.
The printers who will continue to be successful will be those who increase
their market share through improved productivity and expanded capabilities,
specialization in fast growing niche markets, and information integration. 

    The industry is in a difficult period of transition due to the accelerated
pace of both technological changes and shifts in market requirements. The
migration from analog to digital information, and the changes needed to target
and meet customer demands are major drivers of this transition. As customers
become more sophisticated and as they require more customization, printers must
redirect their focus to providing reduced run lengths, customization and
personalization, database management, and distribution channels. 

    Cadmus has begun its transition in the technological arena and is
positioning itself to offer integrated solutions to customer needs with
investments in state-of-the-art color prepress systems and text and graphics
composition equipment which are facilitating improvements in efficiency and
expanding the range of services available to customers.


OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

Fiscal year 1994 financial highlights include: 

    Sales increased 25.0% to $247.7 million. 
    Excluding the $1.9 million restructuring charge, operating income rose
    30.6% to $14.8 million.
    Operating income after the restructuring charge rose to $12.9 million, a
    13.9% increase. 
    Net income climbed 40.0% to $6.3 million, or $1.05 per share, excluding the
    restructuring charge. 
    Net income after the restructuring charge was up 14.9% to $5.2 million, or
    $.86 per share. 
    The operating income return on average total capital improved from 11.7% in
    fiscal 1993 to 13.8% before the restructuring charge, after the
    restructuring charge it was 12.0%.

    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company announced reductions in
its work force resulting from a decision to restructure the research journal and
specialty magazine divisions at a cost of $1.9 million. 

    In the second quarter of fiscal 1994, Cadmus acquired the net assets of
Waverly Press from Waverly, Inc. Waverly Press, formerly the printing division
of Waverly, Inc., is a Maryland-based printer of scientific, technical, medical,
and scholarly journals, which now operates under the name Cadmus Journal
Services. By combining the strengths and assets of two of the leading journal
producers in the country, we are able to significantly improve the level of
service, as well as the nature of the products offered to journal publishers. As
part of the transaction, Waverly, Inc. agreed to enter into a long-term printing
agreement with Cadmus Journal Services, which will assure important continuity
between the two companies.

    During the second quarter of fiscal 1993, Cadmus acquired Marblehead
Communications, Inc., a Boston-based contract/custom publisher. Also, in the
third quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company completed a joint venture arrangement
with the Lanman Companies, Inc. ("Lanman"). The newly-formed company, Central
Florida Press, L.C. ("CFP"), combined the operations of Vaughan Printers, Inc.,
a Cadmus subsidiary, and Central Florida Press, a division of Lanman, and now
offers both sheetfed and half-web print capabilities to its customers. This
combination strengthened the Company's market position in central Florida and
contributed positive earnings in 1994.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
SALES

Net sales were $247.7 million in fiscal 1994, a 25.0% increase over fiscal 1993
net sales of $198.1 million, which were up 5.4% over fiscal 1992 net sales of
$188.0 million. The Company classifies its sales into three business groups:
printing, marketing, and publishing. 

    Sales increased in each business group for fiscal 1994 compared with fiscal
1993 as follows: printing 22.9%, marketing 11.8%, and publishing 76.3%. The
increase in printing sales for fiscal 1994 was the result of increased research
journal sales due primarily to the fiscal 1994 acquisition of Cadmus Journal
Services, a 30.8% growth in sales of specialty packaging and a 55.2% increase in
annual report sales. In addition, specialty magazines posted a 4.4% increase for
the year after reporting a fiscal 1993 decline which resulted from competitive
pricing pressures. These increases were partially offset by a 16.2% decline in
promotional printing sales and a 4.0% decline in financial printing sales.
Promotional sales were down primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of
Vaughan sales through the merger with CFP in the third quarter of fiscal 1993.
Also, financial printing sales were down due to increased competition in the
Charlotte, Baltimore, and Richmond markets and unfavorable comparisons due to a
large one-time job in fiscal 1993. Adjusted for the acquisition of Cadmus
Journal Services and the merger of Vaughan, printing sales increased 4.9% over
fiscal 1993. 

    The increase in marketing sales for fiscal 1994 resulted from growth of
43.2% in direct marketing sales and growth of 13.5% in point-of-sale revenues.
The increase in direct marketing revenues was attributable to growth in sales to
existing clients and a refocus of the direct marketing operations on higher
margin product lines. Point-of-sale revenues grew as a result of developing
relationships with new customers, coupled with growth in existing accounts.
These increases were partially offset by a 9.6% decline in catalog production
services sales due to the loss of a major account in January 1993. 

    The notable increase in publishing sales for fiscal 1994 was the result of
the inclusion and expansion of Marblehead (acquired December 1992), coupled with
continued growth of Tuff Stuff.Expansion at Marblehead resulted in an increase
of 78.4% over prior year annualized sales due to both additions of new accounts
and increased sales to existing customers.

    The decline in printing sales from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993 was due
primarily to lower sales of specialty magazines (1.0% decrease) and research
journals (5.4% decrease) which continued to face competitive pricing pressures,
offset in part by the continued strength in sales of financial printing (27.7%
increase) and specialty packaging (85.1% increase). The increase in marketing
sales during fiscal 1993 was primarily attributable to an increase of 20.5% in
point-of-sale revenues, which offset a 9.6% decline in direct marketing sales.
For fiscal 1993, the dramatic increase over fiscal 1992 in publishing sales
reflects a full year of Tuff Stuff sales and the midyear acquisition of
Marblehead. 

(Gross Profit Margin chart goes here)

GROSS PROFIT

In fiscal 1994, gross profit was 27.1% of sales compared with 27.9% and 26.0%
in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively. Gross profit declined slightly in fiscal
1994 as a result of a change in the sales mix due to the addition of Cadmus
Journal Services, which has a relatively lower gross margin, and due to a
decline in high margin financial printing sales. Excluding Cadmus Journal
Services, the gross margin was 28.4%. 

    Improvement in gross profit as a percent of sales from fiscal 1992 to 1993
was credited to improved product mix, a result of increased sales of higher
margin financial printing, point-of-sales printing, and specialty packaging.
These improvements were partially offset by continued competitive pricing
pressures; the write-off of inventory related to SIDELINES, a coffee table book
which was marketed under a license from the National Football League; and higher
health care costs.


                                                                             21

(SELLING AND ADMINISTRATION chart goes here)

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

    Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 21.1%, 22.2%,
and 20.5% in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The decrease in selling
and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the
inclusion in fiscal 1994 of Cadmus Journal Services, which had a lower selling
and administrative expense ratio of 12.2%.

    During fiscal 1993, selling and administrative expenses rose at a slightly
higher pace than sales primarily due to the full-year inclusion of Tuff Stuff
and the midyear acquisition of Marblehead, our two publishing operations, which
as mentioned earlier have a higher selling and administrative expense ratio, and
due to the expenses related to SIDELINES. In addition, increased costs
associated with management incentive programs, due to substantially improved
performance, and increased health care costs contributed to the rise in selling
and administrative expenses.


RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company announced a plan to
restructure its research journal and specialty magazine divisions, resulting in
a pre-tax charge to earnings of $1.9 million. This charge resulted from
reductions in its work force related to the decisions to close its Springfield,
Virginia facility, and to consolidate its composition and prepress facilities in
Richmond and Baltimore. The Company expects to achieve pre-tax cost savings of
approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 1995, with a full-year impact of annual
cost savings increasing to $3.2 million in fiscal 1996. This restructuring
charge reduced 1994 income before taxes, net income, and net income per share by
$1.9 million, $1.1 million and $.19, respectively.

OPERATING INCOME, OTHER EXPENSES, AND INCOME TAXES

    Operating income before the restructuring charge improved to 6.0% of sales
for fiscal 1994 from 5.7% in fiscal 1993, and 5.5% in fiscal 1992. Operating
income as a percent of sales after the restructuring charge was 5.2% in fiscal
1994. 

    Interest expense increased slightly from 1.6% and 1.7% of sales in fiscal
1993 and 1992, respectively to 1.9% of sales in fiscal 1994 due primarily to a
$1.1 million increase in interest expense and a $.5 million decrease in
capitalized interest. The higher interest expense was associated with increased
levels of debt required to fund the purchase of Cadmus Journal Services. 

    Other expenses decreased to 0.1% of sales in fiscal 1994 from 0.3% and 0.4%
in fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively, This decline is primarily due to the full
year impact in fiscal 1994 of earnings from the CFP joint venture. 

    Effective income tax rates have remained relatively stable over the past
three years at 39.4% in fiscal 1994 and 1993, and 39.5% in fiscal 1992.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

    Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The Company elected to 
immediately recognize the liability for prior years' service as the cumulative 
effect of a change in accounting principle. Accordingly, the Company recorded 
an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and a corresponding charge
to net income of $.9 million, and a non-current deferred income tax benefit 
of $.4 million, resulting in an after-tax charge of $.5 million. 

    The Company also adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
effective July 1, 1993, which requires the liability method of accounting for
deferred income taxes, whereby enacted statutory tax rates are applied to the 
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change was a reduction in the 
deferred income tax liability and a corresponding increase in net income
of $.9 million.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    During fiscal 1994, the Company experienced significant improvement in cash
flow performance. Net cash provided by operating activities rose to $26.0
million from $10.4 million in fiscal 1993. This gain was primarily attributable
to a 40.0% increase in income before the restructuring charge, higher
depreciation and amortization expense, and a $11.7 million reduction in
operating assets and liabilities. The $1.8 million increase in depreciation and
amortization expense was due to additions of property, plant and equipment, both
through the acquisition of Cadmus Journal Services and through capital
investments made for strategic expansion and reinvestment. The reduction in
operating assets and liabilities was credited to improved paper inventory
management and more aggressive utilization of trade credit. 

    The increase in fiscal 1994 in net cash used in investing activities of
$17.6 million and the increase in net cash provided by financing activities of
$3.5 million are both primarily a result of transactions related to the
acquisition of Cadmus Journal Services. Cash paid or placed in escrow for this
acquisition of $19.7 million and capital investments of $11.2 million account
for the majority of

the investing activities. In 1993, cash used in investing activities
included $2.2 million related to the investment in the CFP joint venture, as
well as $10.7 million in capital investments. The financing activities in fiscal
1994 include proceeds from the placement of $40.0 million in senior notes and
the repayment of $32.0 million in term loans and long-term debt. In fiscal 1993,
cash provided by financing activities of $3.2 million resulted from increased
borrowings under bank lines of credit of $7.0 million and the repayment of long-
term debt of $2.4 million.

    Capital investment in property, plant and equipment totaled $11.2 million
during fiscal 1994. Significant projects included in this amount were the

purchase of new composition software to integrate text and graphics for research
journals and the rebuilding of a six-unit web press. Other significant capital
investments included the purchase of a six-unit sheetfed press and the
installation of a financial network. In addition, the Company entered into two
long-term operating leases during the year, one for a new six-unit sheetfed
press and one for an eight-unit half-web press. For fiscal 1995, the Company
projects that capital spending will total approximately $14.3 million. This
amount includes commitments of $3.2 million made in fiscal 1994. 

    Total debt at June 30, 1994 was $58.4 million, representing an increase of
$7.9 million from the $50.5 million at June 30, 1993. The Company's debt-to-
capital ratio at June 30, 1994 was 51.5% compared with 49.9% at June 30, 1993.
This increase was primarily due to additional debt incurred to purchase the net
assets of Cadmus Journal Services. On December 23, 1993, the Company placed $40
million of senior notes with two insurance companies. The proceeds from these
notes were used to repay short-term bridge loans incurred to finance the asset
purchase of Cadmus Journal Services, short-term revolving bank lines of credit,
and a bank term loan. These senior notes, which have an average life of 8.1years
with a final maturity of 10 years, carry a fixed interest rate of 6.74%.
Coincidental with the placement of the senior notes, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert $35 million of the senior
notes to floating rate debt. The Company also entered into agreements with four
banks on February 14, 1994, for a $25 million revolving credit facility. There
were no outstanding borrowings against these revolving credit lines at June 30,
1994. See Note 8of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on these transactions.

CADMUS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


(Dollars and shares in thousands, except per-share data) 


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of Cadmus Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries
("Cadmus"), including its unconsolidated fifty percent owned equity investment.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION. Substantially all printing, marketing, and publishing
products are produced to customer specifications. Upon completion of
manufacturing, products are shipped and revenue is recorded. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.


INVENTORIES. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, principally
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (73% in 1994 and 69% in 1993). The
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method is used to value the remaining inventories.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated principally by the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives. The cost and accumulated
depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the
respective accounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in other expenses,
net. 

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES. Goodwill and intangibles include the costs in excess
of net assets of businesses acquired and other valued intangibles and are being
amortized by the straight-line method over 20 years. Accumulated amortization
was $3,278 and $2,728 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

INCOME TAXES. Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires the liability method of
accounting for deferred income taxes, whereby enacted statutory tax rates are
applied to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities (see Note 9). The Company had previously accounted for
income taxes in accordance with the method prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 11. 

EARNINGS PER SHARE. Earnings per share is computed on the basis of weighted
average common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares in the form of
stock options. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 1994 presentation.


2. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company recorded a restructuring
charge of $1.9 million. This charge resulted from reductions in its work force
related to the decision to close its Springfield, Virginia facility and to
consolidate its composition and prepress facilities in Richmond and Baltimore.
These actions are expected to be completed by June 30, 1995. The Company
recorded a pretax charge of $1.6 million related to termination benefits and
anticipates layoffs of approximately 96 employees: 20% management and 80%
production. The remaining charges relate to equipment write-offs and
miscellaneous other direct costs associated with the discontinuation of the
operations and other exit costs. This restructuring charge reduced 1994 income
before taxes, net income, and net income per share by $1.9 million, $1.1
million and $.19, respectively. 

3. ACQUISITION OF CADMUS JOURNAL SERVICES

On November 1, 1993, the Company acquired the net assets of Waverly Press from
Waverly, Inc. for approximately $20 million. Waverly Press, the printing
division of Waverly, Inc., had annual sales of approximately $50 million, now
operating under the name Cadmus Journal Services, is well-known as a premier
printer of scientific, technical, medical, and scholarly journals. The purchase
price consisted of cash payments of $14.5 million at closing; additional
consideration of $5.5 million which is contingent upon confirmation of certain
representations made by Waverly, Inc. regarding Waverly Press and certain
contingencies relating to the calendar 1994 operations; and other direct costs
of the acquisition. The funds used to acquire Cadmus Journal Services were
provided from the placement of senior notes with two insurance companies (see
Note 8). The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method and,
accordingly, the costs of the acquisition were allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The operating
results of Cadmus Journal Services have been included in the consolidated
operating results since the date of acquisition. 

Of the $5.5 million contingent consideration, $1 million was placed in escrow at
closing in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and is included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as other assets. During fiscal 1994, contingencies
of $3.5 million expired which resulted in a $2.5 million (plus interest) labor
contingency payment and a $.4 million balance sheet guarantee payment made on
April 8, 1994 and January 6, 1994, respectively. As additional contingent
payments are made, if any, the costs allocated to the noncurrent assets will be
increased proportionately. 

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information combines
the results of Cadmus Journal Services as if they had been acquired as of the
beginning of the periods presented. Fiscal 1994 results include the $1.9 million
restructuring charge ($1.1 million after tax or $.19 per share) and both periods
presented include the impact of the following adjustments: depreciation of the
assets acquired based on


                                                                            27

their fair values, elimination of Waverly, Inc. corporate overhead allocation,
savings due to consolidation and elimination of duplicative services, interest
expense on debt used to fund the purchase, and the related income tax effect of
these adjustments.

</TABLE>

The current cost of inventories exceeded the LIFO value of inventories by $1,578
and $1,925 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. During 1994, inventory
quantities were reduced resulting in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities
carried at lower costs which prevailed in prior years as compared with the cost
of current purchases. The effect of the inventory reduction increased net income
by $210. There were no significant reductions of inventories in fiscal 1993 and
1992.


5. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993

June 30, 1994 totaled $3,217. On June 30, 1994, the Company entered into an
agreement of purchase and sale for its Three Score property in Tucker, Georgia.
The terms of this agreement call for Three Score to sell its real property for
approximately $3.0 million and to enter into a 15 year lease consisting of
average annual payments of $350. 

The Company leases office, production and storage space and equipment under
various noncancellable operating leases. A number of leases contain renewal
options and some contain purchase options. Certain leases require the Company to
pay utilities, taxes and other operating expenses.

1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Substantially all such rental expense

rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining
noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of June 30, 1994 are as
follows: 1995 - $2,144; 1996 -$2,276; 1997 - $2,217; 1998 - $2,194; 1999 -
$2,098; thereafter -$4,945.

investment is accounted for on an equity basis. Equity income from
unconsolidated joint venture totaled $330 and $76 for fiscal years 1994 and

Hedging activities increased interest expense by $493, $494 and $333 in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively. 

The Company completed placement of $40 million in senior notes with two
insurance companies on December 23, 1993. The placement has a fixed interest
rate of 6.74% with an average life of 8.1 years and is due in 2003. The proceeds
of this placement were used to fund the acquisition of Cadmus Journal Services
and to refinance approximately $20 million of revolving bank credit and term
loans.

The Company also entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreement
with a notional value of $35 million to convert that amount of the 2003 senior
notes to floating rate debt. This swap has an initial term of three years which
is renewable at the bank's option for an additional two years. Under the terms
of this agreement, the Company makes payments at variable rates which are based
on six-month LIBOR and receives payments at a fixed interest rate of 5.265%. The
net interest paid or received is included in interest expense. The Company is
exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to
the interest swap agreement. The agreements are with major financial
institutions which are expected to fully perform under the terms of the
agreements thereby mitigating the credit risk from the transactions. The
variable rate at June 30, 1994 was 5.125%. 

During 1994, the Company entered into agreements for revolving credit facilities
aggregating $25 million with its four major banks, replacing the former lines of
credit. These new unsecured, committed lines of credit have a three-year term
expiring in February 1997, at which time


                                                                 29
<PAGE>

any loans outstanding under the facility convert to term loans with a two-year
maturity. The Company has the following interest rate options: (i) adjusted CD
rate or (ii) adjusted LIBOR. These agreements also require commitment fees of 
1/4 to 1/2 percent per annum on any unused portion of the lines of credit.

To fix the rate on $10 million of the variable rate term loans discussed above,
Cadmus entered into interest rate swap agreements in 1990 which expire in
December 1995. The swap agreements effectively converted these variable rate
borrowings into fixed rate obligations with a fixed rate of 9.01%. Under the
terms of these agreements, the Company makes payments at a fixed interest rate
of 8.34% and receives payments at variable rates which are based on LIBOR. The
net interest paid or received is included in interest expense. In 1994, Cadmus
repaid the balance of term loans and has utilized these swap agreements as a
hedge against the $35 million floating rate swap mentioned above. At June 30,
1994, the fair value of this contract was ($264). The $9.1 million notional
value of the swap contracts does not represent exposure to credit loss. In the
event of default by the counterparties, the risk, if any, in these transactions
is the cost of replacing the swap agreement at current market rates. The Company
continually monitors its positions and the credit rating of its counterparties
and limits the amount of agreements it enters into with any one party.
Management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties; however, if
incurred, any such loss would be immaterial.

Under the terms of the various debt instruments, approximately $37 million of
the retained earnings at June 30, 1994, is not available for payment of cash
dividends. 

Maturities of long-term debt for the five years ending June 30, 1999, are as

follows: 1995 - $2,321; 1996 - $2,293; 1997 - $3,589; 1998 - $5,164; 1999 -
$6,940. The book value of all encumbered properties as of June 30, 1994, totaled
$720. 

The Company incurred interest of $4,814, $3,683 and $3,835 for the years 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively, of which $1, $450 and $587 were capitalized.
Interest paid, net of amounts capitalized, totaled $4,789, $3,193 and $3,293 for
the years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 


9. INCOME TAXES

Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting 
for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires the liability method of
accounting for deferred income taxes, whereby enacted statutory tax rates are
applied to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle was a reduction in the deferred income tax liability and a
corresponding increase in net income of $933 in the first quarter of 1994. Under
the provisions of SFAS 109, the Company elected not to restate prior years'
consolidated financial statements. 

A summary of income tax expense (benefit) included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income follows:

                    1994          1993          1992

Cash paid for income taxes totaled $3,000, $2,305 and $3,387 for 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively. The sources of temporary timing differences resulting in
deferred income taxes and the tax effect of each were as follows:

                                 1994          1993            1992

</TABLE>

The net current and non-current components of deferred income taxes recognized
in the balance sheet at June 30, 1994, are as follows: net current assets of
$1,227, and net non-current liabilities of $2,922, resulting in a net liability
of $1,695.

The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately
$11.7 million which expire during fiscal years 2004 to 2009. A valuation
allowance of $237 has been established for state net operating loss benefits
that are not expected to be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by $137
from the beginning of the year. 

The tax effects of the significant temporary differences which comprise the
deferred tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 1994, reflecting the adoption
of SFAS Nos. 106 and 109 are as follows:

10. RETIREMENT PLANS

Retirement benefits are provided to substantially all employees principally
through a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan ("Core Plan") and a
thrift savings plan. The Core Plan is a defined benefit plan and benefits are
based on the plan provisions relating to employees' compensation and years of
service. Assets under the plans consist of marketable securities and are held
in trust funds managed by independent investment advisors. These plans are
qualified plans under the Internal Revenue Code. The policy of the Company is
to fund the Core plan at amounts not less than the minimum requirements of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. A supplementary non-qualified,
non-funded, pension plan ("Supplemental Plan") for certain officers is also
maintained and is being provided for by charges to earnings sufficient to meet
the projected benefit obligation. The pension cost for this plan is based on
substantially the same actuarial assumptions as those used for the Core Plan. 

The components of net pension costs follow:

</TABLE>

*The Supplemental Plan is technically a non-funded plan; however, the Company
has acquired life insurance contracts ($13,888 and $12,779 face amount at 
June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively) intended to be adequate to fund future
benefits. The cash surrender value of these contracts, net of policy loans, 
was $3,638 and $3,251 at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and is included 
in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Because of the Core Plan's over-funded status, no contributions were made in
1994, 1993 or 1992. 

The thrift savings plan enables employees to save a portion of their earnings on
a tax-deferred basis and also provides for matching contributions from the
Company for a portion of the employees' savings. Additionally, the plan provides
for individual subsidiary companies to make profit sharing contributions. The
Company's expense under this plan was $1,148, $1,001 and $980 for 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively. 


11. OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

All employees of the Company are eligible for retiree medical coverage if they
retire on or after attaining age 55 with ten or more years of service. Benefits
differ depending upon the date of retirement. For those employees who retired
prior to April 1, 1988, and are under 65, coverage is available at a cost to
the retiree equal to the cost to Cadmus for an active employee less the fixed
company subsidy. Once employees in this group have reached 65, coverage is
available at a cost to the retiree equal to the cost to Cadmus for a post-65
retiree less the fixed company subsidy. 

For those employees who retired on or after April 1, 1988 but before January 1,
1994, coverage is available until the earlier of the death of the retiree or
attainment of age 65. The retiree contributes the full active rate. Upon
reaching 65, coverage under the Cadmus plan ceases and the retiree becomes
covered by Medicare. For those employees who retire on or after January 1, 1994,
coverage is available until the earlier of the death of the retiree, or
attainment of age 65. The retiree contributes the full retiree rate, which is
equal to the cost to Cadmus for a pre-65 retired employee. Upon reaching 65,
coverage under the Cadmus plan ceases and the retiree becomes covered by
Medicare.

Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions." SFAS No. 106 requires recognition of the cost of
postretirement benefits during the employees' service periods. Previously, such
expenses were accounted for on a cash basis. The Company elected to immediately
recognize the liability for prior years' service as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 1994,
Cadmus recorded an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and a
corresponding charge to net income of $887 and a noncurrent deferred income tax
benefit of $355, resulting in an after-tax charge of $532. This is an unfunded
plan. 


The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) of $938 existing at
July 1, 1993 consisted of: retirees and beneficiaries of $544, spouses of
retirees of $197, and active eligible employees of $197.

32

<PAGE>

The net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1994 was $69, consisting solely of interest costs. The discount rate used in
determining the APBO was 8%. A 13% rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits was assumed for 1994, with the rates gradually
decreasing to 5.5% in the year 2003 and remaining level thereafter. A one
percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would
increase the APBO approximately 2.4% or $22.

On February 1, 1989, as part of a shareholder rights plan, the Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right
for each outstanding share of common stock. Each right entitles the shareholder
to buy one unit (one one-thousandth of a share) of Series A Preferred Stock at a
purchase price of $45 per share, subject to adjustment. The rights will become
exercisable initially only if a person or group acquires or announces a tender
offer for 20% or more of Cadmus common stock ("Acquiring Person"), at which time
each right will be exercisable to purchase one unit of Series A Preferred at the
purchase price. At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, Cadmus
may issue a share of common stock in exchange for each right other than those
held by the Acquiring Person. If an Acquiring Person acquires 30% or more of
Cadmus common stock or an Acquiring Person merges into or combines with Cadmus,
each right will entitle the holder, other than the Acquiring Person, upon
payment of the purchase price, to acquire Series A Preferred or, at the option
of Cadmus, common stock, having a market value equal to twice the purchase
price. If Cadmus is acquired in a merger or other business combination in which
it does not survive or if 50% of its earnings power is sold, each right will
entitle the holder, other than the Acquiring Person, to purchase securities of
the surviving company having a market value equal to twice the purchase price.
Unless redeemed earlier, the rights expire on February 13, 1999. The rights may
be redeemed by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the tenth day after a
person becomes an Acquiring Person, subject to the Board of Directors' ability
to extend or reinstate the redemption period under certain circumstances. The
rights may have certain antitakeover effects. An Acquiring Person will
experience substantial dilution under certain circumstances. However, the rights
should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by
the Board of Directors because the rights are generally redeemable at the
discretion of the Board. 

The Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to 200 shares of Cadmus
stock from time to time on the open market. The shares, if and when purchased,
may be used for the funding of employee benefit plans. As of June 30, 1994, 131
shares had been repurchased and retired under this authorization. 

In addition to its common stock, Cadmus authorized capital includes 1,000 shares
of preferred stock ($1.00 par), issuable in series, of which 100 shares are
designated as Series A Preferred. 


13. STOCK OPTIONS Under the Cadmus stock option plans, selected employees may
be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at prices equal to the
fair market value of the stock at the date the options are granted. There are no
charges to earnings resulting from the plan.



                                                                    33

</TABLE>

At June 30, 1994, 769 shares of authorized but unissued common stock were
reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted or grantable under the
plans. Options are exercisable under the plans for periods of five to ten years
from the date of grant. 


14. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk
consist principally of trade receivables (primarily customers in the
publishing, retail store and advertising industries) for which collateral is
generally not required. The Company carefully monitors the extension of credit,
including the amount due from any one customer. 


15. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

The principal noncash investing and financing activities excluded from the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended June 30, 1993 are the
$1,500 assumption of liabilities in connection with one of the Company's
acquisitions and the receipt of a $350 note receivable in exchange for certain
assets. There were no noncash investing or financing activities in fiscal 1994.



16. ROYALTY COMMITMENTS

On March 1, 1994, the Company entered into a three-year royalty agreement with
National Football League Properties, Inc. ("NFLP") for manufacturing,
publishing, and distributing a sports publication with minimum annual
guaranteed royalty payments averaging $550. 


17. CONTINGENCIES

The Company is a party to various legal actions which are ordinary and
incidental to its business. While the outcome of legal actions cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Company believes the outcome of any of these
proceedings, or all of them combined, will not have a materially adverse effect
on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 



CADMUS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors, Cadmus Communications
Corporation: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cadmus
Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries ("Cadmus") as of June 30, 1994 and
1993, and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1994. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cadmus
as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 

As discussed in Notes 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective as of the beginning of 1994, Cadmus changed its method of accounting
for income taxes to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 and its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.
