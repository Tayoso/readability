                             PART I


ITEM 1.  BUSINESS:

     Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1969, together
with its subsidiaries, hereinafter set forth, (the "Company" or
"Unifi"), is engaged predominantly in the business of processing
yarns by:  texturing of synthetic filament polyester and nylon
fiber; and spinning of cotton and cotton blend fibers.

     The Company's texturing operation mainly involves purchasing
partially oriented yarn (POY), which is either raw polyester or
nylon filament fiber, from chemical manufacturers and using high
speed machines to draw, heat and twist the POY to produce yarns
having various physical characteristics, depending upon its
ultimate end-use.  The Company's spinning operation mainly involves
the spinning on either open-end or ring equipment of cotton, cotton
and undyed synthetic blends, and cotton and pre-dyed polyester
blends into yarns of different strengths and thickness.

     The Company currently sells textured polyester yarns, nylon
yarns, dyed yarns, covered yarns, spun yarns made of cotton, cotton
and un-dyed synthetic blends, and cotton and pre-dyed polyester
blends domestically and internationally to weavers and knitters who
produce fabrics for the apparel, industrial, hosiery, home
furnishing, auto upholstery, activewear, and underwear markets.

     On August 18, 1993, the Company concluded an agreement with
the principals of Pioneer Yarn Mills, Inc., Pioneer Spinning, Inc.,
Edenton Cotton Mills, Inc., and Pioneer Cotton Mill, Inc., (the
"Pioneer Corporations"), all of which are affiliated privately-held
North Carolina corporations, where through a Triangular Merger, the
Pioneer Corporations would merge into Unifi Spun Yarns, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Unifi ("USY").  The Pioneer
Corporations' primary products included spun yarns made solely of
cotton, although two of the Pioneer Corporations' plants have or
will have the capability of adding synthetic blends.

     The Company, internationally, has manufacturing facilities in
Letterkenny, County Donegal, Republic of Ireland, which texturizes
polyester, as well as producing its own polymer (POY).









                               I-1


           SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS:

     A.  POY.  The primary suppliers of POY to the Company are E.
I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Hoechst Celanese Corporation, and
Wellman Industries, with the majority of the Company's POY being
supplied by DuPont.  Although the Company is heavily dependent upon
a limited number of suppliers, the Company has not had and does not
anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining its raw POY.

     B.  Cotton.  The Company buys its cotton, which is a commodity
and is traded on established markets, from brokers such as Dunavant
Enterprises, HoHenBerg Brothers Co., Staple Cotton, and Stahel
(America).  The Company has not had and does not anticipate any
material difficulty in obtaining cotton.

     PATENTS AND LICENSES:  The Company currently has several
patents and registered trademarks, including the following:

     The Company does not have any patents, trademarks, licenses,
or franchises which are material to its business as a whole.

     CUSTOMERS:  The Company in fiscal year ended June 26, 1994,
sold textured and spun yarns to approximately 1,000 customers, one
customer's purchases were approximately 12% of the net sales during
said period, the ten largest customers accounted for approximately
30% of the total sales and the Company does not believe that it is
dependent on any one customer.

     BACKLOG:  The Company, other than in connection with certain
foreign sales and for textured yarns that are package dyed
according to customers' specifications, does not manufacture to
order.  The Company's products can be used in many ways and can be
thought of in terms of a commodity subject to the laws of supply 
and demand and, therefore, does not have what is considered a
backlog of orders.  In addition, the Company does not consider its
products to be seasonal ones.

















                               I-3
     COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS:  The textile industry in which the
Company currently operates is keenly competitive.  The Company
processes and sells high-volume commodity products, pricing is
highly competitive with product quality and customer service being
essential for differentiating the competitors within the industry. 
Product quality insures manufacturing efficiencies for the
customer.  The Company's polyester and nylon yarns, dyed yarns, 
covered yarns and cotton and cotton blend yarns compete with a
number of other domestic producers of such yarns.  In the sale of
polyester filament yarns major competitors are Atlas Yarn Company,
Inc., Burlington Industries, Inc. and Milliken & Company, in the
sale of nylon yarns, dyed yarns, and covered yarns major
competitors are Glen Raven Mills, Inc., Jefferson Mills, Inc.,
Spanco Yarns, Inc., Regal Manufacturing Company and Spectrum Dyed
Yarns, Inc., and in the sale of cotton and cotton blend yarns major
competitors are Parkdale Mills, Inc., Avondale Mills, Inc.,
Harriett & Henderson, Mayo Yarns, Inc. and TNS Mills, Inc..

     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT:  The estimated amount spent during
each of the last three fiscal years on Company-sponsored and
Customer-sponsored research and development activities is
considered immaterial.

     COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS:  Management of
the Company believes that the operation of the Company's production
facilities and the disposal of waste materials are substantially in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

     EMPLOYEES:  The number of employees of the Company is
approximately 6,000 full-time employees.

     FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES:  The information included under the
heading "Business Segments and Foreign Operations" on page 19 of
the Annual Report of the Company to the Shareholders for the fiscal
year ended June 26, 1994, is incorporated herein by reference.  In
addition, on September 9, 1994, the Company completed the sale of
its wholly-owned French subsidiary, Unifi Texturing, S.A. ("UTSA")

          THIRD:  The office of the Corporation is to be located in       
     the City, County and State of New York.

          FOURTH:  The aggregate number of shares of capital stock 
     which the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 
     five hundred million shares, all of which are to consist of 
     one class of common stock only of the par value of $.10 each.

          FIFTH:  The Secretary of State is designated as the agent       
      of the Corporation, upon whom process against it may be 
     served, and the post office address to which the Secretary of 
     State shall mail a copy of any process against the Corporation       
     served upon him is:

               c/o KREINDLER & RELKIN, P.C.
               Attn:  Donald L. Kreindler, Esquire
               Empire State Building
               350 Fifth Avenue, 65th Floor
               New York, New York 10118.

          SIXTH:  No holder of any shares of any class of the 
     Corporation shall as such holder have any pre-emptive right or       
     be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or to 
     purchase any other shares or securities of any class which at 
     any time may be sold or offered for sale by the Corporation.

          SEVENTH:  The number of Directors shall be fixed in the 
     By-Laws but in no case shall be less than nine (9), but this 
     number may be increased and subsequently increased or 
     decreased from time to time by the affirmative vote of the 
     majority of the Board, except that the number of Directors 
     shall not be less than nine (9).  The Directors shall be 
     divided into three classes designated as Class 1, Class 2 and 
     Class 3.  Each class shall be as nearly equal in number as 
     possible and no class shall include less than three (3) 
     Directors.  The term of office of the Directors initially 
     classified shall be as follows:  Class 1 shall expire at the 
     next (1992) Annual Meeting of the Shareholders,  Class 2 at 
     the second succeeding (1993) Annual Meeting of the 
     Shareholders and Class 3 shall expire at the third succeeding 
     (1994) Annual Meeting of the Shareholders.  At each Annual 
     Meeting after such initial Classification, Directors to 
     replace those whose terms expire at such Annual Meeting shall 
     be elected to hold office until the third succeeding Annual 
     Meeting of the Shareholders.  A Director shall hold office 
     until the Annual Meeting of the year in which his term expires       
     and until his successor shall be elected and qualified, 
     subject to prior death, resignation, retirement, or removal 
     from office.

          If the number of Directors is changed pursuant to the 
     By-Laws of the Corporation after the effective date of this 
     ARTICLE SEVENTH, any newly created Directorships or any 
     decrease in Directorships shall be apportioned among the 
     classes so as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as       
     possible.  Newly created Directorships resulting from an 
     increase in the number of Directors and vacancies caused by 
     death, resignation, retirement, or removal from office, may be       
     filled by the majority of the Directors present at the 
     meeting, if a quorum is present.  If the number of Directors 
     then in office is less than a quorum, such newly created 
     Directorships and vacancies may be filled by the affirmative 
     vote of a majority of the Directors in office.  When the 
     number of Directors is increased by the Board, and the newly 
     created Directorships are filled by the Board, there shall be 
     no classification of the additional Directors until the next 
     Annual Meeting of the Shareholders.  Any Director elected by 
     the Board to fill a vacancy shall serve until the next meeting       
     of the Shareholders, at which the election of the Directors is       
     in the regular order of business, and until his successor is 
     elected and qualified.  In no case will a decrease in the 
     number of Directors shorten the term of an incumbent Director.

          EIGHTH:  A Director of the Corporation shall not be 
     liable to the Corporation or its Shareholders for monetary 
     damages for breach of duty as a Director, except to the extent       
     such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not 
     permitted under the New York Business Corporation Law as the 
     same exists or may hereafter be amended.

          Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by 
     the Shareholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect       
     any right or protection of a Director of the Corporation 
     existing at the time of such repeal or modification."
     (4)  The restatement of the Certificate of Incorporation was authorized
by resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation at
its Regular Meeting on July 21, l994.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate has been subscribed this the 7th

                                      OF
                                  UNIFI, INC.
                                   ARTICLE I
                                  SHAREHOLDERS
     SECTION 1.01.  ANNUAL MEETING.  The Annual Meeting of
Shareholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of
such other business as may come before it shall be held on such
date in each calendar year, not later than the one hundred fiftieth
(150) day after the close of the Corporation's preceding fiscal
year, and at such place as shall be fixed by the President and
stated in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting.
     SECTION 1.02.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the
shareholders, for any purpose of purposes, may be called at any
time by any Director, the President, any Vice President, the
Treasurer or the Secretary or by resolution of the Board of
Directors.  Special meetings of the shareholders shall be held at
such place as shall be fixed by the person or persons calling the
meeting and stated in the notice or waiver of notice of the
meeting.
     SECTION 1.03.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS.  Whenever
shareholders are required or permitted to take any action at a
meeting, written notice shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting and, unless it is the Annual Meeting, indicate that it is
being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons
calling the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting shall also state 
                                  1
the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  If, at
any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if taken,
entitle shareholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 623 of
the Business Corporation Law to receive payment for their shares,
the notice of such meeting shall include a statement of that
purpose to that effect.  A copy of the notice of any meeting shall
be given, personally or by mail, not less than ten nor more than
fifty days before the date of the meeting, to each shareholder
entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice is given
when deposited in the United States mail, with postage thereon
prepaid, directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears
on the record of shareholders, or, if he shall have filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him
be mailed to some other address, then directed to him at such other
address.
     When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, it shall
not be necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the
time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at
the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned
meeting any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted on the original date of the meeting.  However, if after
the adjournment, the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for
the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each shareholder of record on the new record date entitled
to notice under the next preceding paragraph.
                                   2

     SECTION 1.04.  WAIVERS OF NOTICE.  Notice of meeting need not
be given to any shareholder who submits a signed Waiver of Notice,
in person or by proxy, whether before or after the meeting.  The
attendance of any shareholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy,
without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack
of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a Waiver of Notice by
him.
     SECTION 1.05.  QUORUM.  The holders of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of shareholders for the transaction of any business,
provided that when a specified item of business is required to be
voted on by a class or series, voting as a class, the holders of a
majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of such specified item of business.
     When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not
broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any shareholders.
     The shareholders present may adjourn the meeting despite the
absence of a quorum and at andy such adjourned meeting at which the
requisite amount of voting stock shall be represented, any business
may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting
as originally noticed.
     SECTION 1.06.  FIXING RECORD DATE.  For the purpose of
determining the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to
express consent to or dissent from any proposal without a meeting,
or for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive 
                                3
payment of any dividend or the allotment of any rights, or for the
purpose of any other action, the Board of Directors may fix, in
advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of
shareholders.  Such date shall not be more than fifty nor less than
ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than fifty days
prior to any other action.
     When a determination of shareholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting or shareholders has been made
as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any
adjournment thereof, unless the Board of Directors fixes a new
record date under this Section for the adjourned meeting.
     SECTION 1.07.  LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS AT MEETING.  A list of
shareholders as of the record date, certified by the corporate
officer responsible for its preparation or by a transfer agent,
shall be produced at any meeting of shareholders upon the request
thereat or prior thereto of any shareholder.  If the right to vote
at any meeting is challenged, the inspectors of election, or person
presiding thereat, shall require such list of shareholders to be
produced as evidence of the right of the persons challenged to vote
at such meeting, and all persons who appear from such list to be
shareholders entitled to vote thereat may vote at such meeting.
     SECTION 1.08.  PROXIES.  Every shareholder entitled to vote at
a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent without
a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by
proxy.
                                  4

     Every proxy must be signed by the shareholder or his attorney-
in-fact.  No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven
months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the
proxy.  Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the
shareholder executing it, except as otherwise provided in this
Section.
     The authority of the holder of a proxy to act shall not be
revoked by the incompetence or death of the shareholder who
executed the proxy unless, before the authority is exercised,
written notice of an adjudication of such incompetence or of such
death is received by the Corporate Officer responsible for
maintaining the list of shareholders.
     Except when other provision shall have been made by written
agreement between the parties, the record holder of shares which
are held by a pledgee as security or which belong to another, upon
demand therefor and payment of necessary expenses thereof, shall
issue to the pledgor or to such owner of such shares a proxy to
vote or take other action thereon.
     A shareholder shall not sell his vote or issue a proxy to vote
to any person for any sum of money or anything of value, except as
authorized in this Section and Section 620 of the Business
Corporation Law.
     A proxy which is entitled "irrevocable proxy" and which states
that it is irrevocable, is irrevocable when it is held by any of
the following or a nominee of any of the following:
                                   5

     (1)  A Pledgee;

     (2)  A person who has purchased or agreed to purchase the   
          shares;

     (3)  A creditor or creditors of the Corporation who extend or 
          continue credit to the Corporation in consideration of 
          the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in 
          consideration of such extension or continuation of 
          credit, the amount thereof, and the name of the person 
          extending or continuing credit;

     (4)  A person who has contracted to perform services as an 
          Officer of the Corporation, if a proxy is required by the 
          contract of employment, if the proxy states that it was 
          given in consideration of such contract of employment, 
          the name of the employee and the period of employment 
          contracted for;

     (5)  A person designated by or under an agreement under 
          paragraph (a) of said Section 620.

     Notwithstanding a provision in a proxy, stating that it is
irrevocable, the proxy becomes revocable after the pledge is
redeemed, or the debt of the Corporation is paid, or the period of
employment provided for in the contract of employment has
terminated, or the agreement under paragraph (a) of said Section
620 has terminated, and becomes revocable, in a case provided for
in subparagraph (3) or (4) above, at the end of the period, if any,
specified therein as the period during which it is irrevocable, or
three years after the date of the proxy, whichever period is less,
unless the period of irrevocability is renewed from time to time by
the execution of a new irrevocable proxy as provided in this
Section.  This paragraph does not affect the duration of a proxy
under the second paragraph of this Section.
                                     6


     A proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it
irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of the
existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and
its irrevocability is noted conspicuously on the face or back of
the certificate representing such shares.
     SECTION 1.09.  SELECTION AND DUTIES OF INSPECTORS.  The Board
of Directors, in advance of any shareholders' meeting, may appoint
one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.  If inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding
at a shareholders' meeting may, and on the request of any
shareholder entitled to vote thereat shall, appoint one or more
inspectors.  In case any person appointed failed to appear or act,
the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board in
advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding
thereat.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and
according to the best of his ability.
     The inspectors shall determine the number of shares
outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at
the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of
proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and
determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with
the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or
consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to
conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.  On 
                                  7
request of the person presiding at the meeting or any shareholder
entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make a report in
writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by them and
execute a certificate of any fact found by them.  Any report or
certificate made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated and of the vote as certified by them.
     Unless appointed by the Board of Directors or requested by a
shareholder, as above provided in this Section, inspectors shall be
dispensed with at all meetings of shareholders.
     The vote upon any question before any shareholders' meeting
need not be by ballot.
     SECTION 1.10.  QUALIFICATION OF VOTERS.  Every shareholder of
record shall be entitled at every meeting of shareholders to one
vote for every share standing in his name on the record of
shareholders, except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Section and except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.
     Treasury shares and shares held by another domestic or foreign
corporation of any type or kind, if a majority of the shares
entitled to vote in the election of Directors of such other
corporation is held by the Corporation, shall not be shares
entitled to vote or to be counted in determining the total number
of outstanding shares.
     Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian,
conservator, committee, or other fiduciary, except a Trustee, may
be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without transfer of 
                                  8
such shares into his name.  Shares held by a Trustee may be voted
by him, either in person or by proxy, only after the shares have
been transferred into his name as Trustee or into the name of his
nominee.
     Shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted
by him without the transfer thereof into his name if authority so
to do is contained in an order of the court by which such receiver
was appointed.
     A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to
vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the
name of the pledgee, or a nominee of the pledgee.
     Redeemable shares which have been called for redemption shall
not be deemed to be outstanding shares for the purpose of voting or
determining the total number of shares entitled to vote on any
matter on and after the date on which written notice of redemption
has been sent to holders thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem
such shares has been deposited with a bank or trust company with
irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption price
to the holders of the shares upon surrender of certificates
therefor.
     Shares standing in the name of another domestic or foreign
corporation of any type or kind may be voted by such Officer, agent
or proxy as the By-Laws of such corporation may provide, or, in the
absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such
corporation may determine.
                                  9

     When shares are registered on the record of shareholders of
the Corporation in the name of, or have passed by operation of law
or by virtue of any deed of trust or other instrument to two or
more fiduciaries, and if the fiduciaries shall be equally divided
as to voting such shares, any court having jurisdiction of their
accounts, upon petition by any of such fiduciaries or by any party
in interest, may direct the voting of such shares for the best
interest of the beneficiaries.  This paragraph shall not apply in
any case where the instrument or order of the court appointing such
fiduciaries shall otherwise direct how such shares shall be voted.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs of this Section, the
Corporation shall be protected in treating the persons whose names
shares stand on the record of shareholders as the owners thereof
for all purposes.
     SECTION 1.11.  VOTE OF SHAREHOLDERS.  Directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of
shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the
election. Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of
Directors, is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall,
except as otherwise required by the Business Corporation Law or by
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, be authorized
by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders by the
holders of shares entitled to vote thereon.
     SECTION 1.12.  WRITTEN CONSENT OF SHAREHOLDERS.  Whenever
under the Business Corporation Law shareholders are required or
permitted to take any action by vote, such action may be taken 
                                  10
without a meeting on written consent, setting forth the action so
taken, signed by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to
vote thereon.  This paragraph shall not be construed to alter or
modify the provisions of any section of the Business Corporation
Law or any provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation not inconsistent with the Business Corporation Law
under which the written consent of the holders of less than all
outstanding shares is sufficient for corporate action.
     Written consent thus given by the holders of all outstanding
shares entitled to vote shall have the same effect as a unanimous
vote of shareholders.
                             ARTICLE II
                             DIRECTORS
     SECTION 2.01.  MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS; QUALIFICATIONS OF
DIRECTORS.  The business of the Corporation shall be managed by its
Board of Directors, each of whom shall be at least twenty-one years
of age.
     Directors need not be Stockholders.
     The Board of Directors, in addition to the powers and
authority expressly conferred upon it herein, by statute, by the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation and otherwise, is
hereby empowered to exercise all such powers as may be exercised by
the Corporation, except as expressly provided otherwise by the
statutes of the State of New York, by the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation and these By-Laws.
                                   11

     SECTION 2.02.  NUMBER OF DIRECTORS.  The number of Directors
which shall constitute the entire Board shall be eleven (11), but
this number may be increased and subsequently again increased or
decreased from time to time by the affirmative vote of the majority
of Directors, except that the number of Directors shall not be less
than nine (9).
     SECTION 2.03.  CLASSIFICATION AND ELECTION.  (a)  The
Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class
1, Class 2 and Class 3.  All classes shall be as nearly equal in
number as possible and no class shall include less than three (3)
Directors.  The term of office of the Directors initially
classified shall be as follows:  Class 1 shall expire at the next
(1992) Annual Meeting of the Shareholders, Class 2 shall expire at
the second succeeding (1993) Annual Meeting of the Shareholders,
and Class 3 shall expire at the third succeeding (1994) Annual
Meeting of the Shareholders.  (b)  At each Annual Meeting after
such initial classification, Directors to replace those whose terms
expired at such Annual Meeting shall be elected to hold office
until the third succeeding Annual Meeting of the Shareholders.  A
Director shall hold office until the Annual Meeting for the year in
which his term expires and subject to prior death, resignation,
retirement, or removal from office, until his successor shall be
elected and qualified.
     SECTION 2.04.  NEWLY CREATED DIRECTORSHIP AND VACANCIES. 
Newly created Directorships or any decrease in Directorship shall
be apportioned among the classes as to make all classes as nearly 
                                  12
equal in number as possible.  Newly created Directorships resulting
from an increase in the number of Directors and vacancies caused by
death, resignation, retirement, or removal from office, subject to
Section 2.05(b), may be filled by the majority of the Directors
voting on the particular matter, if a quorum is present.  If the
number of Directors then in office is less than a quorum, such
newly created Directorships and vacancies may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors in office.  When
the number of Directors is increased by the Board, and the newly
created Directorships are filled by the Board, there shall be no
classification of the additional Directors until the next Annual
Meeting of the shareholders.  Any Director elected by the Board to
fill a vacancy shall serve until the next meeting of the
shareholders, at which the election of the Directors is in the
regular order of business, and until his successor is elected and
qualified.
     In no case will a decrease in the number of Directors shorten
the term of an incumbent Director.
     SECTION 2.05(A).  RESIGNATIONS.  Any Director of the
Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary of the
Corporation.  Such resignation shall take effect at the time
specified therein, if any, or if no time is specified therein, then
upon receipt of such notice by the addressee; and, unless otherwise
provided therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be
necessary to make it effective.
                                  13
     SECTION 2.05(B).  REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS.  Any or all of the
Directors may be removed at any time (i) for cause by vote of the
shareholders or by action on the Board of Directors or (ii) without
cause by vote of the shareholders, except as expressly provided
otherwise by Section 706 of the Business Corporation Law.  The
Board of Directors shall fill vacancies occurring in the Board by
reason of removal of Directors for cause.  Vacancies occurring by
reason of removal without cause shall be filled by the
Shareholders.
     SECTION 2.06.  QUORUM OF DIRECTORS.  At all meetings of the
Board of Directors, a majority of the number of Directors then
office shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the
Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall
be the act of the Board of Directors, except as expressly provided
otherwise by the statutes of the State of New York and except as
provided in the third sentence of Section 2.04, in Section 2.11 and
Section 7.09 hereof.
     A majority of the Directors present, whether or not a quorum
is present, may adjourn any meeting of the Directors to another
time and place.  Notice of any adjournment need not be given if
such time and place are announced at the meeting.
     SECTION 2.07.  ANNUAL MEETING.  The Board of Directors shall
meet immediately following the adjournment of the Annual Meeting of
shareholders in each year at the same place and no notice of such
meeting shall be necessary.
                                   14
     SECTION 2.08.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  Regular meetings of the
Board of Directors may be held at such time and place as shall from
time to time be fixed by the Board and no notice thereof shall be
necessary.
     SECTION 2.09.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings may be
called at any time by any Director, the President, any Vice
President, the Treasurer, or the Secretary or by resolution of the
Board of Directors.  Special meetings shall be held at such place

     SECTION 2.10.  COMPENSATION.  Directors shall receive such
fixed sums and expenses of attendance for attendance at each
meeting of the Board or of any committee and/or such salary as may
be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors; provided

Director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor.
     SECTION 2.11.  COMMITTEES.  The Board of Directors, by
resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, may designate
from among its members an Executive Committee and other committees,

the Board of Directors, except that no such committee shall have
authority as to the following matters:

             needs shareholder's authorization under the Business 
             Corporation Law.
                                     15

members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member or
members at any meeting of such committee.  Each such committee
shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.
     Regular meetings of any such committee shall be held at such
time and place as shall from time to time be fixed by such
committee and no notice thereof shall be necessary.  Special
meetings may be called at any time by any Officer of the
Corporation or any member of such committee.  Notice of each
special meeting of each such committee shall be given (or waived)
in the same manner as notice of a special meeting of the Board of
Directors.  A majority of the members of any such committee shall

transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its
Directors, or between the Corporation and any other corporation,
firm, association or other entity in which one or more of the
Corporation's Directors are Directors or Officers, or are 
                                 16
financially interested, shall be either void or voidable for this
reason alone or by reason alone that such Director or Directors are
present at the meeting of the Board of Directors, or of a committee
thereof, which approves such contract or transaction, or that his
or their votes are counted for such purpose:
     (1)     If the fact of such common Directorship, Officership 
             or financial interest is disclosed or known to the 
             Board or committee, and the Board or committee 
             approves such contract or transaction by a vote 
             sufficient for such purpose without counting the vote 
             or votes of such interested Director or Directors;

     (2)     If such common Directorship, Officership or financial 
             interest is disclosed or known to the shareholders 
             entitled to vote thereon, and such contract or 
             transaction is approved by vote of the shareholders; 
             or

     (3)     If the contract or transaction is fair and reasonable 
             as to the Corporation at the time it is approved by 
             the Board, a committee of the shareholders.

     Common or interested Directors may be counted in determining
the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a
committee which approves such contract or transaction.
     SECTION 2.13.  LOANS TO DIRECTORS.  A loan shall not be made
by the Corporation to any Director unless it is authorized by vote
of the shareholders.  For this purpose, the shares of the Director
who would be the borrower shall not be shares entitled to vote.  A
loan made in violation of this Section shall be a violation of the
duty to the Corporation of the Directors approving it, but the
obligation of the borrower with respect to the loan shall not be
affected thereby.
     SECTION 2.14.  CONSENT TO ACTION.  Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors or any committee 
                                 17
thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board

action so taken, to the adoption of a resolution authorizing the
action.  The resolution and the written consent thereto shall be
filed with the Minutes of the proceeding of the Board or the
committee.

the Board of Directors may be removed by the Board with or without

Corporation in which the Corporation may own securities and at any
such meeting shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and
powers incident to the ownership of such securities and which, as

from time to time confer like powers upon any other person or
persons.

a registrar other than the Corporation itself or its employee.  In
case any Officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such Officer

notice thereof, except as expressly provided otherwise by the
Statutes of the State of New York.
     SECTION 4.04.  NEW CERTIFICATES.  The Corporation may issue a

judgment of the Directors) to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss or
theft of any such certificate or the issuance of such new

     SECTION 6.01.  RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION.  The Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who was or is
a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including
appeals, by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director,
Officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer or employee of
any Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a Director, Officer or employee or in any
other capacity while serving as a Director, Officer or employee, to
the fullest extent authorized by the New York Business Corporation
Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all 
                                  25
expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person
in connection therewith; provided, however, that except as provided
in Section 6.02 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify
any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.
     The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall
be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if
required by law at the time of such payment, the payment of such
expenses incurred by a Director or Officer in his capacity as a
Director or Officer (and not in any other capacity in which service
was or is rendered by such person while a Director or Officer,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan)
in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such Director or Officer, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such Director
or Officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or
otherwise.
                                   26

     "Employee" as used herein, includes both an active employee in

has been a party to a written agreement under which he might be, or
might have been, obligated to render services to the Corporation.
     SECTION 6.02.  RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT.  If a claim
under Section 6.01 is not paid in full by the Corporation within
sixty (60) days or, in cases of advances of expenses, twenty (20)
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation,
the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce
claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been
tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct which make it permissible under the New York
Business Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the
claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defence shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to
the commencement of such action that indemnification of the
claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the New York Business
Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its 
                                 27
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders)
that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
claimant had not met the applicable standard of conduct.  The
Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding commenced pursuant to this Article that the procedures
and presumptions of this Article are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in any such proceeding that the
Corporation is bound by all provisions of this Article.
     SECTION 6.03.  NONEXCLUSIVENESS.  The indemnification and
advances of expenses granted pursuant to, or provided by, this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
a Director or Officer seeking indemnification or advancement or
expenses may be entitled, whether contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, and the Board of Directors is
authorized, from time to time in its discretion, to enter into
agreements with one or more Directors, Officers and other persons
providing for the maximum indemnification allowed by applicable
law.
     The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses
incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Article (a) shall apply to acts or
omissions antedating the adoption of this By-Law, (b) shall be
severable, (c) shall not be exclusive of other rights to which any
Director, Officer or employee may now or hereafter become entitled
apart from this Article, (d) shall continue as to a person who has 
                                  28
ceased to be such Director, Officer or employee and (e) shall inure
to the benefit of the heirs, Executors and Administrators of such
a person.
     SECTION 6.04.  INSURANCE FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS.  The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance (a) to indemnify the Corporation for any
obligations which it incurs as the result of the indemnification of
Directors and Officers under the provisions of this Article; (b) to
indemnify Directors and Officers in instances which they may be
indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this
Article; and (c) to indemnify Directors and Officers in instances
in which they may not otherwise be indemnified by the Corporation
under the provisions of this Article, provided the contract of
insurance covering such Directors and Officers provides, in a
manner acceptable to the Superintendent of Insurance of the State
of New York, for a retention amount and for co-insurance.
     No insurance under the preceding paragraph of this Section may
provide for any payment, other than the cost of defense, to or on
behalf of any Director of Officer:  (i) if a judgment or other
final adjudication adverse to the insured Director or Officer
establishes that his acts of active and deliberate dishonesty were
material to the cause of action so adjudicated or that he
personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to
which he was not legally entitled, or (ii) in relation to any risk
the insurance of which is prohibited under the insurance laws of
the State of New York.
                                29

THE CIT GROUP/BCC, INC.
P. O. Box 31307

Gentlemen:

     We are pleased to propose the terms upon which you are to act
as our factor, effective as of May 25, 1994.

     1.  We hereby sell and assign to you as absolute owners and
you hereby purchase from us without recourse to us except as
hereinafter set forth, Receivables now or hereafter owned by us
which are acceptable to you.  The term "Receivables" means and
includes accounts, contract rights, documents, instruments and
other evidence of customer indebtedness, whether secured or
unsecured, all proceeds thereof and all of our rights to any
merchandise, delivered or undelivered, which is represented
thereby, including all of our rights of stoppage in transit,
replevin and reclamation as an unpaid vendor or lienor; limited,
however, to those Receivables which we assign to you. On all
Receivables approved by you, you assume the risk of loss resulting
solely from customers' failure to pay at maturity because of
financial inability ("Credit Risk"), but you shall not be
responsible where nonpayment is due to any other cause. 
Receivables not approved by you, as provided below in whole or in
part, are assigned to you with full recourse to the undersigned to
the extent and in the respects not so approved.

     2.  The amount and terms of each proposed sale or service to
our customers shall be submitted to you for your written approval
(which shall include facsimile) which approval may be withdrawn at
any time before actual shipment or performance is completed. We
warrant as to each such Receivable that: it is a bona fide existing
obligation created by the absolute sale and delivery of merchandise
or the rendition of services to customers in the ordinary course of
business; we have good title thereto and good right to sell and
assign same to you; all documents delivered to you in connection
therewith are genuine; it will at all times be enforceable against
all parties thereto without defense, offset or counterclaim, real
or claimed; it is and will at all times be free and clear of liens
and encumbrances, except in your favor; it will be paid according
to its terms and it does not represent a sale to any entity which
is our parent, subsidiary or affiliate.

     3.  You shall purchase and acquire a security interest in our
Receivables in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, in
payment, shall credit the gross amount of all assigned Receivables
to a Reserve Account which you shall establish on your books in our
name.  You shall also establish a Cash Account on your books in our
name and, at the time you credit the gross amount of assigned
receivables to our Reserve Account, you shall charge the Cash
Account with appropriate factoring charges and on the average
maturity date of each assignment (calculated on the maturity date
of each invoice in the assignment plus five business days for
collection) you will transfer the net amount of the assignment
(invoices less credits and discounts made available to or extended
to our customers, whether taken or not) from the Reserve Account to
the Cash Account.  The Cash Account shall be charged with interest
and any other amounts chargeable to us hereunder. You shall furnish
us with advices of all entries to our Reserve and Cash Accounts. 
As you credit our Reserve Account with the gross amount of
Receivables assigned to you, you will debit the same amount to an
Accounts Receivable Account which you shall establish on your books
in our name and which you shall credit with all credit memoranda
and allowances to our customers and with all payments received from
our customers.  A discount, factored credit or allowance after
issuance or granting may be claimed solely by the customer, and
after your purchase of Receivables we will not issue or grant any
discounts, credits or allowances to the customer without your prior
written consent.

     You may, at your option, maintain such reserve as you deem
necessary from time to time as security for payment and performance
of our Obligations, as defined in Paragraph "6".

     4.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, you shall
remit to us (and at any time in your sole discretion, you may
remit) any moneys standing to our credit in our Cash Account on
your books in excess of the reserve provided for herein.  You may
charge to our Cash Account interest on any debit balance in our
Cash Account.  Such interest shall be charged as of the last day of
each month, at the "Chemical Rate". ("Chemical Rate" is defined as
the per annum rate of interest publicly announced by Chemical Bank
in New York, New York, from time to time as its prime rate.  The
Chemical Rate is not intended to be the lowest rate charged by
Chemical Bank to its borrowers.) All such interest shall be
computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a
year consisting of 360 days. Any adjustment in your interest rate,
whether downward or upward, will become effective on the first day
of the month next following the month in which the Chemical rate of
interest is reduced or increased. You shall also be entitled to
charge interest at the cost of funds rate (as defined below) on
Receivables with respect to which an alleged claim, defense or
offset is asserted or for which you have not assumed the Credit
Risk from the maturity date of the Receivable invoice until such
Receivable has been cleared from the Accounts Receivable Account. 
If you hold a collected credit balance, you shall credit our Cash
Account as of the last day of the month, interest on such credit
balance at 2.75% below the Chemical Rate of interest as defined
above.  Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month or as
soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, you shall send us a
statement of our account.  Each such statement will be fully
binding upon us and shall constitute an account stated unless we
give you written notice of exceptions within thirty (30) days from
its date of mailing.  We agree to pay to you on demand any debit
balance in our account.  Your factoring charge referred to above
shall be as follows:  .35% of the net amount of all Receivables. 
We together with our subsidiary company, Unifi Spun Yarns, Inc.,
which has entered into a separate factoring agreement with you of
even date hereof ("Unifi Spun Agreement") jointly and severally
agree to factor a minimum annual volume of $100,000,000.00 during
each Contract Year this Agreement and the Unifi Spun Agreement is
in effect.  ("Contract Year" shall mean the twelve month period
beginning on the effective date of this agreement and each
succeeding twelve month period beginning on the anniversary date of
this agreement.) Please reference Letter Amendment of even date
hereof.

     5.  We agree to notify you promptly of all customer disputes,
claims and returns, to indemnify and protect you against liability,
loss or expense caused by or arising out of such disputes, claims
or returns, and, subject to your prior approval in each instance,
to issue credit memoranda immediately (with duplicates to you) upon
the acceptance of returns or granting of allowances.  Without your
prior written consent, we will not change the amount or terms of
any Receivable, whether or not approved, or grant any other
indulgence with respect thereto.  You may at any time charge to our
Cash Account, after 60 days notice, the amount of any customer
deduction and as of the due date of the invoice, the amount of (a)
each Receivable with respect to which any customer dispute is
asserted or which is not paid in full at its due date for any
reason other than financial ability to pay and (b) each Receivable
upon which you have not assumed the Credit Risk.  Such charge shall
not constitute a reassignment to us of the Receivable involved and
title remains in you until you are fully reimbursed.  Until
reassigned to us you shall remain the absolute owner of each
Receivable assigned to you and of any rejected, returned or
recovered merchandise in connection therewith, with the right to
take possession thereof at any time, and until such possession is
taken, such merchandise shall be set aside, marked in your name and
held for your account as owned.  At your option, we agree to resell
such merchandise for your account at prices you deem advisable with
the proceeds made payable to you in all events and any
deficiencies, costs and expenses thereof payable by us.

     6.  With regard to those Receivables which we assign to you
hereunder, we hereby grant you a security interest in our now
existing and future accounts (whether or not specifically scheduled
in accordance with Paragraph "7"), instruments, documents, contract
rights, chattel paper, general intangibles, unpaid seller's rights,
returned and repossessed goods, reserves and credit balances
hereunder, and in all guaranties and collateral therefor, and all
proceeds of all the foregoing.  We will not grant a security
interest in Inventory to anyone else without giving you prior
written notice.

     7.  We shall, from time to time, provide you with a schedule
of Receivables purchased by you, together with copies of customers'
invoices, conclusive evidence of shipment, and such other
documentation and proof of delivery as you shall at any time
require and documents, instruments and other evidences of customer
indebtedness, duly endorsed in blank by us.  All invoices to
customers shall state plainly on their face that the accounts
receivable represented by such invoices have been assigned and are
payable only to you.  We are to prepare and mail all customers'
invoices, but you may do so at your option.  All Receivables shall
be subject to the assignment prescribed herein, whether or not we
execute any specific instrument of assignment or schedule.  You are
authorized to regard our printed name or rubber stamp signature on
assignment schedules or invoices as the equivalent of a manual
signature by one of our authorized officers or agents.  If any
remittances are made directly to us by our customers, we shall act
as trustee of an express trust for your benefit, hold the same as
your property and immediately deliver to you the identical checks,
moneys or other forms of remittance received, and you shall have
the right to endorse our name on any and all checks and other forms
of remittances received where such endorsement is required to
effect collection. We shall not sell or assign, negotiate, pledge
or grant any security interest in any Receivables to anyone other
than you without prior written notification to you. All sales of
Receivables to you by us shall be deemed to include all of our
right, title and interest to all of our books, records and files
and all other data and documents relating to each Receivables. If
any tax by any governmental authority is imposed on any transaction
between us, or in respect to sales or the merchandise affected by
such sales, which you are required to withhold or pay, we agree to
indemnify and hold you harmless in respect to such taxes, and we
will repay you the amount of any such taxes, which shall be charged
to our Cash Account.

     8.  The initial term of this agreement shall be two years from
the effective date of this agreement.  Thereafter, this agreement
may be terminated by us upon written notice to you prior to the
anniversary date of this agreement, and at any time upon 30 days
written notice by you to us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should
we become insolvent, be unable to meet our debts as they mature,
commit an act of bankruptcy, stop doing business, call a meeting of
our creditors, breach any warranty, promise or covenant in this
Agreement, fail to pay any Obligation when due, or have commenced
by or against us any bankruptcy, insolvency arrangement,
reorganization, receivership or similar proceeding, you shall have
the right to terminate this agreement at any time without notice.
Notwithstanding any termination, all the terms, conditions,
security interests and provisions hereof shall continue to be fully
operative during the time ("Termination Period") until all
transactions entered into, rights created or obligations incurred
hereunder prior to the termination and all of our Obligations have
been fully disposed of, concluded, paid, satisfied any/or
liquidated. If the debit balance of our Accounts Receivable Account
exceeds the credit balance of our Reserve Account, the difference
will appear on your monthly statement to us as a debit balance of
funds advanced and vice versa.  You shall be entitled to charge our
Reserve Account for funds advanced hereunder, as of the last day of
each month, interest on the debit balance of average daily funds
advanced for the month at the "Chemical Rate". ("Chemical Rate" is
defined as the per annum rate of interest publicly announced by
Chemical Bank in New York, New York, from time as its prime rate. 
The Chemical Rate is not intended to be the lowest rate of interest
charged by Chemical Bank to its borrowers.)  All such interest
shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the
basis of a year consisting of 360 days.  Any adjustment in your
interest rate, whether downward or upward, will become effective on
the first day of the month next following the month in which the
Chemical Rate of interest is reduced or increased.  Upon
termination of this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph
shall supersede any provisions of the Agreement which are or become
inconsistent herewith.  Please reference Letter Amendment dated of
even date hereof.

     9.  This Agreement and all transactions hereunder shall be
governed as to validity, enforcement, interpretation, construction
and in all other respects by the laws of the State of North
Carolina and shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their
heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.  The
agreement shall become effective only from the date of your written
acceptance.

     10. No delay or failure on your part in the exercise of any
right, privilege or option hereunder shall operate as a waiver of
any thereof, and no waiver whatever shall be valid unless in
writing signed by you and then only to the extent therein set
forth.  This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally, is
our entire contract and is for the benefit of and binding upon us
and our respective successors and assigns, heirs, executors and
administrators.  All notices are given when mailed registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested.

     11. Each of us expressly submits and consents to the
jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of North Carolina and
United States District Court for the Western District of North
Carolina with respect to any controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any supplement hereto or to any transactions
in connection herewith and hereby waive personal service of the
summons, complaint or other process or papers to be issued therein
and hereby agree that service of such summons, complaint, process
or papers may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to
the other party at the address appearing herein; failure on the
part of either party to appear or answer within thirty (30) days
after the mailing of such summons, complaint, process or papers
shall constitute a default entitling the other party to enter a
judgment or order as demanded or prayed for therein.  Insofar as
permitted by law, WE EACH HEREBY WAIVER ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

     12. We hereby constitute and appoint you or such person as you
may name, including substitutions, as our attorney-in-fact to
exercise, and at your cost and expense, to execute all necessary
documents in our name and do all other things necessary to carry
out this Agreement.  We hereby ratify and approve all acts of the
attorney and agree that neither you nor the attorney will be liable
for any acts of commission or omission nor for any error of
judgement or mistake of fact or law, provided you have acted as in
a manner consistent with reasonable prudent business standards.
This power being coupled with an interest is irrevocable so long as
any Receivable assigned and sold you remains unpaid or we are
indebted to you in any manner.

                                  Very truly yours,

Gentlemen:

This letter amendment shall serve to modify the terms and
conditions of the separate Factoring Agreements between you and us
dated of even date hereof.  Notwithstanding the minimum Annual
Volume guaranteed amount as set forth in paragraph 4 of both of the
Factoring Agreements, the minimum Annual Volume guaranteed amount
will be increased based on the customer credit line provided
jointly and severally to Unifi, Inc. and Unifi Spun Yarns, Inc. by
you for Texfi Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Texfi"), and will
be as set forth in the chart below.

Also, in the event that the credit line to Texfi is increased or
reduced by CIT, Unifi, Inc. or Unifi Spun Yarns, Inc., the minimum
Annual Volume guaranteed amount, which is the joint and several
obligation of Unifi, Inc. and Unifi Spun Yarns, Inc. will be as set
forth below.

                              Minimum Annual Volume
        Texfi Line  Rate        Guaranteed Amount         Term
        ----------  ----      ---------------------      -------
Less 
Than   $3,000,000    .35%        $100,000,000           1 Year
       $3,000,000    .35%        $190,000,000           2 Years
       $4,000,000    .35%        $220,000,000           2 Years
       $5,000,000    .35%        $250,000,000           2 Years

Any excess volume factored over the minimum Annual Volume
guaranteed amount during the first Contract Year shall be applied
to the second Contract Year's minimum Annual Volume guaranteed
amount. (Contract Year is defined in the Factoring Agreements.) Any
shortfall in the first Contract Year may be made up during the
second Contract Year. At the end of the two-year period, any
shortfall in the minimum Annual Volume guaranteed amount will be
paid to you based on the .35% rate.

Furthermore, we agree that the minimum Annual Volume guaranteed
amount will also be increased on a pro rata basis at credit lines
offered to Texfi between amounts stated above.

Finally, notwithstanding the termination language as stated in
paragraph 8 of the Factoring Agreements, the Factoring Agreements
may be terminated after the first Contract Year if the Texfi credit
provided jointly and severally to us by you is less than
$3,000,000, by giving you written notice prior to the anniversary
date.

The remaining terms and conditions of the Factoring Agreements
shall remain in full force and effect unless specifically amended
herein.

                                Very truly yours,

                               FIRST FACTORS CORPORATION



     THIS AMENDMENT, entered into this 5th day of January, 1994, by and
between UNIFI, INC. (the "Client") and FIRST FACTORS CORPORATION, (the
"Factor");

     WHEREAS, the Client and the Factor wish to amend the Factoring Contract
and Security Agreement of May 2, 1988 to provide for the addition of the
following:

     8.    INTEREST.  Client shall pay interest upon the daily debit balance
in the Client Maturity Account at the close of business each day at a rate
equal to two percent (2%) per annum over the Prime Rate.  "Prime Rate" is
defined as the interest rate announced from time to time by First Union
National Bank as its prime interest rate.  Interest will be calculated on a
daily basis (computed on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of
three hundred sixty (360) days) and shall be charged to the Client Maturity
Account as of the last day of each month.  If the daily balance in the Client
Maturity Account reflects a credit balance, Factor shall credit the Client
Maturity Account, as of the last day of the month, with interest on such
daily credit balance at a rate equal to one percent (1%) below the Prime
Rate.  The Prime Rate in effect on the date of this agreement and on the last
day of each calendar month hereafter shall be the applicable Prime Rate in
determining the rate of interest payable hereunder for the following month
and shall be effective as of the first day of such following month.

     NOW, THEREFORE, said Factoring Contract is hereby amended. Except as
specifically amended herein, all of the terms and provisions of the Factoring
Contract and Security Agreement referred to above shall remain in full force
and effect.

This 5th day of January, 1994.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. The accounts of all foreign
subsidiaries have been included on the basis of fiscal periods ended three
months or less prior to the dates of the consolidated balance sheets. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

FISCAL YEAR: The Company's fiscal year is the fifty-two or fifty-three weeks
ending the last Sunday in June. All three fiscal years presented were
comprised of fifty-two weeks. 

RECLASSIFICATION: The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain
prior year information to conform with the current presentation format.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: Substantially all revenue from sales is recognized at
the time shipments are made.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
are translated at year-end rates of exchange and revenues and expenses are
translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains and losses
resulting from translation are accumulated in a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the
subsidiary's functional currency) are included in net income.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents are defined as short-term
investments having an original maturity of three months or less.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: Short-term investments are compromised primarily of
high quality, highly liquid marketable securities with original maturities
greater than three months. The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" as of the end of its current fiscal year and the adoption
had no significant impact on the financial statements. Short-term investments
at June 26, 1994 are classified as available-for-sale securities and are
carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Short-term
investments at June 27, 1993 are carried at the lower of cost or market, with
market value exceeding cost by approximately $.6 million. 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: Certain customer accounts receivable are factored. An
allowance for losses is provided for accounts not factored based on a
periodic review of the accounts. Reserve for such losses was $4.3 million in
1994 and 3.7 million in 1993.

INVENTORIES: The Company utilizes the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for
valuing certain inventories representing 57% of all inventories at June 26,
1994, and the first-in first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
Inventory values computed by the LIFO method are lower than current market
values. Inventories valued at current or replacement cost would have been
approximately $5.6 million and $7.4 million in excess of the LIFO valuation
at June 26, 1994 and June 27, 1993, respectively. Finished goods, work in
process, and raw materials and supplies at June 26, 1994 and June 27, 1993,
amounted to $57.6 million and $50.3 million; $12.9 million and $13.2 million;
and $29.8 million and $41.5 million, respectively.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

INVESTMENT IN NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES: The investments in common
stock of 45% and 32% owned affiliated companies are accounted for by the
equity method and are stated at cost plus the Company's share of
undistributed earnings since acquisition.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is computed for asset groups primarily utilizing the
straight-line method for financial reporting and accelerated methods for tax
reporting.

OTHER ASSETS: Other assets consist primarily of long-term investments in
marketable equity securities, long-term notes receivable, deferred debt
expense and, in the prior year, noncompete covenants and identified
intangibles associated with acquisitions. The long-term investments in
marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair market value of $9.5 million and $8.5 million at June 26,
1994 and June 27, 1993, respectively. The deferred debt expense, intangible
assets and noncompete covenants are being amortized on a straight-line method
over periods of two to fifteen years. Accumulated amortization at June 26,
1994 and June 27, 1993 was $16.0 million and $17.9 million, respectively.

INCOME TAXES: The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated
federal tax return. Income tax expense is computed on the basis of
transactions entering into pretax operating results. Deferred income taxes
have been provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. Income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed
earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed to be
permanently invested.

EARNINGS PER SHARE: Earnings per common and common equivalent share are
computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding plus, to the extent applicable, common stock equivalents.
Average common and common equivalent shares for primary earnings per share
were 71,020,075, 70,861,463 and 70,226,216 for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Reported fully diluted earnings per share amounts are based on
71,026,610, 78,640,459 and 72,578,448 shares for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The effect of the convertible subordinated notes was
antidilutive for the fiscal year ended June 26, 1994.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On August 18, 1993, Pioneer Yarn Mills, Inc. Edenton Cotton Mills, Inc.,
Pioneer Spinning, Inc., Pioneer Cotton Mills, Inc. and certain real estate
(collectively the Pioneer Corporations) were merged into Unifi Spun Yarns,
Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In order to effect the merger,
2,745,284 shares of the Company's common stock were issued for all of the
outstanding shares of the Pioneer Corporations. On April 23, 1993, Vintage
Yarns, Inc. (Vintage) was merged with and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, and 7,891,800 shares of the Company's common stock were issued
in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Vintage. Additionally,
496,832 shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding options on Vintage common stock. On August 8, 1991,
Macfield, Inc. (Macfield) was merged with and into the Company, and
16,263,644 shares of the Company's common stock were issued in exchange for
all of the outstanding common stock of Macfield. All three mergers were
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and accordingly, the accompanying
financial statements for the years ended June 27, 1993 and June 28, 1992 have
been restated to include the accounts and operations of the Pioneer
Corporations, Vintage and Macfield for all periods prior to each of the
representative mergers.

                 Wherever there's fabric, there's fiber . . .

                                      16









































     Prior to the mergers, the Pioneer Corporations used a fiscal year ending
on the last Saturday in September, Vintage used a fiscal year ending
September 30 and Macfield used a fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest
April 30. The 1992 restated financial statements combine the June 28, 1992
financial statements of the Company with the September 26, 1992 financial
statements of the Pioneer Corporations and the September 30, 1992 financial
statements of Vintage and the 1993 restated financial statements combine the
June 27, 1993 financial statements of the Company with the financial
statements of the Pioneer Corporations and Vintage for their respective
twelve month periods ended June 26, 1993 and June 30, 1993, respectively.
Accordingly, to conform the fiscal years of the Pioneer Corporations and
Vintage with the Company's, the results of operations of the Pioneer
Corporations and Vintage for the three months ended September 26, 1992 and
September 30, 1992, respectively, have been included in both fiscal 1993 and
1992. Combined net sales and net income for the three month periods of the
Pioneer Corporations and Vintage were $60.8 million and $9.6 million,
respectively. An adjustment for the net income of the three month period has
been reflected as an adjustment to the June 29, 1992 consolidated retained
earnings and an additional adjustment of $1.9 million has been reflected to
conform the accounting policies of the previously separate companies.
Additionally, to conform the fiscal years of Macfield and the Company, the
net income of Macfield for the two months ended June 30, 1991 of $2.8 million
has been reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings effective July 1,
1991. Separate results of the combining entities for each of the two years in
the period ended June 27, 1993 are as follows (in 000's):

==========================================================================
</TABLE>
For all periods prior to the merger, to the date of the acquisitions, the
Pioneer Corporations and Vintage were taxed as S Corporations and, therefore,
federal and state taxes were assessed to the shareholders. For purposes of
the consolidated financial statements, income taxes have been provided on the
Pioneer Corporations' and Vintage's earnings at the rates which would have
been applicable had such earnings been taxed to it. Distributions to S
Corporation shareholders have been adjusted for the effects of corporate,
federal and state taxes payable on an annualized basis. 

     In connection with the merger with Macfield, approximately $24.8 million
of merger costs and expenses ($18.4 million net of income taxes, or $.26 per
share) were incurred and have been charged to expense in the Company's first
quarter of fiscal 1992.

NON-RECURRING CHARGE

In the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a non-recurring
charge of $13.4 million ($14.1 million after-tax or $.20 per share) related
to the planned sale of the Company's investment in its wholly-owned French
subsidiary, Unifi Texturing, S.A. (UTSA) and the Company's decision to exit
the European nylon market. Of the non-recurring charge, $3.1 million relates
to the loss from the sale of UTSA, 8.8 million relates to the write-off of
goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Company's European nylon
operations and $1.5 million relates to the write-down of nylon production
equipment and inventories. The net sales and net income of UTSA included in
the Company's consolidated results of operations were not significant during
any of the periods presented.

</TABLE>
There are no scheduled maturities of long-term debt in the five years
following June 26, 1994 other than the amounts classified as current above.
     The 6% convertible subordinated notes due March 15, 2002 are convertible
at any time on or before the due date, unless previously redeemed, into
common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $29.67 per share,
subject to adjustment in certain events. The notes are redeemable, in whole
or in part, at the option of the Company on or after March 27, 1995 at
redemption prices beginning at 104% of their principal amount, declining to
par on or after March 15, 2001. The Company had 7.8 million shares reserved
at year end for potential conversion. Interest is payable semi-annually on
March 15 and September 15 of each year.
     The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated using quoted
market price at June 26, 1994 of 99.75% or a total value of $229.4 million.

INCOME TAXES

     Deferred income taxes of $32.4 million and $37.0 million at June 26,
1994 and June 27, 1993, respectively, have been provided as a result of
differences between accounting for financial statement versus tax purposes.
The net deferred tax liability of $32.4 million at June 26, 1994 and $37.0
million at June 27, 1993 consist of deferred tax liabilities resulting
primarily from the temporary differences related to property, plant and
equipment of $52.7 million and $44.8 million, other assets of $.7 million and
$1.9 million and deferred tax assets attributable to merger, valuation, other
assets and reserves of $21.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively. U.S.
deferred income taxes have not been recognized on $35.2 million at June 26,
1994 ($34.0 million at June 27, 1993) of undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, because assets representing those earnings are permanently
invested. The amount of foreign withholding taxes and U.S. taxes that would
be payable upon the repatriation of assets that represent those earnings
would be approximately $13.6 million at June 26, 1994 ($13.1 million at June
27, 1993).

RETIREMENT PLAN

The Company has a qualified profit-sharing plan which provides benefits for
eligible salaried and hourly employees. The annual contribution to the plan,
which is at the discretion of the Board of Directors, amounted to $15.8
million, $13.3 million and $4.8 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
The Company leases its corporate office building from its profit-sharing plan
through an independent trustee.

LEASES, CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

The Company is obligated under operating leases expiring in 1998, consisting
primarily of real estate and equipment. Future obligations for minimum
rentals under the leases during fiscal years after June 26, 1994 are $.6
million in 1995, $.6 million in 1996, $.4 million in 1997, and $.1 million in
1998.
     Rental expense was $3.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.7 million for the
fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     The Company had committed approximately $41.7 million for the purchase
of equipment and facilities at June 26, 1994.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged predominantly in the processing
of yarns by: texturing of synthetic filament polyester and nylon fiber and
spinning of cotton and cotton blend fibers with sales domestically and
internationally, mostly to knitters and weavers for the apparel, industrial,
hosiery, home furnishing, automotive upholstery and other end-use markets.
     The Company had sales to one customer of approximately 12% in 1994 and
12% in 1993 and 11% in 1992.
     The Company's foreign operations are comprised primarily of its
manufacturing facilities in Ireland and France, along with its foreign sales
corporation. The foreign operations had net sales of $178.5 million, $199.3
million and $209.9 million; pretax income, before non-recurring charges, of
$4.4 million, $7.6 million and $12.4 million; and identifiable assets of
$132.0 million, $123.4 million and $159.9 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

                                    19













                   MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW AND ANALYSIS 
                 OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

FISCAL 1994

Net sales decreased 1.5% from 1.406 billion in 1993 to $1.385 billion in
1994. This reduction resulted from an overall decline in sales prices of 6.6%
based on product mix offset by volume gains of 5.5% experienced for the year
in our combined domestic and foreign markets. Domestic growth was achieved
through phased in production from a new texturizing plant in Yadkinville, NC
that commenced operations in 1993 and the completion of other modernization
projects in 1994 and latter stages of the prior fiscal year. Also,
significant volume growth was noted in our spun yarn business for the year
although pressure on pricing and raw material increases adversely impacted
the margins. In the first quarter of 1994, the Company increased its presence
in the cotton and cotton blend spun yarn business through the merger with the
Pioneer Corporations. During 1993, the Company entered this market through
its merger with Vintage Yarns.

     Our European facilities also experienced overall capacity increases.
However, sales prices in local currencies were adversely affected due to weak
economic conditions and overcapacity throughout most of the year. Sales from
foreign operations are denominated in local currencies and are hedged in part
by the purchase of raw materials and services in those same currencies. The
net asset exposure is hedged by borrowings in local currencies which minimize
the risk of currency fluctuations.
     Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased from 81.2% in 1993 to
85.6% in 1994. Impacting cost of sales in the current year was increased
fixed charges, such as depreciation, resulting from added capacity being
absorbed on a lower net sales base. Also, our spun operations experienced
significant raw material price increases during 1994 adversely impacting cost
of sales. On a Company wide basis, however, raw material prices per pound
were lower in the current fiscal year than in the prior year.
     Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased from 2.7% in 1993 to 2.9% in 1994 primarily as a result of
increased fixed charges over a reduced net sales base.
     Interest expenses declined $7.6 million from $25.8 million in 1993 to
$18.2 million in 1994. This decline was attributable to the payoff of long-
term debt acquired through merger activity. The only long-term debt remaining
at June 26, 1994 is the $230 million in convertible subordinated notes issued
in March 1992. Interest income declined $5.2 million from 1993 to 1994 as a
result of decreased short-term investment levels. These investments were used
to payoff acquired debt, modernize capital equipment and for other financing
activities. Other income declined $4.5 million from 1993 to 1994 mainly as a
result of the prior year gains recognized from the sale of investment in
affiliates and short-term investments while no such activity was present in
the current year.
     In connection with the planned sale of the nylon operations in France,
the Company recognized the anticipated loss on the sale of its French
subsidiary and wrote off certain intangible costs, primarily goodwill, and
other costs associated with the European nylon business. These costs
aggregated $14.1 million, or $.20 per share on an after tax basis.
     The effective income tax rate increased from 37.8% in 1993 to 44.1 % in
1994. This increase was mainly due to the non-deductible, non-recurring
charge in the current year while no such charge was incurred in 1993. Also
adversely impacting the current year's effective tax rate was the decreased
foreign earnings which are taxed at rates lower than the federal tax rate and
the increase in the statutory federal rate from 34% to 35% for all of 1994.
     Net income declined from $136.6 million or $1.93 per share in 1993 to
$76.5 million or $1.08 per share in 1994. Net income and net income per share
in 1994 before the non-recurring charge previously discussed were $90.6
million or $1.28 per share.

FISCAL 1993

Net sales increased 6.3% from 1.323 billion in 1992 to $1.406 billion in
1993. The sales growth resulted from volume increases as average pricing
based on overall product mix remained constant. Volume gains were seen in
both domestic and foreign markets. Growth in domestic markets came from
expenditures for improvements and capacity expansion. Unifi entered the spun
yarn business during 1993 through its acquisition of Vintage Yarns. During
the year the Company commenced production in a new texturizing plant at its
Yadkinville, NC facility, completed the modernization of its covering plants
and began upgrading the texturing equipment that provides yarn to its dyeing
operations.
     We also experienced volume increases in our European plants; however,
these operations were adversely impacted by weak economic conditions
prevalent throughout most of the year. The sales from foreign operations are

                                   20


























in local currencies and are hedged in part by the purchase of raw materials
and services in those same currencies. The net asset exposure is hedged by
borrowings in local currencies which minimizes the risks of currency
fluctuations. 
     Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales improved from 82.4% in 1992
to 81.2% in 1993. Based on our overall product mix, increases in
manufacturing costs and other components of cost of sales on a per unit basis
were offset by decreases in raw material costs.
     Selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant from 1992
to 1993 at $38.5 million, reflecting an improvement from 2.9% and 2.7% of net
sales, respectively. These improvements were mainly due to the centralization
of operations and the elimination of duplications in staff and support
systems.
     Interest expense increased from $16.8 million in 1992 to $25.8 million
in 1993. This increase was due primarily to the $230 million of convertible
subordinated debt outstanding during the current year. The debt was issued in
March 1992. Interest income increased from $5.3 million in 1992 to $13.5
million in 1993 due to higher investment levels stemming from the proceeds
made available from the issuance of the subordinated debt. Other income of
$5.8 million in 1993 was mainly comprised of gains from the sale of
investments in affiliates and from the sale of short-term investments in
marketable securities. Other income in 1992 of $1.6 million was derived
primarily from the equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates.
     In connection with the 1991 merger, the Company incurred approximately
$24.8 million of nonrecurring expenses that were charged to earnings in the
first quarter of 1992. These nonrecurring costs and expenses resulted in an
after-tax effect on net income of $18.4 million, or $.26 per share.
     The effective income tax rate decreased form 39.1% in 1992 to 37.8% in
1993. This decrease in the effective rate was mainly due to a combination of
nondeductible merger expenses in 1992 whereas there were no such expenses in
1993.
     Net income for 1993 was $136.6 million or $1.93 per primary share as
compared to net income of $96.8 million or $1.38 per primary share, in 1992.
Net income and net income per primary share for fiscal 1992 before the
effects of the nonrecurring merger expenses, previously described, were
$115.2 million and $1.64, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash generated from operations is a major source of liquidity for the
Company. During 1994, $130.8 million was generated as a result of net income,
adjusted for the effects of depreciation, amortization and noncash expenses
and decreases in both receivables and inventories offset by the decreases in
trade payables and accruals and income taxes.  The decrease in accounts
payable results from maintaining lower quantities of raw yarn inventory in
1994 than in 1993 and in connection with other reductions experienced with
the merged companies.
     In addition to cash generated from operations, the Company has access to
debt and equity markets. In 1992 the Company generated $104.7 from the sale
of Unifi common stock and approximately $230 million from the sale of 6%
convertible subordinated notes due March 15, 2002. The Company also maintains
reserves of liquid short-term investments which can be used for corporate
purposes as needed. Proceeds from these sources and existing reserves were
used primarily for repayment of debt of acquired companies and capital
expenditures.
     During 1994 the Company expended $104.7 million for additions to
property and equipment, $32.2 million for repayment of long-term debt
associated with acquired companies, $39.1 million for cash dividend payments
and $2.1 million for stock repurchase.
     At June 26, 1994 the Company has working capital of $304.3 million which
reflects a 3 to 1 current ratio (current assets compared to current
liabilities). This represents a decrease in working capital from June 27,
1993 of $320.2 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to the debt
repayments and purchases of property and equipment discussed above.
     On October 21, 1993, the Board of Directors authorized Management to
repurchased from time to time up to 15 million shares of Unifi's common stock
at such price as Management feels advisable and in the best interest of the
Company. It has not been determined how many shares, if any, will be
repurchased nor has the time frame been established in which such purchases
may take place. To date, approximately 98,000 shares have been repurchased by
the Company.
     Management believes the current financial position is sufficient to
complete anticipated capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions and
other financial needs. It is anticipated that the sale of our French nylon
facility will produce $16 million to $18 million.


           . . . and wherever there's fiber, there's Unifi.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Unifi, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unifi, Inc.
as of June 26, 1994, and June 27, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended June 26, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Unifi, Inc. at June 26, 1994 and June 27, 1993, and the consolidated results
of its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 26,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
